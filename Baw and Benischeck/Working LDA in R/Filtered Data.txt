We use this product in a Medical Office. I highly recommend these wipes. They definitely get the job done - 110%. Very reliable product.	&&&
i have been using these clorox wipes for as long as they were manufactured on the market. the fresh scent is just about right without being overbearing. one downfall is that I am unable to recycle these sheets but at least I know this works great in the disinfecting dept	&&&
My son has sensitive skin and these wipes have helped keep him clean with out the redness afterwards.	&&&
"Actually use less of these wipes bc they are quilted. Great price, cheaper brands cannot compare in quality."	&&&
They're wipes. They hold up to what they're needed for - if you're on the fence and reading reviews about wipes, Huggies fell apart in the free pack we received from the hospital and the Pampers Sensitive wipes have been far superior.	&&&
"This product is awesome, I dont know what I would do without Boogie Wipes during cold season or even just on those runny nose days. My children dont like getting their noses wiped but with Boogie Wipes they enjoy the Grape Scent. Even with a dry nose it doesnt dry out or irritate. Me and my husband have even got to where we use them too. I recommend them to all my friends and family. With 2 kids and a busy schedule of being a full time student/mom/wife these defently help. Thanks for making my life a little easier Boogie Wipes."	&&&
"I have very delicate skin and will get contact dermatitis from many ordinary household cleaners and products. I’m always looking for something a little more effective than facial cleaning cloths to remove makeup or to have handy to wipe off my hands.

I’ve found the Seventh Generation Thick and Strong Free and Clear Baby wipes fills the bill. I like their generous size. One will do the job. The manufacturer states: “New and improved Free & Clear baby wipes combine gentle, cloth-like performance with the thickness you need to wipe away little and big messes. As always, our baby wipes are free of alcohol, dyes, synthetic fragrances, parabens and phthalates”.

I use them for everyday messes, spills, kitchen counter wipe up and even to keep in my car. My main need is for a wipe that does not cause skin rash or break outs. These deliver on their promise. I plan to keep a spare pack handy.
I have very"	&&&
These are the best wipes! My son has sensitive skin, he reacts to the slightest change. We made the switch from Huggies wipes to Pampers sensitive wipes and they are much smoother against his skin. The fabric is silkier than the Huggies brand. We will continue to buy these Pampers wipes, this is a great deal with the subscribe and save on Amazon. You can't beat it!	&&&
I bought these to keep in my purse to wipe off things my toddler would be coming in contact with. They do wipe well but I gave them 3 stars because almost every single wipes rips coming out of the canister. That's extremely aggravating. The wipes don't seem to be poor quality but the thing they have to come through from the canister is just really rough. I would suggest carrying these in another container of some-sort.	&&&
These Windex Original Glass and Surface Wipes has turned out to be a must have in my home. I use them to clean my windows, mirrors, and glass table tops. I have glass table tops on my dinning room table, coffee, table, and end tables. They are always getting dirty from finger prints and food. The Windex Original Glass and Surface Wipes gets all of the tough dirt, and fingerprints off the tables and the scent of these wipes is amazing. I love using these wipes to clean my mirrors around the house. I also use them to clean the windows in my car as well. They are supper handy and although small in size they are great for big jobs. These wipes are tough and strong and can handle even the toughest of jobs.	&&&
Pampers Wipes are a great product. They are thicker than bargain brands and very absorbant. They are definitely worth paying the difference between a store brand and name brand. Plus the fragrance is very light and not over indulgent.	&&&
I love the fragrance, and the cloths are nice and thick, but they are fuzzy and leave behind that fuzz, so I don't plan on buying these again.	&&&
Contour Cpap Mask Wipes are the best. I've been using these wipes for the past two years. I wouldn't use any other wipes. Great price.	&&&
These are quick and easy and gentle on little baby bums.	&&&
I've used several different brands and types including the natural clean from Pampers and this is by far the best. It's not ultra wet or slimy or dry like all other products. My baby does not have sensitive skin but I like that these aren't slimy like the natural (care?).	&&&
"Great product. Necessary for colds. Moist towels keeps baby clean and dries up boogies."	&&&
These are a great price - especially with the 20% discount for subscribe and save :) I am expecting my 5th kid, so anything I can buy online to avoid having to go to the grocery store is great - especially when I can get it for a lower cost by not having to go out to get it.	&&&
"I've already called customer service to complain: please do so if you haven't already and you also agree that the ""new formula"" literally STINKS!
I am so relieved to see that I am not the only one who noticed the change in formula for these wipes. I actually compared the old and new packages because I still had some of the old ones unopened and there is definitely a change in the chemical formula. It appears that the chemicals with the ""cleaner"" scent were removed and other chemicals including Sodium Benzoate were added. I stay away from products containing Sodium Benzoate. I, like many others, noticed the off-putting smell and stinging sensation which is what prompted me to compare the ingredient listings on the packages. If you or your child has sensitive skin, these will irritate and burn! I've also noticed that the ""new"" smell is one commonly found in the ""cheap"" wipes you get at most grocery stores/major retailers. I already went to a major discount retailer to look for wipes with the ""old formula"" and was disappointed to find that the ""new formula"" appears in nearly all the major wipe manufacturers and generic equivalents. I was able, by literally digging through the stock on the shelves, to find the ""good"" formula on a store's generic brand of unscented wipes which happened to be the same as Costco's old formula. I bought what I could, but the rest were all the ""new formula."" It seems whoever Costco and the other manufacturers are contracting with to produce the wipes, changed the formula. Hopefully, there will be enough complaints nationally and through all of the wipe companies that the formula will revert! Since it appears that presently none of the wipes are without this unpleasant smell, I will no longer be buying these wipes either. I did consider returning the ones I had, but needed them and didn't have time to replace them so I ended up thoroughly rinsing them out (which in drought-stricken CA made these wipes expensive!)"	&&&
Delivered on time and product met all expectations.	&&&
I have these stashed everywhere. They work great on glasses, sunglasses, phone, iPad, and small mirrors. Great product.	&&&
I usually love Josie Maran products. I use the matchmaker foundation and the pure Argan oil on a daily basis, so I purchased this product thinking the quality would be just as good. However, the first time I used the wipes I started to feel a burning around my eyes. At first I didn't think that it was because of the wipes, so I used them again the next day. The burn was still there, and the next morning I noticed small bumps on the lid of my eyes outlining the bottom of my eyebrows. The bumps are still there after a week without using the wipes. Needless to say, I will never purchase them again, and I don't recommend them to anyone.	&&&
I love these wipes. They work very well and smell wonderful too. It really helps when you are short on time to be able to just grab one and start swiping your counter.	&&&
Work great for my male bichon who likes mark his spot in the house when I am not home.	&&&
"I have yet to use this product but I am excited to use wipes that that won't be so cold on my winter baby. And for myself!"	&&&
I originally tried Simple wipes because I had a coupon. I'm SO glad I tried them. They are amazing!!!! I have very sensitive skin and these Simple wipes are just that..."simple". Minimal ingredients that are not harsh for sensitive skin. My skin tends to be very dry and these are not drying to the skin. I'm also lazy and these are great for removing make-up, dirt and grime before I go to bed. They even remove caked on mascara. I highly recommend purchasing Simple wipes if you suffer from any of the above mentioned items.	&&&
My babies are allergic to all wipes except these. Thankyou pampers you are lfe savers!!!!!	&&&
"Not here! Zombie cooties? Don't think so! Enteroviruses? Uh-uh! Disgusting stuff lurking on my countertops? No way, Jose? Icky, sticky spills in the fridgagator? Oh Noooooo, Uncle Bill. And do you know why? Because I use Lysol Disinfecting Wipes. Those pesky killer viruses don't stand a chance here at Granny's house, thanks to Lysol. But really, check out Lysol on Wikipedia - this stuff has been around since 1888 and was used for a whole variety of weird stuff. Contraception and suicide? Kid you not.

Using Lysol makes me feel like I have some control over my tiny corner of the world, just like it did for my Grandma. Clean and clean smelling! Thanks Lysol and Amazon."	&&&
Once both my dog and his family got over the embarrassment - we realized how much we'd given up stressing over the accidents. Now we are all happy and normal again. I wish I'd discovered these before. I had heard dogs didn't like the male bands, that they were hard to keep on too. Not true. Well made and has helped my sweet 15 year old pup continue to hang out with the family and roam the house again. Until I discovered how easy it is solve the pee problem - he was often confined or in trouble. That's no way to spend the final years. He's happier and so am I. The little pack of wipes included with the diaper are handy, and keep his skin healthy. He's never leaked out of these. Boston Terrier - 15 lbs and the small fits him very well. He doesn't take them off and doesn't act like they bother him at all. It's helped his anxiety - knowing he's not in trouble. We call it a jock strap , to preserve his dignity. More than half the time the diaper is dry when I remove it to go outside. I use these as an alternative to the set of 8 washable bands also sold on Amazon. Both products have solved the problem. It's cheaper than paper towels and carpet cleaning and all that stress.	&&&
A must have household product, espeacially during the high flu season. I use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes on a daily basis in my household.	&&&
Bought these for my toddler and they hold up pretty well! they are a bit pricey so i normally buy when they are on sale or i buy walmart brand flushable wipes	&&&
These are the only wipes I will buy. My daughter has quite sensitive skin and these are quite frankly the best I've used. I even use them for myself	&&&
I love pamper wipes. I have used other products and they do not stand up the way pampers does. I 've had the others tear on me while I was just trying to get them out the tube. Pampers are always smooth and have not broken my baby out. I have used them for all three of my kids and will continue to use them. They are well worth the money. Love them.	&&&
Perfect for our New moms room at the office.	&&&
Yes, these are made for babies but as adults why haven't more of us caught on to these miracle wipes. Once you try them yourselves, wave bye bye to dry, less effective toilet paper.	&&&
...but too expensive to use for an incontinent male dog!	&&&
My boyfriend cannot live without these... for real. They have actually saved his life on a number of occasions. If you don't currently use "flushable wipes"... you should. What are you waiting for?! The time has come, my friend. Your cheeks with thank you. ;)	&&&
I have always given Papers an excellent review, and the problem w/ being able to read the rewards code on the wipes has been fixed. I give pampers a HUGE thumbs up for listening and caring about high quality products	&&&
This was bought as a gift for my sister. I have one and have used it every day for the past 2 years and 5 months. For those middle of the night changes, a warm wipe helps keep a sleeping baby...well, sleeping. A wipes warmer is a must have!	&&&
I was pretty skeptical about these Clorox Glass Wipes. It seemed far too easy! I was very surprised to discover how effective they were after using them in the bathroom and on a variety of surfaces. They do a fine job on windows and mirrors, cleaning easily without leaving streaks. The container is very convenient, and has found a permanent home in our bathroom for spot cleaning our large mirror. The Clorox name is one I trust and when the product is this convenient, you just can't ask for anything better.	&&&
Good wipes! They do a fantastic job!	&&&
They came as expected	&&&
I usually use this product 3-4 nights a week when I don't feel like washing my face before bed. It works well and leaves a nice scent and takes my makeup off. However, you will need to use moisturizer after because it will dry out your skin.	&&&
These are fantastic.	&&&
Love these. They do a good job, and smell great. I have them in the bathroom, kitchen, and on the computer desk. Just don't flush them in the toilet.	&&&
This is a dusting revolution, unlike just about all other cleaning products, it actually picks up dust.	&&&
Product as described.	&&&
Came with a new mom's guide. Thought that was pretty cool. Super soft great for baby and washing your own face without it being to harsh on your skin.	&&&
These are great for quick clean-ups. After wiping down the stovetop, I go over the top with a cloth towel to remove any smudges. Overall, it's an easy way to keep the ceramic top clean and streak free.	&&&
"Having just finished a road trip, I thought it would be really handy to keep a pack of these in the car for quick bug from the windshield removal. They don't work much better than the wipers with wiper fluid. The wipe is a better texture for glass than the ones I used on my kitchen counter, so that's a positive. But they are really sort of dry.

Though convenient, I think you are better off with a paper towel and a spray bottle of glass cleaner and once the windshield dried, it was a massive opaque smear."	&&&
"These smell great and they work great!"	&&&
They are durable and actually work, not to mention, they are easy on my babies sensitive skin. most other brands are dry, rough, and tear when being pulled out of the bag, i have never had this problem with pampers sensitive wipes and use them with every change!	&&&
This is a very good buy. They work great and don't seem to bother my baby's skin even if he has a diaper rash.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes!! Living in Florida and especially during the summer, sunscreen on my 9 month old is essential. These wipes are the absolute easiest way to apply sunscreen and take no time at all to wipe down my son's entire body with just one wipe. Since they are such a small package, I keep them in my diaper bag and always have them with me just in case we are out and I need to apply or re-apply sunscreen. I love that they are hypoallergenic and baby safe. They also do not smell like sunscreen and give off a very mild scent. I'm not sure I would use them as my only sun protection if we were going to be out at the beach or in direct sunlight for a while since I find it easy to miss spots if you aren't thorough with your application. But I probably wouldn't have a baby out in the sun for that long anyway. My only complaint is that there are only 20 wipes in the package - wish there were more!	&&&
The worst! Rating diapers and wipes isn't something I normally do. However, these are really terrible and we bought a huge pack that lasted forever. How to phrase this - the wipes do not pick anything up - they just smear it around and leave little pieces behind. It's almost as if the material is too slippery and too wet. My husband and I both commented repeatedly on how bad these were. We do a buy a competitor brand that has "natural" or similar in the title - it's a great product. Cleans in almost one swipe.	&&&
Love it. I have used this product with my brother kids and can't get enough. Thank you Huggies.	&&&
This is my second one - the one I used for my last baby I now use as a caddy in the laundry room for dryer sheets, clothespins, etc. Bought a different color when my third baby was born to keep on our ottoman downstairs for quick changes to avoid going upstairs to the nursery for every diaper change. These are made well and last - the drawer in front and pocket in the back are great for a burp cloth, diaper ointment, q-tips, etc. Been happy with it!	&&&
"These wipes sort of go against my philosophies that old fashioned ways are often times the best. I tried them on my kitchen window that is above my sink and often gets splashed. The window is not that big 2'x3'. One will not clean the whole window. They work out to about 9 cents each at this time which makes them more expensive than bottled cleaners and definitely more expensive than vinegar solutions.

I have a glass shelf for plants in another window. It is about 5' long and 1' wide; again, there was not enough moisture to clean the whole shelf. I have to admit it was easier to clean a vertical surface that is about my eye height with these than a spray bottle.

In the car, cleaning a window beside a toddler was easier with these - but for their general cleaning usage, the dryness and the sometimes spots they leave ... leave these way less useful than say disinfecting wipes."	&&&
Great wipes when you can find them on sale :/ comparable to your local bargain brand wipes. I've used many different brands and styles of wipes over the tests and have yet to find one im willing to spend a ton of money being I only use them for poop :/	&&&
This is a good wipe to remove face makeup and exfoliate away dead skin cells but BE CAREFUL not to use this wipe near the skin around your eyes. The skin is so delicate around your eyes that the roughness of this wipe will irritate and cause problems if used around the eyes. Use a separate wipe to remove eye makeup.	&&&
an excellent cleansing product for all rooms & all purpose especially the Clorox wipes. please send all products in bulk thank you brenda hicks	&&&
Received this product at a discount inv exchange for a review. Fast shipping, received it this afternoon. Used one of the washcloth on my toddler for bathing. Super soft and a large size compared to other washcloths. Definitely recommend.	&&&
Exactly as expected	&&&
Good for the price but they are pretty flimsy and thin. My daughter loves them to take her makeup off :) But I'm not a big fan for using them on poopy bottoms.	&&&
Love these wipes, they are nice and soft with a lot of moisture.	&&&
Works well. I didn't realize the top opens up and the sheets pop up. So I opened the side :)	&&&
"Great product
Good to use when you need to freshen up"	&&&
As a mom who had a C-section with minor complications I found that the Huggins sensitive unscented wipes not only cleaned my newborn perfectly with just one wipey but also helped me keep my incision site clean with no agitation to an already sensitive area... we as a family have them at home in the diaper bag stashed in the car as well as the family store for personal use as well as cleaning little messes around the store... we love them!!!!!!!!	&&&
Perfect, especially for the price	&&&
I carry these with me where ever I go. I use these when I am on my period and they make me feel fresh and clean. Love this product.	&&&
the dispenser I received does not seal shut when closed (at the white base area with the snap open closures). Therefore, my homemade wipes leak. I would assume that the designers would have wanted the thing to seal shut, but they have janky manufacturing.	&&&
I love Huggies Natural care better than pampers!	&&&
We have purchased Parent's Choice wipes for a couple of years or more because they initially were unscented, and priced reasonably. The last several months we have noticed that they have an odor to them, and it stays on your hands. What happened to supposedly being fragrance free???? We will be looking for another product!	&&&
I used these when I was at work and needed to pump multiple times. Better than just water. The only drawback for me was the price.	&&&
Very soft and pleasant wipes, great for any kind of lens, even anti-reflective. It MIGHT not get oils off of anti-reflective lenses though just because of how they are. If so use some water, soap (unless it's something really delicate), and a microfiber cloth to get that off.	&&&
This brand of wipes is great for cleaning up spills and messes any and everywhere! It doesn't leave a residue or a stinky smell.	&&&
Love these wipes! I use them almost every day! For everything! I have 3 kids and they're all under the age of 5 and this helps me so much in my everyday cleaning!	&&&
My daughter has very sensitive skin and this is the only wipe that doesn't irritate her or dry her skin out. Other products seem to cause issues after one or two uses. I can use these wipes on her hands, face and bottom. They're also thick and very moist even after being in the wipe warmer for several hours.	&&&
"I like these wipes, but they leave my face feeling very dry after using them, so that is a big disappointment to say the least. The wipes are really convenient. Simply pull and you have a wipe ready to use. There's no messing with cleansers or creams, and they remove not only makeup from your face, but also dirt that can be left behind.

The wipes have vitamins inside of them which is supposed to nourish the skin. I will agree that your skin is left feeling sensual after using.

The wipes are very affordable and have a gentle, and enjoyable, smell that remains on your skin after use.

I really wish they did not dry out my skin. A follow-up with a moisturizer, however, and I am good to go."	&&&
Pampers wipes are my ultimate favorite. After trying them out for the first time I have not had any other kind of baby wipes around the house. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Cottonelle is much softer and does a better job than when I tried it the first time. It's now my go to toilet tissue. Very soft and absorbent and really makes you feel clean. What more could you ask from a toilet tissue!	&&&
So disappointed in Huggies little Snuggiers. They leak every time. My boy is about 7 lbs and I was given many of them for my shower. I've tried both newborn and size 1.	&&&
Esthetically and convient for placement in bathroom. Scent is not overpowering in perfumes. A must have for all bathroom "Queens of clean!" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We absolutely LOVE these wipes! We buy the travel size, the box, the refills, everything! They are so gentle and don't irritate. I use them to remove my make-up too!	&&&
I love any Huggies wipes, but these have a fresh, clean scent and still have the durability of any other Huggies wipe.	&&&
Great product to freshen your face up.	&&&
Recently, I went camping with my friends and these wipes were perfect. I wasn't always able to make the hike back to the bathrooms, so these wipes helped me feel fresh and clean after a day in the sun. It took off the little makeup I had on, and it left my skin free of any overwhelming scents. I love that the most about these wipes is that you don't feel like your skin is being overwhelmed with chemicals. Pulling makeup off with scent-free wipes is what I want from now on! I would highly recommend these wipes to others, and I will continue to use them other than camping! I received these cleansing wipes for free in exchange for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love tarts but these didn't take off my eye makeup without a fair bit of effort and I strongly dislike the smell.	&&&
never received full refund	&&&
I recently bought this, order came in roughly a week and a half ago, and I couldn't be happier with these. Although I wish more can in the pack, one wipe is able to clean every single brush I use on a daily basis (5-7 brushes, at least). FANTASTIC PRODUCT; I would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone, and WILL definitely be buying again once I run out !"}	&&&
Great for cleaning my eyeglasses, sunglasses,etc. Get body oils, sunscreens off very fast. Keep a few packs in my car, office, golf bag, etc.	&&&
I love how you dont have to use as much as the thinner one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
If you need to remove medical adhesive, this is what to use. Does have a slight odor, but it is not unpleasant. Does not irritate my sensitive skin.	&&&
We used these continuously for cleaning our baby for the first year and half. She never had diaper rash then so we thought maybe it was fine to switch to Costco's brand. She immediately started having diaper rash and was very uncomfortable. We switched back to these and the problem went away. I'll never deviate from this brand again.	&&&
I use this wipe warmer every day,every hour,it is my bestfriend with a dirty diaper. Would like to have a push button to,open lid instead of me having to ooen it myself. Other than that, its amazing!!!	&&&
I use these for newborn wipes as I wanted something that I could just use with plain water during these initial stages while babies skin is super sensitive. These work great, they are soft and disposable and plenty large enough.	&&&
I always buy these at my local store but when I came across an 8 pack for $15, I had to buy it! First off, it is a great deal. Secondly, these wipes smells amazing! Cucumber melon to be exact! They are durable, thick, and get the job done! I've strayed away a few times to try other wipes out (when I coupons or see some on sale) but I always come back and won't stray away again. Highly recommend these wipes.	&&&
These are some of the best baby wipes I've ever used. I'm on my third child now, and I've been faithfully using these Pampers wipes since she's been in this world. I love the softness of these wipes because they leave my child's skin feeling so soft and silky. I've even used them for my own hygienic needs, and they make me feel refreshed. The only thing I don't like about them is how quick they tend to dry in the wipe warmer, but other than that they work really well. I also use them to sanitize a room, wiping counter tops and walls. These are just perfect as an all-around sanitizer, and they leave my baby smelling so powdery fresh. I highly recommend these to any mother who wants to make sure her baby is kept clean.	&&&
These wipes are absolutely the best! They wipe away all traces of foundation, primer, eye shadow and even eyeliner and mascara. The wipes are very strong and don't fall apart, and they stay moistened inside the packaging. They don't dry your skin out and you can go straight to bed after wiping away the day from your face. I used to use the over-the-counter drugstore brand until I discovered these wipes from MAC. I will never go back to another brand.	&&&
I gave these wipes one star because they are so flushable they tear during use, and they're way too small for an adult derriere (butt)! I was so convinced I was going to like them, since I love their tissue, I purchased 2. Waste of money. The only complimentary thing about these wipes is the cute plastic container it comes in. We usually use baby wipes and will go back to them. Don't buy these if your priority is keeping your hands clean in addition to your bottom!	&&&
My baby is now 2 weeks old, and I have been using these wipes since I got home from the hospital. I would definitely recommend them! If you're looking for wipes that aren't too wet, absorb well, or aren't too scented, these wipes are for your baby!	&&&
"We're doing cloth diapers, and it makes sense to do cloth wipes as well (same load, less waste of disposable wipes). I've tried the Bummis flannel wipes as well, and those are too soft to have the traction necessary to get our son's bottom truly clean.

I wet these and use California Baby Diaper Area Wash to ensure he gets really clean."	&&&
"Love these Johnson and Johnson hand and face wipes! My son has recently had a runny nose and they are great for my purse and my diaper bag for the car and wiping my son up after a meal or the park or when his nose is runny!"	&&&
"Great product. Great for traveling, going back to work, or those late night feelings. Makes cleaning a lot easier if you are in a hurry."	&&&
"Finally found a wipe that works great & at a good price."	&&&
I purchased this tote 4 times for 4 different baby showers for friends and family. The items included are a great gift for moms to be with whom you may have a casual and/or close relationship. It is perfect for co-workers, friends, and family. You can add more gifts to this tote to personalize and add the WOW factor. That is what I did for my best friend and she loved it! I highly recommend this product. I wish I could add another star!	&&&
"Very handy since my daughter doesn't hold her pacifier very well and you don't always have water available to clean it. Really like it."	&&&
Can't wait to be done with the 'value' brand we received to go back to these :) If you need to use 3-4 wipes per diaper...they aren't a good value. We can use the Pampers for more cleaning and holds up better...cost difference is small and MUCH more effective	&&&
"I'm not sure how well these clean/santize pump parts, but it's better than nothing when I'm at work for 8+ hours & cannot wash/sanitize pump parts between pumpings."	&&&
not only great for my babies, but great for my whole family!	&&&
My son has a very low immune system unfortunately so I am constantly cleaning and disinfecting so he will not get sick. Since I have been using Lysol Disinfectant Wipes we have cut the doctor trips in half. We have a big family and we tend to pass germs around and around. It has helped to keep the germs from being passed back and forth which is a miracle and they are so easy to use, just wipe!	&&&
I follow the instructions, it lasts for a few months. I rinse them out and add more water every time I add more wipes to my warmer. I have never had a problem with bacteria or mold growing in my wipe warmer or the wipes themselves. I love my machine and these replacement pillows are a great price on Amazon.	&&&
I purchase these on the Subscribe and Save program on a monthly basis to keep our bathroom clean in between deep cleanings - wiping up the toilet rim, seat and lid, around the base of the toilet, the edges and faucets on the sink and tub, as well as the trash can. I've been very pleased with the performance of this product and will continue to buy them in the future.	&&&
My son is 2 and we tried different wipes in the beginning. But, we always went back to pampers wipes. They are truly the best brand at an affordable price.	&&&
Love this wipes !!!	&&&
used from the start works as advertised. like the scent as not overpowering	&&&
"These are THE SOFTEST washcloths I have ever laid my hands upon. They come packaged perfect and would make an awesome baby shower gift. I couldn't wait to give them a try on my girls. My daughter even mentioned ""mom they are so soft"". They lathered up nicely and I can only imagine how great they felt on her skin. I'm going to maybe have to steal one for myself :). An added bonus is that they are organic. Order these; you won't be disappointed!

I received this product for a discount based on my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
lovely smell and wipes good	&&&
"Love these wipes. Make bathroom cleaning a breeze. They are even flushable.
They do have a scent, but I haven't found it to be overpowering or lingering."	&&&
I absolutely love this WaterWipes product because not only does it really work to clean, but it is chemical free and made with all natural ingredients. These are perfect for cleaning and diapering your baby's skin because they are so soft and gentle and are great even if your baby has sensitive skin. These WaterWipes feel soft, but they are strong and durable so they won't break apart and they help prevent diaper rash on my baby's skin. I also love using these to clean hands and faces as well as a quick body wash. They are made with only two ingredients, water and grapefruit seed extract, so you can feel good about using them and they are great for the planet. These are a quick and convenient way to keep your baby clean and I would recommend them to moms everywhere. I received this product to facilitate my review, all opinions are my own.	&&&
Love this product for its softness and yummy smell.	&&&
This has a pleasant scent and pleasing price point. I will buy these again. Have not decided whether I'll buy this brand wipe exclusively, but am leaning towards that.	&&&
This is the best facial wipe I have ever used. It is fresh, clean. Very good	&&&
I love it, but more importanlty, the cats love it. Product arrived very promptly and I've been using it regularly ever since.	&&&
Amazing quality! Enjoying using these for facials! When I first purchased these I wasn't sure what I'd be getting, but they are disposable cotton, woven so they are durable, folded into four. Hold up strongly when wet. They aren't meant for scrubbing like muslin cloth, but they do a really nice job removing facial products. They stand up to removing masks and skin treatments really well in my treatment room. You can unfold them and use various sides making one last a whole lot longer than a cotton pad. I will definitely be buying these again when I run out! A good quantity came in the package too which means I'll have them for awhile.	&&&
These are used in my house for dish cloths. They are small, fit into glasses easily and are not difficult to rinse and wring out. Dry very fast so not prone to souring and stinking. When they wear out just toss them in the trash.	&&&
Very wet. Soft but sturdy cloth. No overpowering scent.	&&&
Fast shipping. Perfect for kids backpacks and for my purse!	&&&
"I was planning on using these as a mouth refresher for my dogs... because doggy breath is a little too much sometimes. However, I am really impressed. I was cleaning a tooth on my 10 lb chi that had some yellow tartar there for quite a while- after using these for a couple of days, the tartar just came right off! I couldn't believe it! All 4 of my dogs enjoy the flavor and allow me to clean their teeth while they either sit or lay still.
One of my dogs even tries to eat the pads whole (so be careful)!
All of their mouths smell much fresher and the wipes are super easy to use in the little and big mouths! Easier than brushing.
I recommend this product."	&&&
"These washcloths are wonderfully soft, and light. Great for my face and no artificial colors to worry about. I have extra sensitive skin, so I am cautious when purchasing anything that has to do with my face.

""I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest & unbiased review!"""	&&&
"Love these wash clothes. They are soft and sturdy. They are gentle on the baby's skin. These can be used for baby or adult, perfect for either one. I highly recommend these for any parent or someone with sensitive skin. I really like these because of my skin issues. Not to mention I use these on my newborn son.

I was recently given these for my thoughts and review. All thoughts are my own and no other. There has been no other compensation given."	&&&
very good wipes	&&&
Fits in the diaper bag well and cleans his bottom without a fight. Durable.	&&&
Bought these as a last minute purchase for my trip to Seattle. They were affordable & in the travel section at Target so the pack that I got fit perfectly in my travel bag. The scent of the wipes is quite refreshing. The wipes itself were so soft & very gentle on the skin. Leaves your skin feeling moisturized & removes make-up with ease. Especially around the eyes :) Awesome product & I would totally purchase again.	&&&
I love these! They smell great, keep your children clean, and theyre flushable!! I even like using them!	&&&
Don't leave home without it.	&&&
I recommend huggies. My daughter breaks out to everything. Huggies was the only diapers and wipes she doesn't breakout to	&&&
These wipes are oil free. My sister uses these wipes to clean her face and wipe away mac eye make up. She has oily skin. 1 pack in a drug store in nyc costs almost $8, so this is a good deal.	&&&
Great for on the go. The scent is a little strong. For the price I could use a baby wipe.	&&&
I've been using these wipes for a while now and I really like them. Not too much lotion or soap in them and they clean really well. I have dry skin and these wipes do not dry out my face. I would recommend that you give them a try.	&&&
Bought these moitor wipes to clean my laptop screen and ended up using em on most of my electronics with a monitor i.e. my phone, digital camera and television set. Really good value for the price and comes with a lot of wipes.	&&&
We tried other wipes and she would cry out because I think they hurt her bottom when she had diaper rash, but not with these! So we've started ONLY using these wipes all the time! They work great and I'll never switch!	&&&
The go to disinfecting wipe at our home! These are a must have for any type of mess around the house! Quick, easy, and effective!	&&&
Strong, durable, great for the price. Many options for babies (sensitive, frag. Free, etc) gets the job done. Packs last a good while, and you don't need many wipes to get the job done!	&&&
Nice to have on you these days!	&&&
I use the Pacifica Cleansing Wipe to remove my makeup every night. They are gentle and leave my skin feeling clean and moisturized with out that greasy feeling. These are my #1 choice for cleansing.	&&&
Thanks to Influenster, I was able to try this product for free. It is definitely a great product. This product makes it easy to remove waterproof mascara. It is gentle on my sensitive skin.	&&&
Pampers wipes are the only wipes we have loved... Soft & clean [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love cleansing facial wipes like these. They are so gentle and perfect to toss in your gym bag for easy post gym face clean-up. They are also great to keep by the nightstand for when I'm too lazy after a long day to do my regular face wash routine. Also perfect for vacations in your overnight bag when you don't want to worry about accidental leaks or confiscations in your carry on. Won't get all your mascara, but perfect for a quick easy wipe-down.	&&&
It removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean.	&&&
These wipes are soft & clean nicely. Baby was sensitive to others	&&&
I go out of my way to buy this specific cleaner. It works great and not to dry or to wet.	&&&
little but good	&&&
i love these wipes. after using huggies (way too wet! made my baby prone to rash because of moisture content), pampers, and many others, i finally decided to try these. the botanic label reeled me in, not gonna lie :) but what is really nice about these wipes is they have a bit of texture to them, so i find it very easy to wipe up poopy messes because it tends to stick to these wipes better than others i've used. i've never noticed a texture like this on other wipes, and i'm hooked! i always buy sensitive skin (fragrance, alcohol, etc free) and i am pleased with how these work on my daughter's skin. diaper rashes are rare for us, and when she does get them, it's because of something she ate, NOT the moisture or ingredient content of the wipes. i have full confidence in these wipes and am glad i found them. i can't use anything else! my only complaint is when you get to the last few wipes, they are incredibly difficult to pull out. a slight annoyance when you have a poopy diaper to change, but there are ways to prepare ahead of time for the situation ;-) not enough of an annoyance to ever switch to something else.	&&&
These will wipe the messes up from everything! Not just the poo... keep these in my diaper bag for hands and faces, in my kitchen for after meals, in my bathroom for my toddler (although they get thrown away, not flushed), and I even use them to clean spots off my furniture fabric (canvas). These are so much better than the greasy other brand that slide over the mess. These will pick it up! I can get away with one or two for a blow out even. Love these.	&&&
"I'm a mom to three kiddos and I've been using these Huggies One and Done wipes for easily several years now. Besides the smell being great, these wipes are thick (so you get the job done with fewer) and well perforated (so that when you reach in your wipe warmer to pull them through, they come right up instead of getting caught and shredding in your fingers). At times, I've tried using Pampers wipes to remember why exactly I don't like them and then it all comes flooding back -- although the Pampers ones smell nice too, they are just nowhere near as thick and I find that they shred much easier which is the last thing I want to deal with when trying to change a diaper!

Also, I've found that these wipes seem to last longer when I carry them around in a portable wipes case. I realize that a portable case isn't as airproof as my wipes warmer at home, but the thickness and moisture of the Huggies Wipes gives them longer life in the portable case than the Pampers Wipes."	&&&
"These are fantastic cleaning wipes. I've had some other brands in the past that tend to leave streaks on things but these are totally streak free.

I use them for a ton of different things. Cleaning eyeglasses and sunglasses, cleaning computer screens, cleaning camera lenses, etc. I even use them for cleaning electronics such as laptops, etc. You can basically use these to clean anything that it's safe to use alcohol on. Each wipe is individual packed in a small foil packet (much like a little moist towelette you get with take-out food) so you can conveniently carry a few of them in your pocket for easy glasses cleaning on the go."	&&&
i like these somewhat better than pampers sensitive because they are textured so they clean my babies skin more easily which is great but they're very basic and thinner than the average wipe.	&&&
great and very handy	&&&
Great handy little wipes. In a public area with surfaces that have not been cleaned in who-knows-when? These little things are just the ticket! Speaking of tickets, be sure to pack a few on your next trip, flight, etc. Remember to stay home if you are sick, wash your hands for 30 seconds, and cough into your elbow. To your health!	&&&
I love these cleaning wipes! We use them on everything, so effective and gives a great sent, not to mention it's killing all the germs as you clean! Boom!!!	&&&
Much prefer these wipes over a spray product; furniture looks good & easy to use.	&&&
I love this have it in the bathroom for quick cleanings through out the week :)	&&&
I love Germ-X Antibacterial Soft Wipes and have used them for years. My wife and I carry them everywhere we go. They are a very convenient way to clean your hands when a washroom is not available. They also do a good job of cleaning up minor spills on your shirt or pants.	&&&
...and little ones too. No scent which is good for sensitive skin.	&&&
Great product.	&&&
bought product for a friend and she's satisfied. great deal too	&&&
these wipes are great for bums, hands, faces ,,, everything we use them all the time:)	&&&
I bought these a couple of times and i didn't really care for them, I think they dry out quickly and I didn't particularly care for the sent.	&&&
Good price for a large quantity. I use these all over the house	&&&
"This was bought as a gift for my sister. I have one and have used it every day for the past 2 years and 5 months. For those middle of the night changes, a warm wipe helps keep a sleeping baby...well, sleeping. A wipes warmer is a must have!"	&&&
I seriously don't know what I did before I discovered these swipes. I use them everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. They work great after a work out or to refresh my items after they have been sitting in my closet for too long. They also make great gifts.. I can't wait to try the other scents.	&&&
arrived on time, was as expected	&&&
Truthfully I like these wipes but any generic brand will work just the same. At the same time they will also be cheaper.	&&&
I think I have tried every eye makeup remover out there and this is the first product I've ever used that doesn't burn my eyes. The Good: Large soft sheet, extremely moist, does a great job removing makeup. The Bad: the scent is overpowering, it's just way too strong	&&&
Price was pretty reasonable, nothing else to say, its clorox wipes	&&&
These are excellent wipes, have tried many. Value is above all the ones I have tried..500 for the price I paid cannot be beaten anywhere!	&&&
good value. I use alot of handi wipes. glad I found the big pack.	&&&
These wipes are a 5 star in quality. I've tried just about every brand out there for my children. Pampers are soft, but gave my kids diaper rash. Seventh Gen and Burt's were too rough on them and made their bums all red and sore after a few days use. Honest wipes are my favorite, but the price on Amazon is too much. You can get them cheaper at Target. Even at $4.99 a pack at Target or from the company the price gets a little steep with 2 kids under 2, so I often settle for my second choice - Huggies Naturals; however I pick up a pack of these when I can afford it or if they are in sale. BUT reading the reviews about the factory the wipes are made in disappoints me greatly which makes me rate these only at a 3. I'll have to do more research into the manufacturer.	&&&
The wipes are awesome... but they're hard to pull out of the lid...	&&&
Love these wipes. I have used them on all my babies. I subscibe and save so I get an additional 20% which makes it a great deal.	&&&
Im very familiar with this brand. I've always bought the regular (blue packet) wipes or the night calming lavender (purple packet) version for YEARS, so I'm not new to Neutrogena. I decided to switch up and try grapefruit (pink packet) since I love grapefruit juice (besides the point). It does it's job by removing all my makeup however it's at a price. After it dries up which is about 10 seconds after I'm down wiping, I'm left in agony as my face is being torched. It irritates as if someone threw acid in my face and leaves my poor, suffering, tingling skin extremely sensitive to the touch. I thought maybe it was just me so I had my sister and mother try it. Nope, it affected all three of us, my sister actually cried from the terrible sensation. Is there bleach or Ajax in the ingredients or something because it's not listed and that's a lawsuit all in itself. I will never in my life buy this acidic poisonous grapefruit scent ever again or accept it for free. I learned my lesson trying to try something new.	&&&
It's not the same brand I got there a long time ago, but it does the same job of cleaning my computer screen and key boards. The wipes are not very wet. I also can't get the cloths thru the opening of the top and have to open the whole lid to get one. Otherwise, it works for me.	&&&
Great for beach days! Great for flying the Hawaiian skies! Great for any on the go days!!	&&&
Works well	&&&
Love this product. I've used these wipes with 3 babies and non of my babies have had a reaction from the wipes. I love the clean, not slimy feeling, these leave and they don't have a smell. I also love that I can leave a box out and not worry about fluid leaking if they tip over (they are just the right wetness).	&&&
These wipes are great, we use them all the time. Just be careful whe they are being shipped, they are in a cheap hard plastic contrainer that cracks and opens easily, as we've experience upon receipt.	&&&
Best smelling wipes ever. And they are strong too. I use these wipes for everything	&&&
We have a two year old and a newborn, so we go through LOTS of wipes. We found, after trying just about every wipe out there, that pampers work the best of all. You end up using less than the cheaper brands, and they are gentler on those little bottoms.	&&&
Love pampers wipes. I always use to use a different brand and these are so much better. Very moist and cleans up well for everything!	&&&
MY FAVORITE WIPES!! i HAVE THEM IN STOCKED IN EVERY BATHROOM AS WELL. The cucumber ones smell so refreshing!	&&&
These wipes do the trick and I keep buying them. Nice smell and our dog tolerates them after walks when he just needs a bit of freshening up.	&&&
These washcloths are so nice and soft. I use them for my kids and myself. I'll be purchasing a few more to gift to my mom since she uses them on a daily basis. They're a good gift idea as well for baby showers. This is my honest opinion but I did get this for a discounted price.	&&&
WOW these washcloths are so nice. I received an offer to try these Naturally Natures Bamboo Baby washcloths at a discount for my honest review. I am so glad I did because these are so so soft. They have a soft silky feel to them and I plan to try them for myself and not just baby. The washcloths are so gentle that you don't have to worry about they being to rough for your baby. They came in a nice plastic case of six so that they are displayed nicely, which is great if you want to purchase for a baby shower. These would make a great gift for a baby shower or for your own baby, child or yourself. They are not those little tiny things that you can barley keep on your hand when trying to wash your baby. They are a good size but not to big They are made of good quality material and being Organic and all natural makes them even better. I am really impressed and would recommend these to everyone, for gifts, for yourself. I may have to buy more and give them as gifts because I am loving them that much. They are sewn well and seems that they will last. This is a wonderful product and I give an A+++ do buy.	&&&
These are the best for any little one with a runny nose it's soft and gentle. Also with the light saline the moisture makes cleaning dry boogers a little easier.	&&&
Good scent and soft. We always buy the multipack.	&&&
These are the best wipes to use - the thickness is great and they really clean baby without having to use lots of wipes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Our daughter is 2 months now and we just LOVE these wipes. I have tested out other wipe brands and nothing matches the thickness, sensitivity to skin and price as these wipes do. It's nice to only have to use a few instead of needing well over 5 to clean up the bigger messes.	&&&
I opened that package when I arrived home, to find that the foil top had been removed, and that half the wipes had already been used - RIDICULOUS!!!!	&&&
"We originally received this as a gift, but after a while, the lid wouldn't close anymore because a piece fell out. Luckily, we had great customer service from Oxo and they sent us a new one immediately and it has worked perfectly for many months now.

""Perfect pull wipes"" describes this perfectly. I can easily pull out one wipe at a time without having to fight with the package of wipes, which sometimes get stuck together. It makes wiping up a squirmy baby a breeze when you don't have to fumble with the package. It may seem a bit expensive for a wipes dispenser, but when you have a poopy disaster and you're trying to hold an active baby so she doesn't spread poop all over, this will be worth the money."	&&&
My son has sensitive skin, so we have to be smart about the wipes we use. These have been tops for getting his skin clean and not irritating his skin. With Subscribe & Save, we no longer have to worry about the dreaded, mid-diaper change, "Oh no... we're out of wipes!!" Plus, with 5 orders in our Subscribe & Save, we get these for 20% off. Awesome!	&&&
I love, love, love boogie wipes. The reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is the plastic package on these is not the same as what I get in the store. The packaging is definitely cheaper. However, the product is the same, and I use these all the time. Great for sensitive skin. I also can't stand the smell of regular baby wipes, but these are pleasant.	&&&
I USE THESE ALL THE TIME IN MY KITCHEN. THEY ARE VERY DURABLE AND DONT GET THAT BAD STINKY SMELL LIKE SOME DISHRAGS DO. WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT THEM!!	&&&
"$6.00 for 12 flannel wipes...$0.50 cents per wipe, can't beat the price! Great quality too! We got two packs, and that is plenty to start! Great for spills, spit up, quick bib for formula feedings, you name it. Great for wipes too! We make our own wipe solution, put it in a spray bottle, and we're good to go. Toss them in the diaper pail with your cloth diapers, and wash as usual.

Love these, so natural looking with the multi-color thread surge edge, very cute. :D"	&&&
Very handy individual wipes that keep your optics and glasses clean, streak free and safer for plastic or coated lenses.	&&&
Used these with my daughter and for the first 12 months with my son. I noticed the new "Botanic" label on the box this past time that I purchased them. They used to be thick and soft. Now they feel like paper. Not soft at all. I'll be switching brands. Bad move, Target, for fooling with a great product.	&&&
I'm not sure how well these clean/santize pump parts, but it's better than nothing when I'm at work for 8+ hours & cannot wash/sanitize pump parts between pumpings.	&&&
I def. liked the texture that these wipes have on them.	&&&
I am very disappointed with these wipes. They are extremely thin and get awkward folds in them after being dried in the dryer. I think my Sam's Club toilet paper is thicker than these wipes. I wish I would have spent the extra money and got more Fuzzibuns or Thirsties wipes. Both of those are great, with the Thirsties being superior. The Thirsties are so thick and plush - I never worry about the poop leeching through like I do with the Bumkins. I always have to fold over the Bumkins to protect my hands from the nasty diaper messes...and sometimes I end up needing two wipes because these are so thin and don't get the job done. I just ordered some Grovia wipes and am looking forward to trying those, as they have good reviews. I went with those instead of the Thristies because the Thirsties are just so expensive, but if I am disappointed with the Grovias I will bite the bullet and get more Thirsties. Don't buy the Bumkins wipes - you're better off using a paper towel!	&&&
I really like these wipes. I've tried several different brands of sensitive wipes and these seems to be the stronger and softer than most.	&&&
Easy to order, great variety in package. Exactly what I was looking for and it was delivered to my doorstep.	&&&
"After buying these for the first time, I wish I had started using them years ago. Since they're so much more convenient and effective than the paper towel/spray cleaner routine for small jobs, I find that I clean things more often. I also use these to quickly clean bathroom tiled floors and laminate flooring by placing them under a dry or damp sponge mop. So much easier than a wet mop. Also great for cleaning dog paws before letting them in the house.

Two issues: the containers aren't sealed with a foil or cellophane peel-away cover and I'm not sure how long the plastic top prevents the wipes from drying out if not used frequently. I sealed the top of the unused ones with saran wrap and a rubber band until I'm ready to use them. Also, when used as instructed, the wipes are hard to pull out so the tip of the next wipe pops out, requiring the top to be opened to get to the next wipe. The lid has two tabs at the center opening which can be pushed down. These tabs CAN prevent the next wipe from coming through. It actually works best if these tabs are pulled up instead, above the two ""stops"", as this allows the next wipe to be pulled out enough so it's ready for next time."	&&&
I love these things! I dogsit a little chihuahua mix who likes to mark his territory and also piddles when he gets too excited. I put one of these on him before he comes in my house and I don't have to worry about my furniture! The fit is great. A little stiff at first, so he walks funny for a few minutes but the dog doesn't seem to mind, and once it breaks in he seems to forget about it. I've had zero leaks. These things stay put! I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because every once in a while I get a tab that isn't fully attached. A piece of scotch tape solves the problem in a snap though.	&&&
We've been using these since our NICU days and in a house with some sensitive skin kiddos they are a dream for cleaning yucky bums to wiping Nutella off of faces. I also love that I have to use less wipes with this brand than with others to get the job done.	&&&
Absolutely love these wipes and much fewer diaper rashes!	&&&
Fast shipping these is the olny kind wipes i love	&&&
"My baby love to play with her pacifier and bottles but this helps me so much specially when I am always on the go. I am always looking out for the health of my baby so I always try to have everything she plays with clean first and this wipes has help me with that and I feel more comfortable that everything my baby out in her mouth is clean. Highly recommend this product. Happy mommy happy baby!"	&&&
"First off these cloths are super and fluffy which makes them ideal for babies. They are totally bigger than other types I have purchased. Eco safe materials (bamboo) are used to ensure a earth friendly product. The washcloth came individually wrapped in a satin ribbon, super cute and all of them were contained in a outer plastic reclosable pouch. My daughter who as a baby would have loved these, is really into using them on her problem eczema areas on her face. She can really notice a difference from the current ones we use now. Great for baby showers or any one needing a soft cloth for hygiene.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I was given the above mentioned product free in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
Nice size and pretty tough but I prefer "One Wipe Charlies" because of the tingle.	&&&
My three month old is super chunky and was getting a rash in his neck rolls. Even with wiping out his rolls, keeping them dry, and occasionally applying ointment, nothing was making it go away. The other day I just wiped his neck down with one of these Nose and Face Wipes and his rash was almost gone the next morning! I don't know what's in these...but they work to keep my baby's neck clean and rash free!	&&&
these sell nice and work well but are very thin and not as "cloth like" as i thought they would be.	&&&
These are the softest towel I've ever felt. Now please note I have no kids, I didn't even think towels could possibly get this soft, but I can understand why someone would want it. I'd use this for myself and my vehicle (I love my truck). When I initially hear bamboo I don't think soft and cushiony, I think rough, but these towels have made me a believer, natural bamboo baby towels are the way to go for a gentler clean for whatever you're washing!	&&&
I purchased these for my nephew and his new baby and his wife loves them. I hit it out of the park on this one. His wife is a stickler about quality and she loved these bamboo washcloths. Great product and a great company.	&&&
These baby washcloths are soooooo soft. They would be perfect for a baby's delicate skin. But I have to admit, I got them for me. I thought they would be great for washing my face because the older I get the more fragile my skin gets. These would also wonderful for anyone with delicate, sensitive, or fragile skin. Now that I have tried them and know how wonderful they are and what a generous size they are (10" x 10"), I will probably order some for my father who is diabetic and has to be careful with his skin. The cloths are pretty, pale, neutral colors that are great for baby boys or girls or adults. They are spun from natural fibers or bamboo plants making them eco friendly and long lasting. They are really a great buy for yourself or as a gift. I purchased my set of baby washcloths at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.	&&&
"These wash clothes are absolutely fantastic. They would be a perfect gift for a baby shower or a baby basket. My children love these during shower time to hold over their eyes when I wash their hair. I also use them for my own face because of how soft they are.They are also quite big! They are super soft and luxurious. Even after washing them several times they are just as soft as when they were new. I love how they have little bows on them when you get them. These are very well made.

I received a sample in return for my honest unbiased opinion. My opinion is based solely on my use of the product."	&&&
This is my first experience with bamboo products. I have wanted to try them for a long time and now that I have a new grandson this set of washcloths caught my eye. They are super soft and are larger than the average baby washcloth. The colors are soft and neutral and will make a great baby shower gift. I highly recommend this set. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.	&&&
I keep these in my bag that I take to work every day. They're awesome. My only gripe is they smell. Not a "bad" smell, but I feel like they should be scent-less.	&&&
These are great! No complaints.	&&&
These are probably the SOFTEST wash cloths I have ever owned. I initially bought this for my kids to use when they are taking a shower but I think I will keep a couple for me to use too! The cloth material they used is super soft and you can really see it's high quality cloth. My husband was the one who opened the package when it arrived and the first thing he said was.. "Wow these are so soft!!". The packaging is really cute too. It will make a great present specially for baby showers. The cute little polka dot bow that wraps around the towel makes it look really cute and elegant. So for me, this is a 5 star wash cloths. It's not only great for babies but great for kids and also adults. The size if also just right for a wash towel. lastly I want to disclose that I bought this at a discounted price in return of my unbiased review. Me and my family loves it so we are rating this 5 STAR! Very highly recommended!	&&&
This product works so well. Not only does it work for my child, but it smells great as well. I never need to use another product!	&&&
Towelettes are practically dry. I have to use two each time and still don't get enough to cover a suitable area.	&&&
Have been using these for over two years now. Never had a problem with them.	&&&
we used the regular wipes and they seemed to be making her butt red we changed to these and it went right away. its worth the buy if your baby has sensitive skin.	&&&
Definitely love these wipes for my little one. He has sensitive skin but these wipes don't bother him at all. They are so durable and I don't have to use half a pack just for one diaper like with some wipes. No over-powering perfume smell either which is great.	&&&
Good brand love it for my kids.	&&&
I love these wipes for me. They come out moist and has a fresh scent. Love that it snaps and seals back too.	&&&
I always keep a container of these in my kitchen cupboard. So easy for quick cleaning and I love they aren't heavily scented with "chemicals". tip: make sure you really dampen the surface and keep it wet (I forget the exact time period) for maximum disinfecting.	&&&
I love how sturdy it is and it fits a lot of wipes	&&&
Loves parents choice products and the wipes are great and great price they don't have a funny smell	&&&
These makeup remover wipes work great at removing all kinds of makeup. They are gentle on the skin they do not sting your eyes. They also remove waterproof makeup.	&&&
Bought these because they were suggested when I placed my online order as being a better value. These wipes are horrible. They do not remove anything from the board. They just make the board wet and then they leave a film that causes a terrible smear when you erase. Water and a paper towel would do a better job.	&&&
i love huggies wipes!! cheap and effective!! very great for sensitive babies as well! always used them for my childrens	&&&
Huggies wipes are.peronally my favorite. They are thick and textured and also great smelling.compared to others. I stingy recommend these to all mommies.	&&&
I have yet to use this product but I am excited to use wipes that that won't be so cold on my winter baby. And for myself!	&&&
I do love these wipes. I work in the health field and am a mommy of three so disinfecting things is my job!!	&&&
I use these all the time for various household cleaning tasks - wiping counters, cleaning the bathroom, etc. These wipes smell great and also disinfect!	&&&
These were convenient for use at an outdoor birthday party where children and animals were running around. They were much better to use than the spray when in a large crowd.	&&&
Great wipes! I wish they were just slightly softer. They are great for our toddler for but the new born they could be just a bit softer.	&&&
The price of the sensitive wipes is super competitive along with the great coupons online. Love using these for my daughter!!	&&&
Love these wipes! They are nice and thick. Haven't had one rip or pull apart yet. I can change most diapers with just one of these.	&&&
Great for cleaning my tablet, PC, laptop cases and screens	&&&
The wipes not only take off all my make up (including the waterproof) it leaves my skin so soft and I feel clean after using it. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't bother my skin.	&&&
I love pampers wipes because I know for a fact that I use less than if I was using a different brand. They are very good quality, smell nice, and are a great size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I've used these in the past, work great.	&&&
I am very impressed with this product and it is great for cleaning electronics.	&&&
We used to use clorox wipes, but these are much more pleasant. They smell great and they clean as well as anything does. Highly recommended!	&&&
"Excellent price, great product."	&&&
When I opened these up, they were losing a lot of threads. After I put them in the wash, that stopped, but I'm concerned as to how long they will actually last. The cloths themselves are soft and perfect for oil cleansing my sensitive skin!	&&&
Very cool to use!!! Simply aweosme!!	&&&
I find it hard to say positive things about something I use to clean the floor!!! But, yes they are very good and work quite well....Never thought I would have to comment on this product!!!	&&&
"These are wonderful cloths and so very soft. We cloth diaper and also use cloth wipes. These are now in our cloth wipe rotation. I use these in our wipes warmer with water, rose water, argan oil, jojoba oil, lavender, manuka, tea tree, pure fractionated coconut oil, a few squirts of sulfate free natural baby soap, and pure aloe vera.

These wash up well and have gone through the dryer on extra low twice. Recently I have just been removing these after washing and skip the dryer since they are going straight into the warmer. The colors a re night and bright. I do want to mention that my lavender/purple cloth had a flaw or snag in it upon arrival. I still use it and it does not seem to be unraveling all the way just yet. The edges on these cloths are nice and thick and the cloths are a great size. I like using these and recommend them. *I was sent these as review samples, however this is my honest opinion."	&&&
All of my boys have had sensitive skin but these pampers wipes don't cause any problems for them. Thank you pampers for wonderful products.	&&&
I only use pamper wipes.	&&&
They are wipes	&&&
Works great. Stays standing, big enough, stays put, liquid-proof, easy to wipe clean on the inside, easy for the passenger to kick aside to make room if I ever have someone in the car with me, yet it doesn't slide around by itself. I use a grocery bag as a trash bag to line the inside so I can empty it easily. It's exactly the right size for a grocery bag liner, if that helps you figure out if it's the right size for you.	&&&
We go through a lot of these and they work well and last a long time.	&&&
Prompt shipping, great product.	&&&
Huggies are the BEST wipes! Nice and thick!	&&&
The costco bundle is a great deal for a free dispenser and the travel pouch. We actually bought two for daddy's diaper bag and for mine. Wipes are all purpose and we keep them in the car as well for us!	&&&
My wife hates this. Says they are slimy compared to the huggies we were using before. won't be buying again.	&&&
These wipes work great and are really fun for kids. Also a perk that they are flushable!	&&&
I use Babyganics for a couple of years but now I have a problem with these wipes and you cannot get a knowledgeable person on the phone at 'Babyganics'. One of my double pakcs contained a wipes container that turned moldy (black mold) within a day of opening it and using about two wipes. I did not use the other container from the same batch yet as it seems to look slighlty different from another batch that I have been using for a while now. They are for wiping down surfaces a baby comes in to contact with like a highchair and so on. You do not want mold anywhere! I'm disapointed and will write and update if the company decised to contact me.	&&&
Bought these based on a recommendation from a Co-worker. Gave them a shot, and now my husband has me buy them all the time. Totally worth it. The 'fresh scent' isn't overpowering or noticeable.	&&&
I got a free sample from somewhere and when I went to use it first on my phone, I was amazed. Then I tried it on the iPad and wow! No smudges and perfectly clear. So the big test came when I tried them in the plane. The gauges and radio panels had smudges for a long time and now, just a quick wipe and back to almost new! Highly recommend!	&&&
In an effort to increase profits ..... Kimberly-Clark has reduced the width\rof Cottonelle from FIVE inches to Three and seven eights inches.\rI'm sure this sleazy way of making more money has made your company\rvery happy. I am not happy at all. Narrow paper increases my chances\rof missing something, having stinky fingers, and having feces on the fingers.\r\r Your toilet paper is too narrow.	&&&
Great product	&&&
They wipes are really amazing. I've tried multiple sprays and wipes but nothing gets a lens as clean as quickly and easily as these wipes. Not the cheapest option on the market but well worth the price.	&&&
They really do leave a fresh scent! I love everything about Huggies brand! My baby smells good!	&&&
"These are very soft and nice quality bamboo washcloths. We use these only as cloth baby wipes (we also cloth diaper) in a wipes warmer with water, lavender essential oil, tea tree essential oil, manuka oil, rose water, jojoba oil, castor oil, rosehip oil, and fractionated coconut oil.

I would have preferred to be able to select colors (perhaps all one color) as the colors are fairly pastel light with a bright purple color in the mix (it is very pretty). I do worry about the lighter colors fading from frequent, daily washing, but so far they have not. The cloths are very soft even after washing several times. I have not had any fraying and these arrived without any flaws. The edges and stitching is precise and well done. I have dried them on low heat in the dryer twice, however, since they are used as wet wipes in our home, we now just take them from the washer and put into the freshly made diy wipes solution in the warmer. These wash up well, clean our baby's bottom and have not stained despite having some messy diaper changes. :) Nice wipes/cloths.

*I was sent the set of 8 at a promotional discounted rate, this is my honest opinion.)"	&&&
The Purell wipes come in three boxes: the "fragrance free" box, the "fresh citrus scent" box, and the "clean refereshing scent" box. Unlike the liquid Purell, these wipes are non-alcohol though they are based on a 0.13% solution of benzalkonium chloride. Besides just hands, these wipes can also be used on face, arms, and legs. I found all three boxes of wipes to be scented, even the "fragrance free" one. The experience of using these Purell wipes strongly reminded me of using Clorox wipes, even down to the similarity of the packaging and the wipes themselves. Though unlike Clorox, the Purell wipes were more pleasant and the scent was less stronger, in addition to their flexibility in terms of being able to use them on the body. I found these wipes are handy to have around and are comfortable to use.	&&&
I love how thick these wipes are! I find myself able to use less wipes per messy diapers vs the store brand because these are thicker and more efficient at cleaning a messy bottom!	&&&
great stickable product	&&&
"These are Naturally Natures Bamboo Baby Washcloths.
They are very nicely made and so very soft, will feel so good
for baby`s skin. These would be great for anyone to use as
well, really nice to wash your face with at the end of the day.
These come in a nice presentation, there are 6 washcloths
in the set, they are nice large 10 x 10 cloths and the colors
are 2 yellow, two white and 2 green, they are very light
colors. Each is rolled and wrapped with a ribbon.
They are ready for gift giving, great for a baby shower or to
welcome baby home gift.
I received a promotional launching discount in exchange
for my honest and unbiase opinion."	&&&
I got these to try a new wipe. They were a good price. Boy are they thin. I am not happy with them at all, you can see right through them. I'll stick with the pampers sensitives.	&&&
good clean up wipes. Will work well if you ride a bike to school or work.	&&&
I really like the texture of these wipes. I felt like they hold moisture great.	&&&
Super Soft and bigger than your average baby wash clothes. Very nice quality and comes wrapped individually with a ribbon. Excellent quality I might add. They are considered organic which a lot of people are looking for. If you are one of them then this is what you need. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	&&&
My daughter has extremely sensitive skin, these wipes work great for her. the clean smell is also a plus!!!	&&&
I really like the wipes. They seem to be more moist and softer than other brands I have used.	&&&
I've had no problems with using these wipes. These don't tear real easy, but they also aren't extra thick. They are a great deal considering the quantity of wipes you get.	&&&
Greaat wipes. Will leave you fresh. Does not irritate and does the work meanwhile respecting your normal flora!	&&&
Smell terrible. Cleans horribly.	&&&
Dislike walking around with colorful hands every time I use this product."}},	&&&
Great product.	&&&
"PROS
+ Soft & stretchable
+ Gets into the nooks & cranny's

CONS
- OVERPRICED. You can find similar organic wash cloth wipes for half the cost
- Depending on what one is looking for in a wash cloth, these may by too thin if you're looking for a more plush cloth wipe"	&&&
Small towel but it has safe ingredients, so that's good to me	&&&
These are great! They work in preventing a sore nose when kids have colds and are constantly wiping it. It's also really nice that they come in sensitive for those that can't do scented. The scented smell great though! My kids love them!	&&&
I always used pampers wipes in the past. I figured I would try these. They are fantastic. I will not be buying the name brands again	&&&
I love Huggies brand wipes. They are great for babies, adults and any one in between. I started buying them for my daughter when she was a baby and we still use them 5 years later for anything that needs a quick clean.	&&&
"Got all the handi wipes I need for a long time

Comes in a few boxes - each with 24 individual packets of Wet Ones.

Great!"	&&&
I love the Simple Wipes! They are beyond awesome. The exfoliating wipes are just a little bit better than the regular cleansing wipes because they give a little added exfoliation that helps the cleanser get deep down into your pores. It wisks away all dirt and debris with ease. There is never a shortage of cleanser on each wipe and the individual wipes are the perfect size for your whole face. These have never hurt my skin or caused any scratches, redness, or irritation. I have never had a problem pulling out more than one wipe at a time either. Until the last wipe the package stays moist. I use these more than once a day and have never had problems with irritation. I also like how there are few ingredients so this makes the brand trusted even more. I love these and recommend that your skin will too!	&&&
I admit to using these things on almost anything! They are great for cleaning surfaces and for quick wipe-downs in places like the kitchen. I also love using them for wiping down door handles as well.	&&&
Best wipes for delicate skin	&&&
Great wipes, great price!	&&&
As you probably already know cats HATE water so these are greeeat when you don't want to battle the cat. They clean and deodorize fabulously!!! A MUST TRY!!!	&&&
These wipes were good to use when my baby's bottom was red/ rashed, and they didn't irritate her as much as other brands. I like the wipes, but the scent they leave on hands could be improved. They get my baby's bottom cleaned up nicely, and they're also good on runny noses.	&&&
These are the best wipes I've purchased by far. My son has very sensitive skin, so we need to buy fragrance-free wipes. These are thick and durable. I like that the cleansers are plant-based as well.	&&&
These wipes are soft & clean nicely. Baby was sensitive to others [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
This thing works great! I realized that mopping can just spread the dirt and grime in rather than extract it like this machine does. I am very satisfied with the purchase.	&&&
Great wipes.	&&&
Since my baby always has his little hands in his mouth and they tend to always get dirty I like to wipe them off with these wipes if we are out	&&&
These wipers were perfect. They got the stickiest of messes off my baby's bottom with the gentlest of touches.	&&&
My husband recently passed away and when he was alive - and now - I couldn't buy or use anything but Cottonelle Ultra. One time I bought a cheaper brand and he was very upset because he and I both liked the Ultra brand. I still only buy Cottonelle because it is thick, soft and just the best for me.	&&&
"Really can't find anything negative to say about these, other than the usual complaint about wipes, which is sometimes you get more than one with a pull, and sometimes the wipe falls in and you have to open the whole tub to restart it! I have never found any wipe that has solved these issues.
These have just enough wetness to get a good clean without being sopping wet. There is no special texture, but they wipe poopy messes up quite easily.
I sometimes buy the sensitive or fragrance free when the price on those is better, but my kids don't have sensitive skin, so I find the scented ones to be just fine for our use."	&&&
These work great for stubborn dust (like cat litter dust) that seems to just push around but never gets picked up. These are slightly tacky and are similar to dryer sheets. They can be used several times before throwing away. I use mine on many surfaces in my home including my entertainment center, washer & dryer, kitchen tables, coffee tables and more. They leave no residue and work great on cat hair and dust.	&&&
"VERY small individual sheets. They also don't come out of the top easily, so you have to open the cap again every time you want a new one.

Tried this new, cheaper brand, but I definitely recommend seventh generation wipes instead!"	&&&
Love pampers sensitive wipes. So moist and gentle on little ones.	&&&
Does a great job of cleaning and disinfecting on multiple surfaces and does not leave any residue after. I am glad that I was able to locate and find this natural alternative to the other clean-disinfecting wipes which could have harmful chemicals in them. I have added them to my monthly subscribe & save list.	&&&
For my baby shower I have alot of great things about pampers' products; so i requested them on my registry thinking as a brand new mom I would give them a try. Well, it turns out they have exceeded my expectations and I have tried other brands to be fair, but nothing worked for me like pampers wipes. They a very sturdy and stay nice and moist in the package and even in my wipe warmer!	&&&
Best deal out there. Amazon will not allow me to say which store it beats in comparison of prices, but let's just say it's the big sprawling one originally from Arkansas, known for it's low prices. Buy here. These wipes get pretty much all the little dirt spots off of surfaces. I use them mostly for dusting, but also on counters and for lifting grease spots off of my range top. Gets some dirt and stains off of the white rubber sole of shoes, but not all. Still great for quick, easy spot cleaning. I have a lot of dirt spots to manage so these are super convenient.	&&&
I like the wipes, but dislike the packaging. The package does not stay closed after a couple of times of opening & closing it.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. They are very thick, moist, and soft. They have a very nice and light scent. They're extremely gentle on my son's sensitive skin and have never broken him out. Yet they always clean up even the dirtiest jobs with just one cloth (occasionally two). They are a little pricier than other wipes, so there is less bang for your buck. Regardless, I highly recommend this product!	&&&
"As a grandmother you always want softness next to the baby’s skin. These are great washcloths and they neutral colors so these can be used on either boys or girls.

To me presentation is everything and then the product is next and the Naturally Nature washcloths are present to you in a beautiful package with each wrapped in a black and white pokey dot ribbon. The size of the Bamboo Baby washcloths is standard. These can be used on babies who have skin problems or not.

Naturally Nature gave me these Naturally Nature Bamboo Baby Washcloths at a discounted price for a fair and honest review of the product."	&&&
Nightly makeup removal . Convenient for home or travel.	&&&
"Best wipe that I've found so far. No extra particulates on the lenses after cleaning, no streaking and not ""over"" moistened so they dont have to be dried off afterward which kind of defeats the purpose.

Bought two boxes again. Next time I need them, I'll be coming back to these again.

Probably my 8th set of boxes of the wipes. Does a good job cleaning your phone off afterward too."	&&&
My dad really loves these. He uses them to remove grease, paint and other yucky stuff dads get on their hands. He likes them so much, I ordered him a case!	&&&
I tried these for cleaning around my stoma prior to a shower and a then placing a new skin barrier and ostomy bag on my abdomen. They do the job nicely. I was concerned about the alcohol content, but it is a minor ingredient. The price was excellent compared to buying the wipes from suppliers like Edgepark, even with insurance.	&&&
My puppy hates baths, and puts up quite a fight in the tub, so these have been very helpful in keeping him clean without all the hassle. He seems to really enjoy getting cleaned with these, and they do a good job!	&&&
My counters feel cleaner.i have cats the lysol disinfectants are a must for me..	&&&
I have had and seen other brands of wipes that clean pacifiers. And this one does the job just fine! It's the cheapest and most one I have seen! Including I love their pacifiers!! So cute!	&&&
These arrived on time. I like that they have some ready to go packs for the diaper bag and regular refills for home and anything else you need.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes for my son. the are gentle and clean well. they also smell so fresh :)	&&&
So soft, yet so durable. Loved the ripples for added effectiveness. Being flushable is also a huge plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love a good facial cleansing wipe and Simple did a great job with theirs. I found it to be as efficient as any other wipe, but the knowledge behind the product makes me like it more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Handy to have for wiping off all the little toys that go in my teething baby's mouth. Keep in diaper bag so you have them handy	&&&
"They work great. Removes all finger prints. Screen looks like new after use."	&&&
"Does not do its job,all the more dehydrated my wipes completely which are mere tissue papers now.
Loss of your money.i have already opened the pack and tried different methods to keep my wipes warm but it has nit helped.as a result cannot return it."	&&&
"I have perused a lot of reviews and tried several other personal wipes, and these Wet Ones are my favorite. However, I do miss the Wet Ones singles that are no longer available, or I should say I used to miss them.

I use these wipes for their intended purpose, but I also use them for instances where there are no showers or running water while traveling or cycling to keep clean. Thanks to the large size and wetness of the sheets you can wipe down your body to feel clean. When traveling I store wipes in one quart freezer bags rather than transport the whole tub.

The sheets can also be teared into two or more segments (they can only be teared in one direction) to use for smaller tasks, or if you are concerned about clogging your plumbing with the large sheets.

For daily use I store 2 to 3 sheets in 2.5"" X 3"" 4mil Clear Reclosable Resealable Poly Zipper Bags, that I purchased on amazon.com from uGems and put it in my pocket. As it turns out, this is a better solution for me than having the Wet Ones single packets. Since there is no labeling, when one accidentally falls out, I can say they are just hand wipes that I keep handy. Also the zipper eliminates the tearing noise you get with a sealed packet, to make use less noticeable."	&&&
"My son had a runny nose and regular tissue had irritated his nose but boogie wipes really helped sooth his nose when I wiped it."	&&&
"Even though we have no babies around here except when the old man drools there are lots of reasons for the joy from Seventh Generation Thick & Soft Baby Wipes. They do not have any dyes, fragrances, parabens or phthalates. Even though I had no idea what the last two meant I can say now without equivocation I am so glad I took the time to learn their meaning because it is indeed wonderful to know they are NOT in the product. Furthermore, a hypoallergenic parameter is significant since we often have allergenic reactions from something. We even made a point to be sure our last dog purchase included that parameter. I guess that explains why she struts around snorting ""I'm hypoallergenic and you are not.""

Each package contains 64 wipes. My first reaction after opening the package was the generally thicker wipe and a noticeable absence of any odors on the adequately moistened wipe. I would have preferred a flushable wipe; however, these are not of that nature, so it is just a word of caution, especially if there is a septic tank in the yard.

Right now, we have been using them to clean the faces of the dogs and even the humans when a quick, moist wipe is needed. Come warmer weather one has already earned a seat on the lawnmower to provide a modicum of refreshment while mowing. At the end of weed eating one or two will be ready to provide similar refreshment. While there are no babies we have a house full of wipe users and often especially since these were introduced. To be perfectly clear, we really like them a lot."	&&&
My baby is turning 6 months next week and I just placed my 4th order of these disposable dry wipes. I have been using these wipes to clean my baby during diaper changes and he has never had any diaper rash. If occasionally I notice some redness in the diaper area then I just apply a bit of Balmex and the redness is gone by next diaper change. We use these wipes by cutting them in four parts (as they are pretty large) and just moisten a wipe in warm water in a bowl and cleanse baby that way. I have used these wipes 99% of the time while at home and have only used the regular baby wipes when out with baby. I love these wipes and will continue to use them for as long as my baby is in diapers. My husband and I decided that for future baby #2 we'll take these wipes to the hospital, change our future newborn from first diaper change, and forbid the nurses to use regular baby wipes on future newborn's sensitive skin, especially now that we remember how rough they were cleaning our firstborn's bottom and we, as new parents, had no clue!	&&&
I keep them in my travel case for shining up my silver jewelry on the go. They work fantastic. Yes, I get black oxidation on my hands, but it easily washes off. I use every available bit of space on my wipes front and back. They make my silver look gorgeous.	&&&
I love these make up removing wipes! The cloth is large enough to remove face & eye makeup and leaves your face feeling refreshed. I would definitely recommend them. The only dislike is that the package does not stay sealed once it's opened. You have to make sure you have a good seal otherwise, the towels tend to dry out. I've had to use tape to reseal the package which is not to my satisfaction.	&&&
Very easy to use. My Papillon loves the taste and are just the right size for her tiny mouth. Keeps her teeth nice and clean and we don't have to spend a fortune to have her teeth clean as often. Would highly recommend.	&&&
I highly recommend these wipes. Great buy and price	&&&
These do not clean well. They may disinfect, but as I do not regularly take samples from my home surfaces for evaluation I cannot say whether they disinfect. I feel that for the effectiveness vs. the environmental impact and cost these Clorox wipes are not a good product. I would not buy them again. However, they do have a very pleasant smell which is why I gave them a D.	&&&
These really are made in China! Wow poor decision will never buy again. Burts Bee still a US product.	&&&
These wipes are great around the office. The only thing I don't like the smell. They kinda remind me of a nursing home... They do work though	&&&
I LOVE THESE ! ! My son will not let us suck his nose when he is really runny or stopped up but these work wonders. We live by these boogie wips	&&&
What can I really say about this....it's canned air and screen wipes. They work, simple as that	&&&
I love these wipes! We always buy the 3 pack at walmart, and they last forever. It's a great way to clean up the kitchen without destroying your hands with bleach.	&&&
My children have very sensitive skin for the first few years of their lives. I was so happy to find these wipes with our newest addition. I don't have to worry about him breaking out in contact dermatitis from the ingredients in this wipe.	&&&
I love these make up wipes. They take off all of my make up without making my skin feel dry and taut. They even remove eye make up without irritating my eyes. After using these wipes my face actually feels clean. I will definitely be purchasing these again.	&&&
I love the sensitive baby wipes they are so gentle on the skin, I have used these on my daughter since she was born and now she is 22 months old and has never had a diaper rash.	&&&
"Compact
Light weight
Keeps wipes moist"	&&&
"Like so many other reviewers, I too am apparently allergic to the chemicals in these things, even though I have never had sensitive skin and I am allergic to hardly anything at all. I mean, I can pretty much roll around in poison oak or poison ivy and not react at all! But these…! If you happen to die and be unfortunate enough to have to go to hell, this is what I imagine the devil gives you to wipe your bottom.

I normally purchase the cheap three pack Equate brand from Walmart (no issues at all with those) but since I was out and not at Walmart I purchased these. Big, big mistake! It took me a while to realize that these were the source of my irritation, I seriously thought I had some kind of infection down there. I had already made an appointment to see my gyno but that was a week out and I was suffering so much! Thankfully, after a few days I started noticing the cause-and-effect relationship, things would settle down down there a bit but then I would use these again and suddenly huge flareup. Once I stopped using them the problem resolved and I was able to cancel my doctors appointment. That happened about six months ago and I have since been using the Walmart brand and have never had a problem.

I only went online searching to see how common this was because yesterday one of my friends went to the urgent care for the same reason and they suggested it might be the wipes, which had not occurred to her since she had been using them for a few months with no problem until now. When she told me today what had happened I let her know the same thing had happened to me. She is super mad because she's out a $75 co-pay as well as had to submit to an embarrassing examination and is now finding out that this is a known common issue with these wipes."	&&&
This FloorMate does a great job vacuuming and washing. The dry function is just ok. It's heavier than I expected so be prepared for a bit of a workout if you are doing a large area. I know the floors are clean because the "dirty" tank is always shocking at how dirty it is. However, it doesn't leave my hardwood floors shining.	&&&
I love love love these wipes! You can use them on everything and they make my house smell so clean!	&&&
Excellent wipes. Never have to worry about leaving anything behind!	&&&
Not only can it be used as a baby wipe but also as a makeup remover! These wipes are great! Definitely recommend .	&&&
on time, plentiful, they work very happy	&&&
I have one in my car, in my bathroom, in my kitchen, in my bedroom, and a spare! You can say that I use these a lot. :)	&&&
Great for everyday clean up. Great to have for at home, office and even your car!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes for absolutely everything. They are so easy to use and clean up really well and quickly!	&&&
We love these wipes. They are so soft, and are smooth to use. I've used other wipes in the past that seem to stick on contact, and it makes it hard to actually wipe the baby. These are wonderful.	&&&
Need it to clean my house	&&&
We've used these wipes for years and this last box we bought, SMELLS SO BADLY. When using them on hands or faces the smell lingers. They've left a rash on my daughters bottom and we've had to stop using them. I compared the label to the last box and it seems some of the ingredients have changed. So completely disappointed to have to find something new.	&&&
My most favorite brand. Sent these as a gift.	&&&
best product at a reasonable price	&&&
My husband loves this product, especially when traveling. Make a great stocking stuffer.	&&&
My poor husband is allergic to fragrances and every wipe he used was causing allergy attacks. Even the "allergen free" ones, which often had something in it (like chamomile). These not only allow him to change her diaper (much easier on me!), but we feel so good about the minimal ingredients.	&&&
My kids are a little older, but still use this product for quick cleanups. Love this product	&&&
These clean the best and are the only thing my son can even have. He breaks out badly from anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for my daughter for a while and it gets the job done. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I've used a variety of wipes already, from name brand to pampers sensitive wipes. And along with the overall scent and softness of Pampers Sensitive Baby Wipes, I would rate the cleanliness of my baby's bottom a 9/10!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Both products increased the pleasure of using my laptop. I even used the wipes on my Insignia t.v.	&&&
These wipes are the best wipes i have ever purchased. They are now the only ones i will be purchasing!	&&&
I loved the pampers wipes, and the price is excellent!	&&&
"My daughter has sensitive skin, so we have to be careful with which wipes we purchase for her. She hasnt had a negative reaction from these, which we were stoked about since they are also a good value compared to store pricing for the same product. Prices vary here on Amazon from day to day at times, so I wont go into specifics, but the subscribe and save pricing coupled with the Amazon Mom's program discount ends up saving me around $4 for the same amount of wipes from an off brand sold at our local grocer/wal mart/etc....
Anyway, the wipes work as they are supposed to, and I've found I need to use less when there is a disaster than when I use other brands of wipes such as Comforts for example. They also dont have the weird, alcohol-ish smell that some wipes carry. An overall good product."	&&&
I switched to these gentle wipes to help solve a rough case of diaper rash on my 2 month old. They did an excellent job. I also noticed that they are less harsh on my hands too!	&&&
I have been using these on my son since we brought him home from the hospital. I love them. They smell great and they are thick enough that they don't get holes while you are cleaning up poop which I have had happen with other brands in the past. My son is 6 months old and has never had a diaper rash. He has very sensitive skin on the rest of his body and has eczema but nothing has appeared in his diaper area. The only thing I don't like is the packaging, but I ahve the same issue with most wipes containers...I wish they would close more easily.	&&&
These are great to have on hand and don't take up any space in a handbag. They get the lenses sparkling clean and dry almost instantly. I wouldn't buy any other brand.	&&&
I have used these and really love the quantity in the box. I also like that it is fragrance free	&&&
They do the job as expected. They are thicker than those used in the past which makes for a softer feel.	&&&
These wipes are so easy to use and gets the job done fast. Great for travel!	&&&
So, I use these personally and not for babies, and they are fabulous (also as an eye makeup remover). The only thing I get annoyed with is the packaging. At times when you are pulling out a wipe, you get 4-5 and then putting them back is problematic. That is the only thing that is dropping them a star. If you have a leftover wipe container from another brand that you can refill with these, I would recommend that.	&&&
This wipe has been working great for my baby, no reaction at all. It is kind of thin and sometimes I feel some of the sheets are dryer than they should be. But overall it works well.	&&&
Great way to clean up runny nose! Not abrasive and perfect for my baby's very sensitive skin. I prefer the regular packaging with the flip top which was easier to use. I wish the value pack had those too.	&&&
These are excellent wipes and I use them one or two times a day, after dry toilet paper, for more thorough cleaning . However, they have three questionable ingredients that, if replaced, would make this a far more desireable product. They are: Methylparaben, Propylene Glycol, and Propylparaben. They use an excellent, flushable, non-woven fabric that is very soft. Sometimes the folding process of each wipe is not accurate, making the wipes difficult to remove, one at a time. Despite these 3 hazardous chemicals, I still use these daily, but I'm looking out for a safer formulated, product.	&&&
These wipes are much larger than I was expecting. I didn't notice a big difference between using these and baby wipes, but I was testing these at an outdoor music festival. They did the job and smelled decent. It's nice that they come in individual packages to throw one in a bag, rather than an entire pouch or container.	&&&
I love Huggies Baby Wipes! They are so thick, strong, and soft. This is a great bargain, delivered to my door and enough for me to give my daughter some for the grandchildren and also have some left for me. Thank you for this item 	&&&
Ok product very convenient	&&&
I have been faithful to these wipes for over a year now, but recently the quality has completely diminished. They are so thin, you have to be careful not to rip it when you take it out of the package and they are almost translucent, it feels like I'm wiping my makeup off with my hand and I have makeup all over the palm of my hand when I'm done. This was never a problem until last month. Please stop cutting corners with these wipes. It wasn't broken, so there was no need to fix it :(	&&&
Love these wipes! They are great for travel and on the go cleaning. They get rid of all the grime/film on my rings from lotion and soap etc. I use them on my ring once a week or so and also give them as engagements/hostess gifts. They work quickly, are easy to use and do their job. Much simpler than having to dunk my jewelry in a jar of jewelry cleaner. Such a cute and useful product!	&&&
"These baby washcloths are so very soft. My 4 year old son has severe eczema and is very sensitive to anything that will scratch his skin. These washcloths are perfect for using for his baths. They come so cute wrapped individually with a perfect little ribbon. So dainty! Any new mother would absolutely love too! Many uses for these. Toddlers and babies can use. Even I would use they are so soft.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion."	&&&
Free exchange 4 review. I love this product. These washclothes are so soft. They are so nice to use on both of the kids. I would definitely by these n the future. If you purchase these you will not be disapointed.	&&&
This wipes warmer was a blessing! It worked better than I expected. The instructions had warned not to leave it plugged in to insure a longer product usage life span. We still leave it plugged in 24/7 and it works amazing. Love the size and weight and colors. My daughter loves the glow of the dispenser button. Go figure! I recommend this for parents on a budget with children who are finicky and get distracted during changing time.	&&&
These wipes are only good if used within 4 weeks of opening.... And there's an expiration date ... Make sure u check it bc it's short .... Still a good wipe tho	&&&
These are life savers for when you are out and about. My wife carries them in her purse and we use them to wipe down whatever is in our way! Beware germs, here we come!	&&&
I have used these on my son when he had a rash. This product works so great. I definitely recommend Huggies Natural Care to anyone who has a child with a sensitive tushie!	&&&
'''Did not like these at all. These were cheaper than the ones my eye Dr. gave me which are very expensive. I thought it would be worth a try as they are cheaper but they aren't the same quality. Will not order them again.	&&&
Pricey but I love them! I wear contacts. They are so soft and non-oily, remove waterproof mascara easily. I'm a forever fan.	&&&
Great product.	&&&
Really good in hot humid weather use with infusion sets for Insulin pump thanks good product	&&&
This is perfect for storing my clothe wipes!	&&&
Amazing product! Love the smell very general on the hands great for my lilt one that has many allergies I use them to wipe down carriages in stores before I use them! Also great for when the kids are sick..	&&&
I keep one in the kitchen and one in each bathroom for really keeping things clean! I order this product about every 3 months or more often when needed. Nice to have them handy and makes me clean lots more often!	&&&
My family has enjoyed using this product. I was mystified as to why it is no longer available as a product choice in the store. It can be very frustrating when you need the product and it is not available to you immediately.	&&&
These work really well in our wipe warmer.	&&&
I love how soft these wipes are but they just tear right out of the dispenser. I chose this brand because they are more economical but I won't buy them again.	&&&
GREAT DEAL	&&&
smaller than costco size,	&&&
So thick, they make messes only take seconds to clean.	&&&
Not moist enough	&&&
I love their texture and the perfect amount of moisture. They are strong and I don't need as many for big, messy jobs.	&&&
I didn't like these wipes at all! they seemed to tear way to easy. yuck.	&&&
I love these wipes. They seems to be the only thing that can truly leave my appliances with a no streak look. These wipes are not great at cleaning a mess off of the appliance, such as a spill of gravy, but they are perfect for the finishing touch. For a big spill, I use a regular sponge or Clorox wipe. Once the mess is gone from the surface, I'll finish up with a stainless steel wipe and the surface shines.	&&&
These are great lens wipes. I use them on everything!	&&&
"These work great"	&&&
Works great.	&&&
These wipes really are fresh smelling, as well as gentle on my children's skin. They don't smell like medicine or chemicals. They can also be used for cleaning up the kids hands, mouth , or any mess made.	&&&
Lysol is always good	&&&
I bought this pack for my car, it helps me keep this inside really clean. I also use it for my bathroom.	&&&
We used these with our son from the first week home until we ran out. We then switched to regular Pampers wipes with no issues. Soft, sensitive, and great value. Very pleased with the purchase.	&&&
They smelled horrible. They gave my daughter a rash, She has never had a rash. I was trying these just to try them. We use cloth diapers and she has not ever had a rash before these diapers. I am thinking these wipes are very closely compared to wet hand wipes that are from buffalo wild wings. That is what they feel like. I am not sure how they could be the #1 in baby wipes. They were way over priced. I found them at walgreens and they were on of the cheapest brands to buy. I have always ordered Earths best baby wipes, I will stick to them from now on. I will never use clearly herbal again. Do not waste your money on these cheap wipes that you can buy anywhere. Way over priced!!!!!!!!	&&&
These are just OK. They work fine but I probably won't repurchase. I prefer a wipe with a little more moisture. I also prefer a light scent over the unscented.	&&&
"I bought these to use in addition to my LO's toothbrush. LO actually uses an adult EXTRA gentle Arm & Hammer Spinbrush. Our LO has a toothbrush like ours but we only have to dispose of the brush heads.
Kids battery/ spin toothbrushes die & you throw the entire thing away.

Wipes are used at night only so that Xylitol is in the mouth at night working.

LO sometimes bites, likes to suck the wipe, & will allow minimal time to wipe teeth similar to other parents' experiences.

I have research the ingredients. Listed as the 5th ingredient in these wipes is Sodium Benzoate, which MIGHT cause cancer; a site says it kills healthy cells.
Sodium Benzoate is ranked by EWG as a 3-- w w w . ewg . org / skindeep / ingredient/ 705989 / SODIUM_BENZOATE /

w w w. naturalnews .com / sodium_benzoate . html

Hydroxyethylcellulose has petroleum derivatives according to a competitor's website.

After doing research I will use the competitors -tooth tissue-even though it has Potassium Sorbate which is listed as the very last ingredient. The competitor is also using bamboo to make the wipe itself w/o bleaching so it is off wipe color.

I have no idea how the Spiffies wipe itself is made? It is very white so I am concerned about bleach products might be used to make the wipe bright white & still being in the wipe."	&&&
This is a product used by my husband and it was available through Medicare but is no longer available on assignment from Medicare and my husband found it available through amazon	&&&
I really enjoy huggies wipes. They are moistened just right and they never break out my little one.	&&&
My grandson was having a hard time getting rid of a rash. It turned out to be a yeast rash. After it was mostly cleared up, he couldn't tolerate the usual wipes. I picked up a package of Huggies Natural Care wipes and it was a hit! Now he doesn't wiggle to get away when during cleanup and diapering is a good experience again.	&&&
Clean is happy.	&&&
"Before, I would've given these a 5, hands down. The cloths are soft and no weird smells, just mild and clean. We've been using them for several years now and I'm not sure if the formula has changed but first, with me, and then more recently with my daughter we have noticed it causes skin irritation. It appears red and blotchy wherever the wipe had come in contact, particularly in the cheeks. We usually use these to wipe our daughter's runny/stuffy nose or messy face after a meal, but because of the resulting rash we don't use it anymore.
Like I said, we've been using these for a couple years and only recently have we had any problems. Perhaps the last 3 packs have been flukes? Or maybe environmental changes have made thus incompatible for us? Or the recipe has simply changed a bit. Just in case, I just thought I'll put this info out there in case anybody us wondering."	&&&
"Terrific, well made product and our dog loves wearing these.
We don't worry about little mistakes on the carpet anymore."	&&&
For the price and the size of the containers, this was a good deal. I ordered this with Subscribe and Save and so that made it more cost efficient. As far as cleaning, I love these things for cleaning things like countertops and tables.	&&&
it works like a charm just a wipe	&&&
I use Huggies Natural Care wipes for my newborn, he has very sensitive skin and natural care wipes have worked great! No break outs or rashes! Thank you Huggies!	&&&
I love the smell of these as well as the convenience. I keep one in the bathroom(s), one in the kitchen, and one in the laundry room. In the upcoming flu season, these will be invaluable for keeping the virus at bay, along with hand washing and covering your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze.	&&&
These were the best wipes I had come across and the only ones I've been buying for over a year, but the last case we bought was "updated" with new packing material and STINKY, AWFUL smell! Obviously the manufacturer changed not only the packaging but the formula for the wipes as well, but it's sooooooo bad!!! We hate these new wipes due to bad stinky smell and have been forced to go out and try to find something else. Bring back the old formula please with no scent!!!	&&&
Great product. Great price. Thank you Amazon subscribe & save and coupons!!	&&&
I love these kind of baby wipes out if them all cause they have no perfume scents. My daughter is 19 months and because of these pa er sensitive wipes haven't had any issues at all thank you pamoers	&&&
I was given this product to review and many times in too lazy to remove my makeup and these work great with better ingredients	&&&
For my babies sensitive skin i use pampers sensitive wipes. job well done PAMPERS...	&&&
This is a great wipe warmer solution if your changing table topper is limited on space. However, since the design is vertical it will stick out with your nursery decor - why Dex Baby gave no thought to the color of the plastic is crazy to me. The picture features it in pastel yellow but it's an outdated picture. It's a hideous dark green color - one that no nursery, boy or girl, would ever be decorated in. So you'll have a lovely pink, blue, grey, etc nursery then all the sudden this hideous green plastic thing popping out at you. Some may not care but just a heads up if you're in to the design of the room.	&&&
I was so excited to try these wipes because I heard lots of good things about them but was disappointed to find out that after a week or so they acquired a funky smell. So I opened up a new pack and saw that they had mold on them! I was so disgusted. I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.	&&&
These are great, love having individual wipes in bulk to use on the run. I use them primarily to clean my phone screen, but my girlfriend also uses them for her glasses. We both are very happy with them.	&&&
Great dust wipes for picture and painting frames.	&&&
"My friend just got a first grand child and I ordered quite a few organic items by Naturally Natures. The items made from bamboo and are exceptional quality. I ordered her a mattress top, some bibs and those washcloths.
She gave all these items to her daughter and both ladies are happy. The washcloths are so soft and don't irritate baby's skin. They go through washer nicely without any stains and stay soft. I highly recommend those product made of bamboo. I have received this item with a discount to express my personal opinion. Great product."	&&&
Great wipes	&&&
These are the best wipes ever created! I get far less baby poo on my fingers with these!	&&&
"I have had and seen other brands of wipes that clean pacifiers. And this one does the job just fine! It's the cheapest and most one I have seen! Including I love their pacifiers!! So cute!"	&&&
Great for travel and also at home. They're individually packaged and pre-moistened and the makeup remover is already on the wipe. Its so convenient and the wipes don't hurt. Its very gentle. I especially love these because its very effective on my water-resistant eyeliner. Its the only thing thats worked for me. Tough on makeup, easy on skin. Not messy. Really just perfect.	&&&
I give a four as these to me are like the ones for everyone and thus why put woman on the package,	&&&
I love these. I have sensitive skin and they work really well for me. They are safe for the eyes but if you have on a ton of makeup or waterproof you will need to hold this over your eye for like 15 seconds before wiping if you want to avoid the need to scrub at your eyes. I love these for washing my face on the the go, they are my favorite overall wipes. I will say however if I am going to be wearing waterproof eye makeup Tarte's brand wipes are better for that (but they are super greasy so not good for the whole face). If I had to pick one wipe for the rest of my life it would be this one. EXTRA BONUS: They are biodegradable and they smell great.	&&&
These wipes make dusting and cleaning so easy. I love them and will order more when the time comes.	&&&
these are very good cleaning and disinfecting wipes with a great lemon smell.. I love using these wipes..	&&&
"Maybe it's just me but every sanitizing wipe I have tried has always felt sticky on my hands...to the point that I haven't tried them on my face at all. These Purell wipes seem to have broken the curse for me. I used the unscented wipes (I don't do scents) and didn't feel sticky at all...and subsequently tried one on my face quickly in case and was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn't have any sticky residue or reaction to the wipe at all. It cleaned well and after then using it on my hands I could easily dispose of it.

I'm sold and will now purchase the pack about once a month. The other members of the family aren't as finicky as I and they prefer scented products and will get a choice of two 'clean scent' and 'citrus' both of which don't have an over powering odor and do smell fresh and clean.

I give them five stars because they do what they say they do and without any sticky chemical feel."	&&&
I've been using these makeup remover wipes for over a year now. The last box I bought has been a great disappointment. The cloths are thick and soft; however, they're barely damp now. I don't need them to be dripping, but the wetness has definitely changed.	&&&
This is a very good buy for the price. I have a little two year old at home and one on the way and these will last me for awhile.	&&&
I actually use these as make-up removers! They are gentle and soft enough for my face, and don't leave behind any residue. I love them, and they're way less expensive than buying true make-up remover cloths!	&&&
Cleans my ipad and makes it look just so amazing!!!!!!!!!	&&&
I've put some wipes in this box and left them alone for a bit, but seems the box doesn't close very tightly around the edges, so after some time (less than what i'd consider reasonable), the wipes will tend to dry out. beware and don't over stuff!	&&&
I've used these for years, wanted to buy quanitity. Also I'm have a septic tank for waste so wanted the flushable wipes.	&&&
I don't think Clorox pushes this product enough! I keep a container in almost every room of the house. Makes it so easy to keep a clean, healthy, sweet smelling home. Along with obvious kitchen and bath surfaces, I run a cloth over woodwork, picture frames, door knobs - virtually every surface in my house! So quick, so easy, Get the word out there!!!!	&&&
We have a lot of smell-sensitive people in our office, and this is the only product that pleases everyone!	&&&
"A fairly recent study concluded that baby wipes can cause skin irritations that may be mistaken for dermatitis or eczema. The additive that was determined to cause a majority of the reactions is methylisothiazolinone. I went hunting for a wipe without this additive, and this wipe came across the radar. The package doesn't really get into detail about excluded additives other than alcohol and fragrances, so I went and did some research. It turns out this wipe still contains methylisothiazolinone.

Stay tuned for a wipe that is methylisothiazolinone free. With all the hubbub on the topic recently, you can bet most of the big names will produce a more hypoallergenic wipe than those that exist now.

The wipe is still better than the alternatives, being fragrance and alcohol free. The fragrances are an unknown in terms of additives, and are a luxury. Alcohol cleans well, but it dries out skin and tends to kill cells (bad if your baby is healing from a rash). Also, I noticed these are quite a bit more expensive than the standard wipes.

Good luck."	&&&
would have been 5 stars, I wish there were more per container	&&&
I love using make up removing cleansing wipes and these are very good. They smell really light & fresh and they do a nice job cleaning. Overall this package is a good value. The cleansing wipes at Sephora, for one package they price them at $12, so you are getting a good deal from QVC. The only reason I am giving 4 stars versus 5 is because I think the wipes are on the thin side & small side. If they were like Neutrogena's make up wipes (size and thickness), than I would give them 5 stars.	&&&
I thought this would be easier than the spray and wipe method however when you go to pull out one, more than one comes out. The towels are very moist so I needed to go over it with a towel any way. I went back to the Sprayway in a can. Sprayway product itself it great, just the wipes are more wasteful than helpful.	&&&
If it were battery it would be better. It's only warm when it's plugged in. Defeats the purpose of being portable if it's not warm.	&&&
It does clean very thoroughly, BUT! It leaves horrible marks on lenses afterwards when the chemical liquid is dried, which means you have to use something else to clean it again! I once used a similar product that does not leave anything unnecessary after cleaning, but I can't recall its brand name :(	&&&
There are plenty of other baby wipes that have a far more soft and gentler feel. These are rather thick, which makes them more rough to deal with. Additionally, these things are almost impossible to take out of the pack without an additional 1 or 2 more wipes coming with them. The wife commented that this is perhaps a conspiracy by the baby wipe industry to get us to buy more which I find humorous but can't discount entirely. I think we'll be sticking with other baby wipes that aren't as rough like pampers even though we prefer to not support large businesses like that.	&&&
I use wipes for EVERYTHING. This looks nicer than the plastic box that comes with the wipes and makes getting a wipe easy.	&&&
Quite possible the worst smelling household product I have ever used. Will NEVER buy this product again!"}},	&&&
i love using anything that clorox makes because it brightens and cleans just like it is supposed to. I do not and will not use any other product. Please continue to make this product. Thanks	&&&
I started out loving these wipes when my daughter was born because I was a 1st time mom and knew nothing about wipes. I also had a large pack of Huggies One and Done wipes I received as a shower gift, and used them after I ran out of Pampers wipes. After feeling the thickness of the Huggies, these ones are very thin and you have to use about 4-5 for a #2 change. The Huggies One and Done wipes are textured and thick and you only have to use 1 or 2 wipes. After trying both brands, I think I will switch to Huggies. But these Pampers wipes are great if your little one has a sensitive bum as they are very soft and NOT textured. I've also used Pampers Senitive Skin wipes which are also nice, but again, thin. But would be good if your little peanut has sensitive skin. Hope this helps any newbie moms like I was :)	&&&
Choosing to use the Pledge Lemon Wipes was the best decision I made in cleaning products. The fact that they came in wipes was the best part. I could easily remove one wipe and clean all the dust from my wooden furniture. I loved the shine it gave my china cabinet and my wooden coffee tables. They are quite old but these Pledge Lemon Wipes made them all look brand new. I prefer the wipes because they are so much more convenient and they are so much more handy. I like that I can just throw the wipe away when finished instead of using a old dirty rag to clean with. I was really impressed with the scent. The lemon scent the wipes have is the best. I love the lemon smell that fills my home when after using these wipes. They are effective in cleaning dust and dirt that accumulates on wooden surfaces. I have and will continue to recommend this product to my friends and family.	&&&
I haven't really been too impressed with the babyganics stuff I have purchased at all. From the disinfecting wipes, to the baby wipes not my favorite for sure. I seriously wish they worked out I just felt they were too thin and not very good at getting the job done.	&&&
These are the best baby wipes you can buy. I have tried the high brand named ones and I much prefer these. With a houseful of boys, I use these wipes on everything from dirty faces and hands to wiping up spills on the counter top. They are an amazing product for the price.	&&&
I have not been able to find these in our local stores. So glad to see they are still around and I was able to purchase a large quantity. This was a good bargain.	&&&
I prefer the spray bottle to the wipes. Had to use a lot of elbow grease to get the items off the screen.	&&&
These wipes are amazing. They clean pacifiers and teething toys on-the-go. I don't know what I would do without these, there isn't always a sink available. My daughter also loves the grape after taste.	&&&
Just use baby wipes. No difference	&&&
We have used these wipes since my youngest was born (now 2.5 years old) and we prefer them over all the others we have used. The only issue we have had was that the wipes seem to stick together	&&&
We started our daughter off on these wipes right after she was born. We switched to another big name after getting a deal on them and they irritated her skin. Pampers sensitive are the only wipes we will use!	&&&
Great product, great quality, great price ... no problems whatsoever ... I would (and do) highly recommend	&&&
These wipes smell sooo good! They really do make my baby's skin softer and nicely scented!	&&&
I absolutely love antibacterial wipes for children, to have in your purse, and for on the go. Clean fresh hands with a pleasant scent.#GotItFree	&&&
Works great. Nice container with slow raising pop up cover and has a weight that holds down the wipes allowing only one wipe to pull out each time.no complaints or negatives about it.	&&&
love the little holder when done I use it for different things and I don't even have a baby yet!	&&&
Great for quick cleanups anywhere in the house!	&&&
Baby has very sensitive skin and these are very gentle. Very happy with the product. The're sturdy and don't fall apart when using like other brands.	&&&
"This product is very good with leather , I like it !
Thanks Staples !""}},"	&&&
Does a good job. Cleans well with no streaking.	&&&
Convenient. Clorox on a towel comes in handy for an old man.	&&&
These are so incredibly soft! What a great gift for new moms, or even for the use of toddlers and young children!	&&&
Great product and stay moist longer than other products.	&&&
Seems to work. I haven't caught anything terrible and the lemon smell is pleasant.	&&&
I was a bit unsure about these when I first got them. Thought they might be a bit gimmicky, but I am very very impressed with the job they do, The rough side gets rid of all the nastiness the day creates and the smooth side refreshes you feeling like you never went to work in the first place..	&&&
Great product, great price, fast shipping.	&&&
Super soft and nice. Using for giving sponge bath and for general wiping for the baby	&&&
So. We've embarked on Adventures in Solid Foods! This puts more wipe between me and my daughter's spooky poops. And I really appreciate that. A lot.	&&&
These are nice sized baby washcloths. They are super soft and gentle. I actually use them to wash my face because they are so soft and gentle. I love that these are bigger than many other baby washcloths too. Each one came rolled up with a little ribbon tied around it and it looked quite cute. This would be a perfect gift to give anyone expecting a baby or to give at a baby shower. They are even perfect to use for your own self. These do not have to be used just for babies. I love them. They come in three nice soft pastel colors. I could not be happier with them. I know they are gentle on my skin and I feel confident when I use them. I received this product for testing and quality purposes and I am so glad. I highly recommend these washcloths for babies or grownups.	&&&
How dirty & miserable life would be without Clorox Wipes! I can't bear to imagine! (maybe that was a little melodramatic...but I LOVE my Clorox wipes) One of the greatest inventions of all time!	&&&
Great for eye make up remover...it does not hurt the eyes and it does remove the make up and I have use this product for 3 years and no complaints.	&&&
Smells good, like maybe pineapple and coconut. They are very wet as well. Some wipes you buy dry out in a short time after being opened. I like the germ killing factor as well.	&&&
I been purchasing the wipes for many years. This new box that I opened this weekend, I was in shock. They have a really bad smell to them. I called the company they said that, they changed the ingredients recently. For much better health reasons. I did not know that adding cow's manure would be more organic. I cannot believe they have not recalled these wipes yet. Nor taken them off the shelf's. They leave a stinging sensation on the skin when you use these wipes.	&&&
My son has very sensitive skin and gets horrible diaper rash. Typically the doctor tells you not to use wipes when this happens which can be difficult but water wipes are the perfect solution, since they are just water and grapefruit extract. My dr hadn't heard of them but showed her and she loves them and is now recommending them to other patients with similar issues.	&&&
These wipes do a good job making your skin feel fresh and clean.	&&&
My daughter's preference in baby wipes, a good value.	&&&
Good wipes, do the job. Did not like the scent though.	&&&
An absolute MUSt if you are taking your little one out in the sun. Shade doesn't keep the baby completely covered. We were on a cruise with our Grandson and used this product whenever we went out. Even though we kept him in the shade as much as possible, we kept him protected with this product and there were no issues with sunburn! Buy it; use it.	&&&
A Love these!!! They are great for cleaning the kitchen table. And i also love using them for cleaning the bathrooms. They have a nice clean scent, and great size with a lot of wipes inside. We use them pretty much every day	&&&
The spray works great, but the wipes I threw out due to it being to dry to use.	&&&
I love this brand! I have been using them for awhile and will continue to use this brand. My daughter has ever sensitive skin and these work great for her.	&&&
I received this as an exchange for a honest review from influenster and i just love it! Being hinest i never try this product before ,but after a night out and with heavy makeup on ,i tried them and let me tell you that they are amazing ,they took all my makeup out and my face looks hidrated and I didn't even need to put my hidratation cream on ,the inly thing i can say about this that is not actually good is the material of the wipes ,is kind of hard and when i use wipes i prefer som ething more soft ,but anyways that's just a small part and i would definitely buy this ones in the future!	&&&
These are so soft and gentle on my kids bums. I love that there is no smell as well. I helps with my son who has sensory processing disorder. Paper towels are to rough when wiping his face and these are perfect!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
In just one or two uses these wipes made my skin almost unbearably irritated. I've never had a problem with skin sensitivity (ever, with any product) and I have no allergies, but 12 hours after use, my skin feel like I'd rinsed it with acid! My under eyes in particular, where the skin is thin, stung so much I almost couldn't even apply medicated lotion to soothe them. The skin didn't redden at all, but instead dried up and looked slightly scaly (especially under makeup). I don't know why these are advertised as "gentle." And the cherry on top is they're not even mediocre at makeup removal. Save yourself some pain and invest in a different product.	&&&
These are nice baby wipes, but they are sooo much more expensive than other brands. The do tend to irritate my daughter's skin (a little redness), but most "natural" brands do, so I'm guessing there a common ingredient that the all use that bothers her.	&&&
We have been using these and another brand of wipes for the past ten months. I bought two brands to compare, since this was my first time using cloth diapers and wipes. These do get the mess off, but are very thin and feel rough. I do not prefer them. They also seem to pill more compared to the others I purchased. Would not buy again.	&&&
"I love Boogie wipes - when my boys have a cold it's perfect so when you wipe it doesn't hurt and the saline helps them to breathe better."	&&&
These wipes are non-alcohol based and thus leave streaks. You can wipe the streaks dry after you use them with a dry cloth or something and the result is acceptable.	&&&
I admit, as a new mom, I tried many different wipes to ensure I was getting the best ones for my baby's sensitive spots. Huggies Natural Care are by far the best wipes I have ever used. They are thick to get the job done quick (many accidents from being a first time mom and trying to take my time) and soft so as to not be rough with those next morning messes. There is a cute little duck design which helps with the ease of cleaning which is definitely a plus since my baby and I love ducks!	&&&
"I purchased this kit based on reviews from Autogeek.net.

The vinylex does a good job at protecting the dash and plastic panels and as a bonus seems to repel dust. It is a bit shinier than I would like, but I wiped the excess with a wet microfiber and was satisfied with the result.

The leather cleaner foams nicely and wipes away cleanly, the conditioner spreads evenly and disappears into the leather without any obvious leftover. I wiped the seats with a wet microfiber after letting it soak in to be sure though.

Would purchase again."	&&&
when you try to pull from tub they rip apart into pieces and feel rough. Luckily I got on Black Friday for half price as I will be tossing the ENTIRE BOX. what a waste. Will not purchase again. Very cheap	&&&
"I really like these wipes. At first I was surprised at how thin they were because I had been using a thicker variety but in short time I liked these more. You don't need such a thick wipe for just a wet diaper and you can layer two together for a poo diaper. My son's skin has had no issues with these wipes because they are more natural than others. They also aren't too moist like some other brands."	&&&
"Comparing to my experience with Huggies:

- Pampers wipes are REALLY moist!!! After wiping my child's hand with the wipe, her fingers are completely wet! Huggies has the right amount of moist for me.

- Pampers wipes have no grip. After I wipe the play pad, I notice all the dirt are somehow ""expelled"" by the wipe. I really have to use my strength to ""grab"" onto the dirt. When I use Huggies, I find it's easier to clean.

- My child does not like the smell of Pampers wipe.

I do like the individual packaging. It's very convenient.

I also find the Pampers wipe is very, very similar to Costco (Kirkland) wipes.

I think some people just like one more than the other. You will have to try both to see which type suits you more. For me, I will return to using Huggies after finishing this box."	&&&
these are my favorite wipes out of all the ones I have tried. They work so well and I love how moist they are. They don't feel "rough" so they're perfect for baby. I would recommend these wipes to all my family and friends!	&&&
We came to these after using Huggies Natural Care wipes for a while. I wanted something even less toxic. These are great. The wipes are not as textured though so sometimes I do wind up using a terry washcloth to get of some of the clingier bits, but overall I'm very pleased with these. I am just about to order them again. The first box lasted us about a month.	&&&
The wipes will thoroughly remove your make-up, BUT if you suffer from psoriasis beware you will have a horrible break-out in less than 24 hours. Used it for the first time after a night out (New Years). My skin felt as if it were burning and I immediately washed it off. Next morning (1/2/13) I had a horrible psoriasis break out and still broken out all over my face. I love dermalogica but this is one product I will never purchase again and recommend anyone with skin conditions such as mine STAY AWAY from it.	&&&
Good for 1or 2 uses.	&&&
Although I really like these wipes I find two big problems that make me not really want to buy this product. #1 they are not pop up friendly and one wipe does not follow the other which is a big deal when you are changing a moving baby who has poop, not fun at all. #2 the wipes dispenser cover is no good at all, after the first use it does not stick closed or just falls off and you lose it. I love the wipes themselves and their ingredients, cleaning but they have it all wrong with the packaging which is major to busy moms. I hope they fix this soon but for now I prefer to buy Honest wipes because they are so much easier to deal with on the go even if they do cost more.	&&&
"I usually carry baby wipes in my car, but I never know where to carry the container, or where to find it when we need it. These are nice because they do fit in the rear cup holder, perfect for the kids.
When you pop open the top, the entire top opens, exposing all the wipes. They don't pull out a small slot like I'm used to seeing. This makes them easy to get to, even if they come lose from the side notch that holds the next wipe ready to use. But it also allows them to dry out faster.
These are kind of small, just over 3"" square , but they are nice and thick and easy to use.
I usually don't like anything scented, but these are very softly scented and don't bother me. I like that they don't use alcohol but still kill germs. There is a 6 pack that sells for about $23 on Amazon, a good buy."	&&&
These are wonderful wash cloths. They are so soft and they don't get stiff or harsh after they are washed.	&&&
Great.....wipes	&&&
"Each of these Purell Hand Sanitizing Wipes is about 7.5"" x 5.5"" in size. They're thick enough you don't have to worry they'll fall apart easily. My hands and face do feel clean and refresh after each use.

The variety pack that I received includes 1 Clean Refreshing Scent, 1 Citrus Scent, and 1 Fragrance Free canister containing 40 wipes each, and each of the canisters is small enough to fit into the globe compartment of my car."	&&&
Nice presentation! Super soft. Can be used in gift basket!	&&&
Best wipes ever. Soft and clean and are strong and durable enough to get the job done.	&&&
Wipes...how much can you say about them. As expected, shipped quick!	&&&
I love that these wipes are super gentle on my baby and don't have a heavy scent!	&&&
Can't beat the price. Great product and perfect to stock up for new baby at home.	&&&
So glad I found these.	&&&
These are good & serve their purpose well however I feel that they dry out relatively quick even with always closing it up	&&&
Their latest formula and product in stores right now (October 2014) has a strong chemical smell and creates a burning feeling on your skin. (I used it to wipe my face/hands and felt a hot burning feeling after using it) ....and recently returned 2 - 900wipe boxes back to costco... has anybody else also smelled or felt the same?	&&&
Ultra soft! Nothing harsh. We love these. I can't stand the scented wipes. These are a great alternative.	&&&
Gentle and mild. Can be used to wipe nose, face, hands, etc. Great for wiping constant runny nose to prevent redness and soreness.	&&&
works as needed	&&&
Boogie wipes making wiping a snotty nose so much easier than a dry tissue. Its moist and has a much more convenient travel pack than normal tissues.	&&&
These wipes are very soft and gentle, but they don't seem wet enough to do a thorough job. I'll stick to Pampers Sensitive wipes, I like them much better.	&&&
it is very difficult to pull the wipe out.	&&&
Been wearing glasses on and off for 35 years and this is the best solution I've found so far. My glasses are more clean, more of the day, since I started using these.	&&&
I normally love Huggies wipes but these are terrible. They disintegrate while wiping and leave chunks of wipe all over your baby's bottom. SO ANNOYING. Save money and just the Huggies Simply Clean, they work much better.	&&&
I purchased the smaller package as a way to try these before shelling out for a larger pack, and boy am I glad. First of all, the wipes themselves are teeny. At least 1/2 the size of wipes I've used in the past, smaller even. Next they aren't very good at removing makeup, the size probably has something to do with that. It took two per eye just to try to remove my eye makeup off, and still ended up pulling out the makeup remover and cotton pads! 6 total used for my whole face, out of a 10 pack. I buy wipes as a time saver for the days I'm too exhausted to pull out the whole makeup removing deal. But this ended up being just as time consuming, more even, and wasteful. Poor quality product. Don't waste your money.	&&&
Very good on baby's skin. Good smell, very happy with this product!	&&&
My son having an immune disorder always has a runny nose and these are literally a life saver. His nose never gets raw and it helps comfort him with a nice smell. I will always buy these!	&&&
Received these as a gift at my shower and used them once we brought my son home from the hospital. They smelled amazing and took care of all the wonderful liquid/tar that came out of him that first week! We continue to use them because they smell amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I have used these wipes for years and I love them. They are not scented and they do not irritate my child's sensitive skin even when we use them on the face and hands to clean up sticky messes. They are also chlorine free. They get the job done!	&&&
They don't remove all of my makeup completely but they do their job.	&&&
Although my experience with the CB diapers is still a living nightmare due to damaged shipments and missing parts, I have to at least say that these bamboo liners are awesome. I tested one in my disposable diaper to see how it would work if my CB diaper fiascos never happened, and sure enough, it caught her poop so neatly I was able to lift it up and flush it. It does allow liquid through so some yellow fluid did pass through into the diaper (from breastmilk newborn poop) but if that was a cloth diaper it would have washed off easily.	&&&
Nice and very handy to carry about, with a great quality. I really love them will surely recommend them to friends/family...	&&&
These are great for using in a weekly vacation rental--no more stained or mildewed dishcloths. My renters use them for a week and then toss them. I use them in my own kitchen as well	&&&
"The Bamboo Baby Washcloths by Baby Organics is the softest material I have ever felt. They come in pastel purple, green, and yellow and in my opinion, the soft colors really compliment the softness of the cloth. There are two cloths in each color and six total.

This is one of the few products I see on Amazon with a full 5 stars out of almost 300 reviews and it is well deserved. The only thing is that you have to make sure to hand wash and hang dry them. I made the mistake of machine washing and drying several of them and they got frayed and the material even seemed to melt together in some areas. I really think the manufacturer should considering including this precautionary in their product description. It may seem like common sense to some people, but I learned the hard way. Despite this complication, I still think Bamboo Baby Washcloths deserve a full 5 stars.

I received this product at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review."	&&&
These stunk to high heaven of sulphur when you added the water otherwise I really liked them	&&&
Work great!	&&&
keep your lady bits fresh	&&&
The paper is really thin. You must work quick before the alcohol evaporates. I really prefer the Germ-x brand even though it costs more. The Germ-x brand is thicker, both my wife and I can wipe our hands with one towelette, do the steering wheel, and it is still has sanitizer on it. These Purell are more like the wipes you get at a BBQ restaurant.	&&&
These make up wipes are really good. They do not leave your skin feeling oily or a layer or sheen. It is also oil free and it does feel that way unlike other make up wipes that claim it's oil free. Another great thing about this wipe is that the wipes are biodegradable which is really good for the planet!There is a slight scent but it is bearable. I usually do not like scented wipes but these do not bother me. In my opinion these smell good. It is also light which is the only problem I have when it comes to removing my waterproof mascara. I do not mind that since I use a different eye & lip cleanser. But it does a great job removing skin make up.	&&&
These wipes smell great, and do a really nice job of cleaning my granite countertops... especially since I have trouble keeping my kitties Off those counter tops.	&&&
These wipes are great for bathroom cleaning. I also use Clorox wipes, but the scent is stronger and I trust this product.	&&&
"Cannot say whether these work well because could not get them to dispense properly. Could not pull the first wipe from the center of the roll in the plastic package -- pieces of the wipe just tore off like wet tissue. Maybe the smaller packages work better for such weak material."	&&&
I hate my mask but, I must use it. The only good thingi is that Contour wipes are easy to use an effective.	&&&
My wife and I haven't had a child yet (still saving up!), but we love these wipes. We have a German Shepherd, and after a long walk with him, there's all sorts of mud, fur, and dirt on our coats. Two of these wipes, and they're magically gone! This also doesn't streak my MacBook Pro Retina screen when I wipe it, even though I don't do this often because this is "clingy" and can damage screens with frequent use. You can use this to wipe countertops, and it does a better job than any other wipe we've tried. It's gentle enough for babies, which means no more rubber gloves -- unlike using countertop cleaners that make your skin chafe. These wipes are extremely inexpensive for the quantity you get (you need to get the refillable tub first), and last a long time for cleaning/wiping/etc. I also wipe down my briefcase with these once a week, and it leaves it looking very fresh and clean. A must buy for anyone!	&&&
Great product. Great for traveling, going back to work, or those late night feelings. Makes cleaning a lot easier if you are in a hurry.	&&&
These wipes smell amazing. I got them for my Yorkie Lhasa Aspo and he smells perfect. The wipes smell like baby powder to me. They shipped so fast! A lot come in one package. They are very durable. Most importantly I love how calm my puppy is when I wipe him with them he doesn't mind them at all.	&&&
OK, Dude Wipes make a great novelty item and gift. I also like that they are individually wrapped, so you can take them and use them anywhere. Are they amazing, no. Basically, any kind of cleaning wipe you pick up at the grocery store will do the same thing at a fraction of the cost.	&&&
Clean and fresh. Just the right amount of wetness.	&&&
way better than pampers which are too wet and soapy. huggies is much better for cleaning up the poops. They do dry out in the diaper bag mini-wipe keeper so I add a little water to it once in a while.	&&&
Clorox wipes are a main stay in our house! Weuse so much , that has to be at arms reach! Not only wipes, but all of the cleaning products have the name Clorox on it!"}},	&&&
I adore Boogie Wipes, like many other parents. I use the 30 wipe packages like crazy, so I was looking forward to trying the canister and not running out as quickly. Unfortunately, the execution on the packaging is pretty awful, as others have said. I thought the wipe would pull through the lid, as with most canisters; however, there is a half-moon of plastic under the lip with a star-shaped hole with a slit that you tuck the wipe in and pull through. You can only pull one wipe before you have to rethread or pull another out manually, which is a pain. The quality and size of these wipes is also not at all like the wipes in the smaller 30 wipe packages; the wipes are small (about 1/2 to 1/3 of the size) and much, much thinner. They are okay to use to wipe baby's face after a meal, but I wouldn't buy them; I only use Boogie Bucks to order on the website.	&&&
I've used these wipes for three years and they were great for my new baby when Huggies gave her a rash. However, I agree with the other reviewers that this new formula is horrible! The smell is so bad that I just returned them to the store (Nov 2014) after only using a handful of wipes! Now I have to try all the other brands again for the right fit. I appreciate the company trying to reduce harsh chemicals, but do something about the smell and packaging! Please!	&&&
Oh boy.. I go through a LOT of clorox wipes... I take them on planes (in the flat packs when I'm flying)... I use them at hotels... I use them at home after somebody has had a cold or flu. The clorox brand is easy to use and I think, a trustworthy brand. I sent these to my friend, along with other pantry items. She has a little one who is medically challenged and she is required to wipe down surfaces, knobs, etc regularly.. so I send Clorox wipes to help out. Amazon helps me help my friend as often as I can.	&&&
We have been buying these wipes for years, and I have LOVED them. Our latest batch has a terrible smell (stale beer), and my fingers feel as if I have been soaking in a bath tub (pruned) after I use them. I am so disappointed and hope they go back to the old wipes.	&&&
great handy wipes that work just as described and can be used for other things that Witch Hazel is a good remedy for	&&&
"I've tried several different brands of makeup remover wipes. These are the BEST!! They are packaged well. Besides the plastic taped cover...there is also a cover that snaps which keep the wipes fresh & from drying out. I also like the thickness of each wipe. They remove like Kleenex tissues & don't get caught or bunched up. The scent is very mild & fresh smelling. Most wipes come in a package of 25. These come in a package of 30 which makes it more economical. I love that it also comes in Value Pack of 60.

My only complaint is these are mostly sold on-line. Seems like only Target sells them @ their stores.

*Review by Tom Chu's wife."	&&&
Love pampers wipes, have used them with all 6 of my kids!	&&&
We love getting these on Subscribe and Save. I get them at a good price and always have them on hand. I keep one in each bathroom and one under the kitchen sink. A great item to have for quick clean up or to disinfect door knobs, light switches, etc during flu season!	&&&
Great wipes...nice and soft and gentle on babies skin. They're very durable and clean up the mess great. Definitely prefer these over huggies	&&&
great price!	&&&
I am just now reordering. They make me feel good and perk me up. It is not a substitute for a shower it is an emergency freshening between showers. Another plus is that they DO NOT dry my skin out.	&&&
"Not resealable packs! These require you to have your own wipes container as the individual packages do not seal in any way. Additionally I put these in my wipes warmer and mold grew on the sponge which has never happened before with other wipes.

They smell nice but I won't be buying again."	&&&
These wipes are very soft and do a great job cleaning off my little one. I don't really like that they are perforated so you have to pull them apart to detach from the previous wipe, but that is a minor drawback! Great product.	&&&
Great deal for subscribe and save!	&&&
Love these wipes! I use them on my daschund who gets frequent infections under her arms from being moist all the time. I use maybe two to three times a week and she has been so much better. She is licking a lot less and no trips to the vet for antibiotics in months! So this has helped my dog. They do smell like vinegar afterwards but not a problem as long as they work.	&&&
I have severe arthritis in my hands and using these wipes I can keep everything clean and disinfected without too much discomfort	&&&
This is the best cleaner ever! It cleans everything and leave the home smelling clean and fresh.	&&&
My mind is at ease!!! Thank you, we so needed these in preparation for the upcoming cold/flu season. Although we are keeping strangers and sick individuals out of the home as much as possible.	&&&
Got these for a great price - they do their job	&&&
Yes, I still like using the heavy duty cloths. Glad I can still purchase them from you.	&&&
they clean and do what they have always done. nothing to complain about here other then they need to just make them available in a 5 gallon bucket.... that way people like me with 4 kids can get one can instead of 3 cans going around the house.	&&&
My household loves Cottonelle. It's durable and leaves you clean without those fuzzies left behind haha! Inexpensive as well. Very pleased.	&&&
They are so easy to use and work really well. Perfect for any stainless steel appliance.	&&&
Perfect for sensitive bottoms. They are very durable and work well with my baby's skin. We've tried several types of wipes and these are the best on the market!	&&&
I use only Zeiss wipes for my glasses. I have been told it is one of the few that will clean but not ruin the coatings on my lenses.	&&&
Best product ever	&&&
Great thanks - got these for a care package for my husband and he said they are great and have relieved his needs	&&&
Works great	&&&
Meh. These wipes seem like they take a lot to do a tough job.	&&&
HUGE but works and love the Subscribe and Save	&&&
"Product is awesome!! Always have some in the house for when baby has a runny nose and we use them for our colds also!"	&&&
I'm somewhat disappointed with these wipes. They aren't as thick as I expected from Pampers. Honestly, I wish I had tried them out before I bought such a large amount. They do the job, but Huggies Natural Care are much nicer	&&&
Love this box size!	&&&
I liked the value of the product, great quantity for a name brand. However, we discovered after using them that my daughter is allergic to them so we had to stop using them :( To be fair, we also found out she is allergic to most store-bought wipes due to her crazy sensitive skin, so we now use cloth wipes. I had hopes that the sensitive wipes would do the trick but unfortunately not in our case. Delivery was very fast and product arrived in its own box (no extra box or packaging) which I appreciated because it's better for the environment.	&&&
I like to rotate with simple cleansing	&&&
I always try to have this in my diaper bag. My LO has a knack for dropping his binky at the most inconvenient places. Having this with me keeps my grocery run rolling.	&&&
The best baby wipes I have ever used. They are very soft.	&&&
Love the sensitive wipes for my daughter! They feel just as soft as her newborn skin, and have had no issues with being too thin. Gets the job done and keeps my baby girl happy!	&&&
I have needed to stop using deodorants due to ineffectiveness followed by extremely enhanced bad odor. I shower, "baby wipe" between showers, sanitize if needed, and use this product to freshen and keep body odor at bay. It works for me very well, along with my other routine. I am getting the results I had hoped for and will continue to use the product.	&&&
The wipes not only take off all my make up (including the waterproof) it leaves my skin so soft and I feel clean after using it. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't bother my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Always have them on hand	&&&
very soft and strong! They work great for my daughter!	&&&
The best toilet paper on the market is COTTONELLE!! I was already using the toilet paper and then bought the flushable wipes and now must use them together and even take the wipes with me whenever I am away from home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
less expensive and best quality even better then other brand names	&&&
I don't usually put much make up on but when I used these it didn't feel like I got all the make up off. I also think they don't smell good.	&&&
My baby has sensitive skin and these work perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These are wipes are great. They are soft on baby's skin and still able to be strong when you need them to be.	&&&
I've tried them all and this is by far the best. One swipe and the smudges are gone. I am able to use the same cloth at least a dozen times. I just fold it in a square and put it one top (inside of container). The more you use the disposable cloth the better it works.	&&&
These washcloths are a little rough for a newborn's delicate skin. They're about as soft as a strong tissue. Not scratchy, but no super soft either. If you're just using them to pat dry they're fine, but I wouldn't rub a baby's skin with them.	&&&
These are getting harder and harder to find but they are the best. to have the single pouches is great. they may cost more but it's so easy to carry around in your pocket or purse if you carry one.	&&&
We decided to switch from Pampers to Huggies because the Huggies were cheaper. HUGE mistake. My daughter has what looks to be chemical burns all over her entire diaper area. This started suddenly and without warning. She was HYSTERICAL, and we couldn't figure out why, until we removed her diaper. I was horrified to see how red and sore the entire area was. This started within 1 day of using these wipes. Unfortunately, I ordered the 648 count, so the entire box will be going to waste, as I am going to throw it away. I briefly considered giving them away, but I didn't want to risk being responsible for anyone else's child having a similar reaction. Will never use huggies wipes again.	&&&
i love these boogie wipes! They smell good and are ultra gentle on my little angels nose. They come in easy to carry litle packages. Its a must have! They are also very obsorbant. and they clean up any mess."	&&&
Living with sterling silver, on a daily basis, is very much a personal choice. It has a reputation of high maintenance. These wipes reduce, at least for me, that feeling of dread that accompanies knowing the silver needs polishing, again. Using these wipes, whether it's my flatware, my serving pieces, my decorative sterling, or my jewelry, the job is not drudgery or hugely time consuming. Glad to have them in my arsenal.	&&&
"I use to wipe up spills,clean up after cat, clean conter tops, use in bathroom for all cleaning needs,
wipe up any spills throughout house"	&&&
larger than the regular wet wipes, this is a great value! great scent to them and septic friendly! great value for what they are. Charmin beware!	&&&
good little wipe warmer. no more cold wipes on the bum. have had it for about a year and no problems so far	&&&
"I got these since I pump at work and can't rinse my parts between sessions. I quickly realized these are a waste. You can't really get in the valve or anything so it's doesn't really clean it at all. Plus I thought it left a soapy residue.

Instead I use a plain paper towel to blot off whatever milk I can, put my parts in a ziploc in the fridge (or cooler bag) with my milk in between sessions and wash out my parts well when I get home."	&&&
Definitely an upgrade from just using toilet paper. They stay moist and the dispenser is convenient. I don't think any more elaboration is needed.	&&&
Use it daily and have a excellent experience. It helps my baby p's hands clean enough..	&&&
This product works great on fridge only if I wrote it down after I use the wipes with a dry cloth. Without the wrong down I still had streaks and spots.	&&&
The wipes are difficult to get out of the container. You need to take the top off to remove the next wipe and it is very difficult to even get to the next wipe. Once removed from the container the wipes did not do a good job on cleaning the monitor of either a laptop or a desktop. They left streaks that are very annoying. Additionally they did not seem to have the cleaning capability that I expected. I was quite disappointed in the overall quality of this product. I would not buy these wipes again.	&&&
I have tried both Huggies and Pampers wipes. Huggies Wipes fall apart too easy. Pampers wipes wipe up more mess.	&&&
Quick delivery and super price!	&&&
Handy packets. but not cheap for the amount of lotion.	&&&
We got started on this product while our son was in the NICU. We've only used this wipe since then and he has never had diaper rash.	&&&
I usually buy refill bags, but bought these because that's all they had. I ended up actually preferring these to the refill bags. They seem a little rougher, but I like the price and that they're fragrance free.	&&&
These are exactly what I expected. I received 4 as a gift and wanted more, so purchased this set. Very nice! One thing I did notice is that the price on Amazon fluctuated about three dollars since I purchased them, but I feel like I got them at a great value for the quality. I use them on my 4 week old's skin and have no complaints.	&&&
Great product.	&&&
Everything is clean  	&&&
One wipe removes 4 layers of polish on all 10 fingers I've tried many others and none can compete with OPI	&&&
I love the soft texture unlike other brands it dose not feel like ruff paper towels and it does not leave residue behind you get a nice clean feel	&&&
These wipes were awesome. Easy to travel with and fit perfectly in bathroom. Loved their smell and how soft they left my skin. The wipes didn't leave a film or greasy texture to my skin which was amazing. I am definitely going to be buying these again. It's the first time my face felt clean and refreshed!	&&&
I received this product for testing purposes, however the opinions are all my own and boy are they my own! This product is easy to use. Just pull back the flap half way, and pull out a wipe and close the resell able flap back up. It's not oily, so it doesn't leave our skin shining like a star. And it removes makeup fairly easy! The only downside is it doesn't smell too pleasant. At least to me.	&&&
We don't have children, we use these wipes for ourselves. Strong and just moist enough. Been using them for years to wipe down my body. NOT flushable!	&&&
I have tried so many other kinds of hand sanitizers but I find that this one works out the best for me. I keep a supply in my car and in my purse--particularly during cold and flu season. The large well-saturated paper clothes are large enough to thoroughly clean my hands and the steering wheel, too! The scent is most pleasant and my hands clean up without any of the residual sliminess like so many other hand sanitizing products leave behind. I get these through my Amazon "Subscribe and Save" program so that I always have them. Hand cleaning is the best preventative against picking up viruses. I highly recommend!	&&&
The is the best you can get. Leaves our stainless appliances looking like they just came off the showroom floor.	&&&
Great wipes (very moist, soft). The only issue is that is hard to pull one wipe at a time. You always end up pulling at least 3 out of the package unless you are holding the other wipes down with your other hand (not as easy when you are dealing with a kicking baby...). For now I'm putting up with it because the wipes themselves are great, but probably not for long since we end up wasting a lot of wipes...	&&&
I always used the regular Lysol disinfecting wipes but now have switched over to using Lysol Dual Action Disinfecting Wipes. These wipes kill 99% of germs on any surface. I have 2 young children in the house so a clean and germ free surface is very important to me. I am always scared for my children to touch a surface or object that aren't sanitized or clean. I use Lysol Dual Action Disinfecting Wipes to wipe down pretty much anything and everything in my home. I use it for the kitchen and play room mostly. I wipe down the refrigerator door and the cabinet handles where I know my children will be touching, I wipe all the tables and shelves that are in the play room. I also use the soft side of the wipes to clean and sanitize some of the children's toys. I just feel much safer using this. I feel like my kids are more protected and safe from catching any viruses or the flu. I even have Lysol Dual Action Disinfecting Wipes in the car. I use them there to clean different surfaces inside the car. I even give it to the kids to clean their hands with if they have eaten in the car where have no access to soap and water.	&&&
"Love it. Works great. Well thought out.
Like the side window to view level
Simple and elegant design.
Hit also when I gave to friends"	&&&
These wipes are thin and didn't remove makeup very well. I had been using the Aveeno Ultra Calming wipes and they are much softer and remove everything. Will be sticking with the Aveeno ones.	&&&
I actually love these wipes, however, I will not purchase them from Amazon again. The packaging that contained the three individual packets of Simple wipes was soaking wet on the inside because the individual packets had busted open and the moisture from the wipes was absorbed into the inside of the packaging. Hence, the individual packages of Simple wipes were too dry to use. I just wasted money on this purchase. I will buy locally in the future.	&&&
I don't go anywhere without a pack of boogie wipes in my purse or diaper bag! They arent as rough on little noses as regular tissues. They have such a wonderful scent, i use them to wipe off hands and my son's little baby feet! Wonderful product, leaves him clean and fresh. They do not irritate the skin which is the best of all!"	&&&
These wipes are the best. They don't irritate baby's bottom like Huggies wipes did.	&&&
Nice cottony texture, no unpleasant scents, they don't fall apart while wiping, and you get more for your dollar with a package of these!	&&&
Not good for anything other than a wet diaper.	&&&
Thinner than expected but usable. Good stuff!	&&&
What baby? I use these for my bottom.. LOL much better than those flimsy cottonelle wipes. Great to keep in the car and emergency bags too. Just don't flush them.	&&&
I bought huggies wipes and they was in 3 big boxes. Those wipes are in 7 small boxes and I like it because you can take one of them with you on the go.	&&&
good for baby's sensitive skin	&&&
Love these wipes it makes it so easy to clean up the house and disinfect everything	&&&
Good price, but we had too many leaks, unfortunately, thus switched to another brand.	&&&
Smells great and works good too.	&&&
I have used these in the past in the lower 80 count and like the way it opens/closes and keeps the wipes moist until used up. I wanted larger and noticed the 2 packages of 240 count in a box, great. Well after opening the box, I noticed they are like Ziplock bags and difficult to seal after opening and will probably dry out much faster from not sealing properly. I would not recommend this box of wipes, simply due to the way they "kinda, but not really seal".	&&&
"Wet Ones are a must to keep in the car. I always use after meetings."	&&&
I love keeping these in the diaper bag and car. They work great and smell great. I use them to wipe the table where baby is sitting or the handle on the shopping cart.	&&&
i absolutely love these! they are great for stuffy, runny, sticky noses lol. also great for adults.	&&&
"I use these at work and they are gentle on the hands."	&&&
Before ordering these Lysol wipes I debated between the bigger bottle at a local grocery store 80 ct. vs this 3 pack. My decision was based on the price. if I bought 3 of those big containers for $5 I would be spending $15 this saves you $6 and it is a smaller package. I really like how small the container is. When opening the lid the wipes are easy to access when needed. The wipes are very pliable and smell great.	&&&
I would buy this product again and again	&&&
these are tested on animals! that's a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free	&&&
This product actually removed my makeup and didn't leave my face feeling dried out afterwards like other cleaning wipes I've tried. Also, there was no greasy after feel on my face, which I thought was the best thing about them. I love the size of this packaging and love to take them on the road with me when staying overnight somewhere.	&&&
This is the ONLY brand I purchase! The double rolls last my family longer than other leading brands (sorry, Norhtern). Softness and a clean feeling is what my family wants and is Mom approved!	&&&
These wipes are perfect for make-up removal, cleasing your face, cheap and quality. Always have a pair on me now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I received these in exchange for my fair and honest review. I am so glad that I was able to try these! I'm hooked. I use these wipes every night to take off my make up, every morning as a refresher and sometimes in between. Gentle for multiple uses per day but effective in removing all makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Not unscented	&&&
Yes it got off the fingerprints, and left behind streaks all over my brand new refrigerator that I cannot remove.	&&&
oh baby! oh baby! so soft and so cozy. these little cloth are so smooth that your babies wont even know they are being cleaned. so go out and get this cause it is a keeper I received the grill brush at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion	&&&
Excellent price. Works great and keeps my glasses clean and remove dirt and smudges. I also use it on my phone and tablet screens	&&&
I love the scent and feel of these wipes! Gentle and not a strong smell which is great	&&&
Serves the purpose.	&&&
These make cleaning silver SOOOO easy!	&&&
love this Wipes their are so much nice and clean you face very well	&&&
Use every morning. Makes a world of difference. Keep you mask clean.	&&&
I would not have been able to use baby wipes on my child if it were not for these. They are chemical free and did not cause any type of allergic reaction. I am so grateful for this product.	&&&
These are the only wipes I will use. All other brands seem slimy and gross, which defeats the purpose of a wipe to me. I love how clean these feel.	&&&
"I received this item at a discounted price for an unbiased opinion.

These towels are so cute. They arrived on time, no loose threads and very soft to the touch. I cannot wait to use them on my baby! I love the fact that they're made from bamboo. Now I just need body towels"	&&&
Like many, I have a long commute to work, so long in fact that it is embarrassing to mention here. So I practically live in my car ... and do also sorts of things in my car like eat. I keep a purse-size Purell in a cup dispenser but I'm always refilling it. Now, here are these wipes ... a perfect solution because they fit in the drink holders. How cool is that? There is plenty of liquid on the wipes, so I wipe down my interior, like my steering wheel, after I use them. I'd give these 5* if it wasn't for the price, which is a bit steep in my book.	&&&
This caddy is the perfect baby changing station for the baby and family on the go. I rarely get the baby back to the changing table. I also like to change where ever I am at. This helps accomplish that. I just keep it full of all the things I need and I can change baby anywhere in the house.	&&&
"We love these wipes because they are very gentle on our babies tushies. We use an alternative container than the one provided.
These wipes are nice and thick and odor free."	&&&
Needed for school, came right to my door, I'm going to assume they do what they're supposed to do and hope they use them so my grandchildren don't miss any school desk because of preventable SAI (school acquired illnesses..	&&&
I started using this product when I had mild acne. The first time I bought it my original purpose was for removing make-up, which it did... I did however find a few problems, Don't get me wrong the smell is great but the wipes are pretty drying. My skin reacted by breaking out a bit more, but I didn't really mind because I didn't use these everyday, only when I was too lazy to get up and wash my face. Despite the problems I did buy them again about a year later. I would say they're okay but i definitely wouldn't buy them again. By the way, Facial wipes are very bad for your skin, when you wipe your face you tug at the skin and cause wrinkles. They also spread around the make-up on your face and only get some of it off. I don't suggest using wipes to remove make-up or for regular cleansing.	&&&
Great wipes for my baby's skin , he gets irritaited easily but these wipes worked wonderfully. Great product plus awesome price! Thank God Pampers exsist.	&&&
They do not dry my skin out and I can use them when my allergies are really bad.	&&&
So soft and gentle on my baby. A wonderful product.	&&&
I love boogie wipes, but my kids have told me that this scent hurts their sore noses. We have since switched to the unscented boogies wipes and have no problems. Verdict - buy unscented.	&&&
Eye can see clearly now...	&&&
These smell wonderful and the texture of the wipes is more durable than the Clorox wipes. I'll always reach for these first!	&&&
I love how soft they are for my baby.	&&&
This is defiantly made for sensitive skin, soft to the touch.	&&&
"""The Weiman Electronic Wipes do a good job in cleaning the computer screen and keyboard. I also use the wipes on the hp7520 printer.



Thanks"""	&&&
not as i expected very small	&&&
love this product. good for my baby sensitive skin	&&&
"So convenient, I've used Lysol wipes for years, and never looked back. It smells clean, is just abrasive enough (i.e. sort of like a gentle fabric cloth) to scrub dried spots, and I feel like surfaces are completely clean and disinfected when I use this product. I've used these on literally everything. Sometimes it does leave the surface a little sticky after drying, depending on how wet the surface got from the wipes, but it hasn't been a problem for me. Simply wipe it with a dry paper towel afterwards.

Pro tip: Read the label for instructions on how to ensure that a surface is actually disinfected. Quickly wiping a surface with a semi-dry wipe won't do it. You have to make sure the surface remains wet after wiping for a certain period of time. Not like you have to sit there with a stopwatch, but it's worth noting, depending on what you're cleaning."	&&&
Great on my sensitive skin and effective.	&&&
LOVE this!!! Quick, easy way to wash hard floors. Also works on rugs in a pinch. Does a fantastic job!!	&&&
"Awesome cleaning power with pleasant scent! Pricing was on point, too!!
Not for surfaces with dust,though."	&&&
Excellent product. Easy to use.	&&&
Dryed up my babys skin in just a few uses, even if I use it for short time when we are out, I come home to find my babys skin red and in need of diaper rash cream for the next couple of days. A friend of mine uses them all the time with no problem at all. I guess it depends in your babys skin. As a previous reviewer said, the bags they come in are not easy to seal, but the boxes are great, also mine came with a travel bag I fill it to take in my diaper bag. I will have to try other brands	&&&
Very good. Packed individually. Clean well. Serve the purpose.	&&&
They work nicely to remove makeup and dirt, but they always leave my skin sticky and feel like I have to wipe it off again with water.	&&&
Great product. We will order this again and again.	&&&
"These wipes smells extremely bad. For last few days I thought my babies stool is smelling terrible but I was surprised to find that the smell is actually coming from the wipes.
Few other reviewers have commented same on smell but many aren't getting the same I suppose. It is tolerable smell for my wife but intolerable for me."	&&&
Ive been buying these in bulk they are so wonderful. Othere wipe ive used rip right when im cleaning his little tushy and these dont. Their very strong. I keep them in the wipe box it came witih and they dont dry out at all.	&&&
First time trying these and they are pretty awesome! My 6 month old english bulldog was beginning to get a bit yeasty under his rope/nose wrinkle. It smelled awful and was a very thick layer. Mind you, I wipe his nose ears and eyes with tissue everyday. But it wasnt enough to keep him clean. Bought these wipes and they cleaned the mess right up! They also help for dry baths inbetween baths and they smell so good! I will be trying the shampoo and leave in conditioner next!	&&&
"Our favorite wipes. I've tried everything - Huggies, Kirkland, Pampers. These are my go to wipes. So soft and gentle, without that overly greasy feeling. The regular Pampers wipes have that ""sticky"" residue feeling that it leaves behind on the skin - not so much a fan of that. These Sensitive wipes leave your skin feeling soft and clean, with no lingering wetness or stickiness.

They're also a good deal - approx. $10 for 450 wipes. I think Costco brand Kirkland wipes are about $20 for 900 wipes, and the Pampers Sensitives feel so much more luxurious."	&&&
Quick delivery, great price, will order again.	&&&
Great value. Quick and easy to use.	&&&
I love these wipes. My daughter has sensitive skin and these do not irritate her at all. I wish these were standard issue at hospitals. Why other baby wipes need other ingredients aka chemicals is beyond me.	&&&
What a great bargain to find online! I like to keep these in stock to use to kill germs, bacteria, and viruses. I highly recommend them to anyone. Just by wiping off countertops and doorknobs you can destroy a lot of potential problems using these wipes.	&&&
It is a defective device. Does not close properly and the wipes dry out. Too bad!!	&&&
Although it did fit my swiffer the clothes are very thin & didn't hold up. I'll use what I have as needed to spot clean but I'll just use the spray & papertowel or soft cloth for future	&&&
don't let the 4 stars fool you, i LOVE this warmer. the only i gave it 4 stars is if you leave the wipes to stick out of the top it dries out a little bit, it's not completely sealed. i just have to push it back in after i get a wipe.	&&&
Um, Hello, Costco, take a look at most of the recent reviews for this product-it is awful! I was a long-time purchaser of these wipes until the formula was changed. They smell like bug spray and burn my throat to smell them. Yeah, like I'm going to use these on my kids...riiight. Anyway, please listen to your customers and get rid of this garbage! Bring back our favorite wipes, please!	&&&
Not as soft as I had expected but a good quantity for the price.	&&&
These work great. Highly recommend	&&&
I have twins and have ordered these wipes continually for two years... Not only has the price increased, but WORSE - the wipes don't "pop up" one right after the other anymore. Parents who have had to do a one handed wipe grab know how important this is.... The wipes are independent, and not folded into the next one, so with each wipe you have to dig down and grab a single other wipe. I purchased these twice since the change, hoping it's a fluke... It's not.	&&&
Great price	&&&
Wonderful for all the time freshness	&&&
Fantastic can wax my truck in 15 min	&&&
These work great and have a good smell. And its nice to know they are alcohol free and have vitamin E and chamomile so my child's nose doesn't get all dry and sore from having to be continually wiped when sick.	&&&
These are just cheap baby diapers. You would save money by just purchasing the diapers yourself.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! I buy them for both my hubby and I and we use them all the time when we go to the bathroom. Gotta keep clean.. They're so gentle!	&&&
This is great product. I wipe down my counters, fridge, etc. I feel it is cleaner if I use these	&&&
Yes I love them always a buy got get them germs yep by by lol I mut have in my housd	&&&
I love these wipes! They don't have any smell to them, come in resealable packs. The box always includes 2 travel packs which is great for the purse or diaper bag. The best part is a box of these is only $20!	&&&
Love it. My granddaughters have had sensitive skin, this is the only think we can use with no issues.	&&&
"Very nice product, not necessary to have but it's really nice to have. Especially helpful in the morning when my son has crusted snot on his face from sleeping. Is very gentle and isn't as rough as a standard Kleenex when there's a consistent runny nose."	&&&
They're ok. Not great. Do ok job of cleaning and freshening. Not real big. Usually takes 2-3 to get real clean	&&&
I have been wanting to try these so I was excited to receive a package to review for free from influenster! These easily clean off makeup even mascara and even after makeup from my sister's wedding day! I love the natural, simple ingredients too. These are more affordable than other wipes I have tried with natural ingredients. I will definitely be purchasing these in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These are a must have item for pumping at work or on the go. It's so convenient to be able to wipe my pump parts down when a place to wash them isn't readily available. They are also great for cleaning nipple shields for mothers who have to use those on the go too.	&&&
Pampers wipes are some of the softest and most gentle wipes I have used. Definitely worth recommending! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I absolutely love this product! It's very handy to keep in the diaper bag being such a portable size being on the go! The wipes are super gentle to clean off my little ones face.	&&&
Easy and fast to use. Effective in cleaning the laptop.	&&&
Been using these since baby was 2 months old or so, 9 months now. They are very durable, never allow poo through to your hands! They tear down the middle real easy to make two wipes (use less) if you want. Also, price is awesome. Only negative, and what lost a star, the smell. They don't smell bad, but they are a somewhat household unscented cleaner smell, not a nice soft clean baby smell.	&&&
I actually really loved how easy it made my makeup come off. Especially waterproof mascara . Compared to other brands these wipes are my holy grail one wipe & everything is gone.	&&&
The nursery in the hospital used these wipes so I knew they must be good. I have been using them on my son since he was born almost eight weeks ago and they work wonders. I like the clean smell and the softness of them the most.	&&&
We have used pampers since day one and we love them! These wipes are gentle and thick and work amazing!!!	&&&
Although I really like these wipes I find to big problems that make me ow really want to buy this product. #1 they are not pop up friendly and one wipe does not follow the other which is a big deal when you are changing a moving baby who has poop, not fun at all. #2 the wipes dispenser cover is no good at all, after the first use it does not stick closed or just falls off and you lose it. I love the wipes themselves and their ingredients, cleaning but they have it all wrong with the p ackaging which is major to busy moms. I hope they fix this soon but for now I prefer to buy Honest wipes because they are so much easier to deal with on the go even if they do cost more.	&&&
"These are by far the softest baby wash cloths we own. The baby is 2 months old so we really want super gentle washcloths and some of our others seemed a little rough on her skin.
The are very soft & I swear with each wash they become softer. They hold up really well in the wash & dryer. I may just have to buy another pack for back ups since you can never have too many washcloths with a baby or kids.

*I received this product free of charge for inspection reasons & for my honest opinion."	&&&
I've been a fan of the Simple wipes for a long time and was excited to try this new product. The Micellar wipes are even better than the wipes I've used previously, and do an excellent job of removing makeup at the end of the day or before a workout. They leave my skin feeling clean and hydrated without any sticky residue. I will be keeping these on hand at home and on the go!	&&&
These are the only wipes that don't make my son's butt break out in a diaper rash. So great!!	&&&
They work for cleaning your appliances. I had a filthy TV that I couldn't get clean and now it looks brand new!	&&&
Bought these for my daughter she uses them for my month old grandson. He is a finger sucker so she uses them to clean hands, mouth everything. Great must buy.	&&&
"I was very disappointed in order these wipes. The reason I ordered was because the individual packs I could just place in the bag and go. Instead I received packets that the entire package has to be opened. So when I open a container is needed to keep them from drying out. Very disappointment in what was advertised and what I actually received.

Outstanding product, will definitely buy again!!!	&&&
Been using this stuff for about a month now and my skin is radiant.love it	&&&
I will use this on all future trips, I travel internationally, often to hot areas and this will be effective to use during the long excursions during the day when I get all "sweated up"	&&&
Fast shipment excellent product, thanks	&&&
I got these because I had a coupon...boy am I glad. They work so much better for adults than your average "baby wipe" They are thicker, larger and leave you feeling so fresh and clean.	&&&
I absolutely love Huggins all the way, it's definitely my choice of diaper since day 1 of my child being born!	&&&
I Love them!! I use them for everything! They smell good and they don't break! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I often dye my hair crazy colors; purple, pink, blue, etc. Boy, those colors really stain my skin! I always buy 1 or two of these wipes whenever I dye my hair because they completely remove the color from my skin. These are a MUST when dying your hair.	&&&
My daughter breaks out with every other brand. Huggies is the worst, but this one sensitive wipes never have a issue. No rash, no bumbs just a happy girl [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I got these as a free sample. These were the best wipes I've used so far. They were very gentle and smelled good. They left my face feeling clean and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We love these wipes for our son when he gets a cold. They are super soft on his nose and loosen up all the dried boogies without bugging him. I personally like the regular scented ones better then the grape, but the smell doesn't bug him so it's not that big of a deal! Great to have in the diaper bag too.	&&&
My family will only use Cottonelle Mega\rIt's the best brand.	&&&
I love these for various personal areas (ahem…. don't need to write it all out :o ). They don't smell like a baby (don't smell like anything), but are soft and strong. From that time of the month, to a quick hand wipe in the craft room, these do the trick :)	&&&
Kirkland wipes are the bet wipe on the market! They're strong yet soft! They are heavy duty unlike name brand and other store brand products! After using these with my twins for 18 months now I grabbed a bag of huggies wipes one day because its all the grocery store had. Big mistake! I never realized how slimy they were! Buy Kirkland wipes, become a believer like me!!! Order online for free ship! (Took a week to get them)	&&&
She's happy as a pig in poo now. She uses them all the time. A thousand for $16 is a good deal, I think.	&&&
"""These wipes seem to do a decent job cleaning,

with minimal streaking. They are very hard to

get out of the package without tearing."""	&&&
My grandchildren (triplets) have to use to sensitive wipes because they were born 3 months early. This was the best buy and direct shipped to their home.	&&&
I don't mind paying a little more for wipes when I know that my son's bottom will not have a rash due to the harsh chemicals that are on the other wipes. Soft, durable and they do the job. Great packaging as well. I will purchase this product again in the near future.	&&&
Without needing to be overly descriptive or illustrative, let's just say, you know when you need these and they do exactly what you need. But what's with the price? Can't possibly afford to use 1-2 per bathroom trip,it'll become like a monthly cable bill or something	&&&
These are the perfect size to have stashed in your car, purse, diaper bag. you name it. Baby isnt here yet but these will definalty come in handy.	&&&
I tried the "other" brand sold by Amazon and it seemed okay, but the wipes seemed a little thin. After reading reviews, I decided to give the Beaumont Citrus II Cpap Mask Wipes a try and even though these are a little more expensive (unless purchased in the 3 pack) I found it to be a much better product. It is thicker and has a lot more cleaner in it (which has a fairly neutral smell even though it's supposed to be citrus). In fact, I found I was able to reduce my costs in half by cutting each wipe after pulling it half out. There was still plenty of cleaner to do the job. I do still wash the mask once a week in very warm water and anti-bacterial soap (although I believe I'm supposed to use dish washing detergent) because there are, no doubt, some crevices of the mask I can't reach with the wipes. I recommend this product.	&&&
i haven't actually used this product because i put it in my go bag but it shipped rather quickly and all looks well. not testing it out though for fear i might use them all before i need to!	&&&
We use these for wiping down our goats before milking. It doesn't dry them out and the cost is low.	&&&
Nice n Clean works! It does keep my eyeglasses nice and clean! It's taken me forever to find wipes that actually worked well. So glad I found these!	&&&
"This is a great product. It holds a lot
more wipes than the usual. I have twins so I need to carry more. Also I found it fits in most clutch style changing pads."	&&&
For our sweet bulldog puppy. These really seem to be drying yet not abrasive to her skin. Non-irritating. Perfect.	&&&
Use them all of the time. Easy and convenient!	&&&
I will never clean a dry erase board with anything else ever again. I use these for my Paizo Flip Mats and will never look back. Buy them.	&&&
wipes are dry, not very effective..	&&&
So bad this box has so many dry wipes and i cant give you a good rating for that!	&&&
Bought these primarily as toddler wipes as my son is starting to potty train. As baby wipes they suck, I need about 4-5 for a poop diaper (sometimes more), vs 1-2 seventh generation wipes. These are difficult to remove from the package without tearing because they are so thin, and they are about 1/4-1/3 the size of a 7th generation wipe. However, for a poop on the potty 1-2 babyganics wipes would take care of the mess. My understanding is that to be flushable wipes have to be smaller and thinner, or they will clog a toilet, so these issues *may* be the same with all flushable wipes. (As a side note, we cloth diaper and our seventh generation wipes have on occasion ended up going through the wash without disingrating at all. Good for the wash load, but means that they should NEVER be flushed).	&&&
My favorite wipes for my kiddos. Thick, unscented, and natural!	&&&
I decided to try another brand. Scott's 1000 sheets. That stuff isn't even good as kleenex. To get the same result as 2 feet Cottonelle it takes 3 yards of Scott's. Believe it.	&&&
I use this product everywhere travel , in the car etc. The product is easy to use and store .	&&&
I can only use pamper products on my child because of her sensitive skin. I absolutely enjoy using the pampers sensitive wipes they help clean my child with out making her bottom break out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
It cleans up my bottom the best I like it the best too [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Its a container to put wipes in so as to not have a bulky container in your bag.	&&&
I really like this wipes case. It's easy to load and to use when on the go. I like that I can refill with my own wipes and it holds a lot more wipes than I expected.	&&&
I tried these make up remover wipes because I had a coupon for them and was able to purchase several of them at a very reduced price. With that being said, I wasn't sure how much I would like them but I knew that I was paying next to nothing for them. After trying them, I can attest to the fact that they work very well. However, I definitely do not like this specific type of wipe. The exfoliation it provides is extreme, so much so that I feel as if I am scratching at my face with these wipes. One side is textures while the other is not. Thus, I have only been using the side that is not textured to clean my face. In the future, this is a product that I do not plan on buying. The Simple Cleansing Wipes, however, I will definitely purchase in the future, provided I have a good coupon. If you are someone who is looking for extreme exfoliation for your face, this is the product for you; it is a good quality product, just not for me!	&&&
These are simply the best "quick wipes" for the face that I have found. Having truly sensitive skin, they do not redden on impact, as even some "sensitive formulations" have in the past. Price can't be beat. Multiple uses as shown above. I always have one out at the ready before applying make-up. Some reviewers have noted that they do not remove all make-up completely- they are correct, but you can also use the other side. And, I tone afterwards, thus completely clearing my face of make-up and debris. Sorry so long, but great products are hard to find at such a good price!	&&&
I love the smell of these wipes, and they clean everything! I prefer to clean with the baby fresh scent to a stinky chemical wipe.	&&&
SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT, HARD AND STURDY. CUTE DESIGN AND WAS ABLE TO PACK ALOT OF WIPES.	&&&
Inasmuch as I have a large dog and he has a thick, curly coat, I use these to wipe his butt after he's gone out to do his business. It was getting expensive buying replacement wipes so when I saw the great price on Amazon, I quickly placed my order. These wipes smell nice and so does my dog. Highly recommended.	&&&
Love this wipes! Only wipes I'll buy. My son has sensitive skin. Only wipes that didn't irritat is bottom.	&&&
Very good cloths to re-use. Does not rip/tear easily.	&&&
Great product! Great Service!	&&&
I am very picky about my wipes and these do great! I usually buy Huggies but these definitely are about as good!	&&&
The best way to buy wipes. As long as you have containers to place the wipes into!	&&&
This polish is hard to wipe off and have your appliance look good. Very disappointing.	&&&
Came on time exactly as described I am using them daily. I keep a couple in my purse and use instead of liquid hand sanitizer. Great for flights to wipe down surfaces and hands.	&&&
Great product. Good quality all purpose wipes. I like that they can be used for hands as well as household cleaning. Exactly as described. They are very sturdy, smell good and work really well. I'm very pleased with this purchase, and will gladly buy them again. Also, a bonus to know that these are produced by a company local to me! Thank you.	&&&
The thing you need to always have	&&&
I'm going back to the name brand. These leave streaks across all the surfaces I've used them on: counters, cook top, bathroom fixtures, etc.	&&&
Great products	&&&
The wipes are my favorite so soft and gentle. And leave great scent behind!	&&&
"These are hands down the best wipes out there and the only reason we keep our costco membership! I think you might be able to get a better deal at the store when considering the shipping here.

Why we like these wipes:
1. The texture is not slimy like the pamper brand and they are not rough like other brands. They really have the best texture.
2. The wipes do not have much of a smell. We are not fans of any product with a strong smell.
3. The wipes are reasonably priced in the store and you can buy them in bulk.

I gave a box to my sister in law at a baby shower for her 5th child. My husband and I went on about how great the wipes were and she laughed at us. After trying the wipes she has asked us to pick up a case for her on numerous occasions. Hands down the BEST!"	&&&
Was looking for a travel case to use while inside the Disney parks so that I wouldn't have to carry a full package of wipes with me. Once I saw these, it was perfect. Allowed me to carry a days worth of wipes while not weighing down my bag. Thank you for being the only store to still carry travel wipe conatiners	&&&
The Baby Fresh Wipes are definitely the best. I'd say it's just the opinion of myself or my husband, but this one comes from our 10-month-old son, Liam. He doesn't like getting wiped after an "accident" because of the other wipes we've used. Sure, they're softer than Baby Fresh, but they aren't as soothing. Liam's little bottom was not appreciating the "too soft to get with one wipe" feel of the others...But his bottom approves of Baby Fresh. Rashes are merely existent, but that goes hand-in-hand with a good wipe with a great wipe!	&&&
These are good for dusting. They seem to pick up the dust and dirt fairly well. The things I don't like about these cleaning wipes are the smell. The smell is too strong and stays around long after you've cleaned your furniture. The wipes are a bit too moist for my taste. They leave some streaks behind afterwards. The pack reseales good. All in all this is a better option than using dusting spray.	&&&
I wanted to like these because they are biodegradable, but they are just too dry and not soft enough against my baby's skin. We've used them for 2 months, hoping to get used to them, but they're just not growing on me.	&&&
For my husband who trains really hard for his Triathlons. Sometimes there isn't a shower around for some of his muddy rides and/or runs and these come in super handy!	&&&
"I'm not a big fan of these wipes for a few reasons:

1. Too wet: They leave a film on my baby's skin after use
2. Too slippery/No Texture: They don't ""grip"", so it is difficult to clean poop bits off
3. The closure: is a sticker.... I much prefer the disposable wipes with the plastic opening that clicks closed. These stickers are hard to maneuver with one hand.

I much prefer the Simply Right baby care Premium Wipes!

I do like that they are hypo allergenic and unscented."	&&&
The newest version out for a few months now are thinner, smaller and now in pink and/or gray containers (1/2 and 1/2 in the big box). I called the 800 # today and was told they'll be changing them yet again soon. Industry standard for being flushable or something or other. Smaller and thinner again? Price should be at least $5 less than they are if this is what they're giving us. The previous version to these was the best! Not happy	&&&
I have tried many of other cleansing cloths and found them leaving a certain oily residue which then you would have to scrub off! When I discovered SIMPLE it was fantastic and have never looked back. No skin irritation and no goop left on your skin to wipe off afterwards. I would like to comment on another reviewer that said it did not take eye makeup well. Eye stuff is the last part of cleansing so when you are finished removing the face makeup just put a few drops of water on the cloth and hold over your mascara for a couple of seconds and then wipe off. It works great for me!	&&&
Great addition to the diaper bag. While my baby most uses his wubbanub so regular paci's fall right out every where these come in handy. Even after bottle feeding son the go just wipe the nipples down and not worry about germs sitting up.	&&&
My daughter loved these when she was potty training. The refills fit in their wipes dispenser that makes it easy enough for a toddler to open and retrieve a wipe without having to dig or make a big mess pulling out too many. The squares are small, I wish they were a little bit bigger. Otherwise we like these and use them a lot!	&&&
These bamboo washcloths are unbelievably soft. We've given them way as gifts before and everyone really appreciates it. The variety of colors makes it great for boys or girls.	&&&
These work great on my silver jewelry. I was using a felt cloth, but these work so much better.	&&&
This product deserves 10 stars...my furniture has never looked so darn good..should come in a 60 or more version...	&&&
Was hopeful this would also work on mascara but didn't work well for me.	&&&
Very soft and quality is great. we are using it for our baby, no complains. satisfied with product.	&&&
"I thought I would do a video on the baby washcloths.

I know a lot of folks like to see what they get when their package arrives from Amazon.

The wife got these a couple of days ago for our brand new great grandchild. We can see that they are very plush and soft.

Anyway, I hope the video helped in making a decision to buy or not.
I did receive a discount for this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."	&&&
Really helps prolong our CGM sites	&&&
these are life savers.	&&&
These work great and smell good! Doesn't break out sensitive skin and a good price! also made well and not thin!	&&&
These wipes are seriously my favorite to use on my baby. They smell so nice and are so soft unlike some other wipes that i have encountered. These wipes are a great product to purchase for your little one, you will not regret it.	&&&
They clean very well my eye glasses, cell phones and tablet screens. It is easy and quick to use. Doesn't leave any residue or streaks on the glasses or screens. Very compact and excellent to have when traveling or when your not at home. I highly recommend it.	&&&
Great for keeping everyday germs away. I clean my phone and keys with them often."}},	&&&
I only but these now. The cucumber is soothing for your baby. I recommend this over the shea butter.	&&&
The best wipes at the best price... Amazon Prime subscription on diapers and wipes is so good... they come on time, when you need them, at the best price.	&&&
It helps the eyes	&&&
Does a great job cleaning up my diabetic meter and tester.	&&&
A good little facial cleanser wipe at a good little price.	&&&
A Always good to keep in diaper bag or car to have on hand for easy quick use without a sink nearby	&&&
I have tried so many wipes, but non compare. I love Huggies wipes! They are soft but sturdy and smooth on the skin. Would definitely recommend these wipes!	&&&
Perfect for cleaning around the house. . You can use them over and over again. Much better than paper towels.	&&&
I bought these wipes because my daughter has sensitive skin. But I didn't like that they didn't really wipe that good. I would buy the. Again if I had to but I don't really like them.	&&&
"Super soft and of great quality.5 different colors Cream, Lemon, Lime, Rose and Lavender..
Love the fact they are Hypoallergenic & Gentle on Sensitive Skin
Made up of biodegradable bamboo with antibacterial and antimicrobial properties (odor friendly) time will tell
These absorb well too"	&&&
"I like these quite a bit. I also keep a bottle of a liquid hand sanitizer that has essentially the same ingredients, but often I find that when I use the liquid it takes much longer for my hands to dry. Since I am trying to kill germs, I don't feel like it is reasonable to use anything to dry my hands. These wipes have the right amount of solution to give me the feeling that I have done a pretty good job of killing the germs without having to wait too long to proceed to the next step.

My only negative comment is that they don't last forever. I originally ordered a box of these from another vendor on 7/10/13. A couple of months ago I started having to do a daily procedure that requires me to have reasonably germ free hands. I had some of these left from the 2013 order and was using them. After I ordered this box, I found the remainder of the 2013 order and have discovered that a good number of them have dried out and are not usable. I am not complaining, just trying to give information. I suspect these work best if you use them up withing a year."	&&&
It did enough for how much i bought it for.	&&&
Excellent product that is packaged well. Love the wipes. You can use them at home or take them on the go.	&&&
Only wipes I will use on my child due to sensitivity. These are the only wipes that don't make her break out..	&&&
I love these wipes. They work great & my very sensitive child doesn't break out in a rash like he does with most competitors. They are a little thick for my liking but work great.	&&&
This is an amazing product! I can not believe how SOFT these washcloths are! They are made from bamboo so they come from a versatile, renewable source. The individual ribbons on each washcloth makes this item perfect gift. In fact, my wife is going to use these washcloths to give as a baby shower gift. They are so soft and I have sensitive skin, I may just order another set for myself!	&&&
I used these to help clean my old kitty once she stopped grooming. They were helpful	&&&
I have been buying these wipes for nearly 4yrs now and loved them! I recently purchased another box and whatever they changed made them smell absolutely horrible!!! I would take them back, but I'm sure I threw the receipt away. Highly dissapointed in the new "improvement" I will not be buying this brand of wipes anymore if they do not go back to the old wipes.	&&&
I Love these wipes they are thick and durable and gentle on baby. Have tried other brands and they don't compare.	&&&
I've seen so many moms use these, so I figured I should give them a try! They're definitely really handy!	&&&
Only 4 stars because the price should be about 1.50 less	&&&
Amazingly simple and fast to use. I take it on trips to wipe down the rental car, airplane seat and hotel room. I also use it at home for all the handles. Love this product!!!!	&&&
"We love these wipes because they are very gentle on our babies tushies. We use an alternative container than the one provided.
These wipes are nice and thick and odor free."	&&&
Cleans well and only have to use one!	&&&
Very nice product, not necessary to have but it's really nice to have. Especially helpful in the morning when my son has crusted snot on his face from sleeping. Is very gentle and isn't as rough as a standard Kleenex when there's a consistent runny nose.	&&&
"This product worked very well to clean the screens on all my computers. One wipe lasted through all 4 computer screens and also my phone."	&&&
Product came in a timely manner, exceed expectation. I am fully satisfied with my purchase and I be shopping again for more products.	&&&
NICE & THICK - DO THE JOB	&&&
I got this for traveling - I have used them before and liked having them on hand. That was the last box anyway. These are the same size but open up stiff and drippy. They will do the job, but blech :(	&&&
They stay moist. Good product.	&&&
these work like a charm while pumping at work or on the go. I still like to wash all the parts daily, but it makes the in-between cleanup a breeze.	&&&
Must have for cold and flu season!	&&&
Very useful for newborns! The warm wipes definitely help with the first few number 2 diaper changes which can be very difficult.	&&&
they are a little coarse.	&&&
These wipes are great for babies of all ages from Newborns to Toddlers. The thickness of the wipes is great making sure no mess comes through on your hands. The fact that they do not contain all the chemicals the other wipes do is also a plus for sensitive skin.	&&&
Exactly as described and I kinda prefer the Lysol ones over Clorox as I think the smell is more pleasant.	&&&
I love most Seventh Generation products! They are good for you and the environment, which is what prompted me to try these wipes for my newborn. I received a free sample to try before purchasing them. They are really thick (almost a bit stiff) and have a cute pattern stamped on them. The only drawback is they are a bit soapy for free and clear wipes. I rinse my wipes in water to make doubly sure they are free of any soap and these have quite a bit compared to the others I have tried. Overall, they are a good eco-friendly wipe, just better for those with non-sensitive skin.	&&&
These wipes our definitely our favorite. They work well and seem to be more wet than other brands.	&&&
Exelent stuff really great. I like it and I hope people used	&&&
I really like the softness of these! I'm a lifer for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
LOVE the coconut cleanser wipes they are seriously the best and so worth $7.50 for I defiantly recommend buying and I am looking forward to trying the other kinds they have!	&&&
We love the texture and the feel of Cottonelle Toilet paper. It leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.	&&&
My son has been having some sensitive going on and having some rash around his butt and since I try these, they are amazing and never had any issues since! Very nice and smooth! I only use the unsent one...other smelling ones are not the best when it comes to poopy diapers (makes you even gag more). Other than that PAMPERS YOU ROCK! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I use this product to clean the pacifier and spoons.	&&&
exactly what I wanted and fast shipping. These are the best.. at least the ones that say Kitchen Grease cleaner on them. Perfect for so many uses.	&&&
This review is for Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes. Many of the reviews associated with this product on Amazon are reviews for a different Aveeno product. Maybe Amazon can get this straightened out. Anyway, I gave this product (the makeup removing wipes) 5 stars because it works very well for me. I have itchy, sensitive, very reactive skin on my face. I have tried many different brands and this is the only brand that doesn't make my skin go into over-active itchy mode. For me, this is an excellent product and I am so happy to have found it. Great for removing makeup or refreshing your face on a hot, steamy day. A+!!	&&&
Love these wipes my daughter has only had one diaper rash since she was born and she's almost 2 .. Very soft on her skin	&&&
I really like this product. You can use it for cleaning phones, remotes, kids hands etc.	&&&
These are the best wipes... contains no alcohol or perfumes. Just contains water and fruit extract. Not sure why these aren't sold in stores as they seem to be the safest for babies. For those who say they saw mold on them... I have been using these for over a year and I never had a problem with mold. For those reviews that say they are not thick enough, don't come out of the package neatly, etc.... again, I've been using them for over a year and they are thick enough even for the messiest diapers! As far as how they come out of the package, I take out what I need ahead of time. I read one review that said they suspected their baby got a diaper rash from these wipes... don't know how that is possible when these wipes contain only water (and less than 1% fruit extract)... perhaps their baby got a diaper rash from teething and it was just a coincidence that they had just started using these wipes at the same time. These are the only wipes my baby can use.	&&&
I loved these wipes! I just bought them out of curiosity and I really liked them! These will be my go to facial wipes from now on. I have sensitive skin and they are gentle enough on my skin but tough enough to remove my make up!"}	&&&
Nice to have individual packets. Convenient but can get costly. Haven't tried so don't know if works yet.	&&&
After 1 week its back to the same old look.	&&&
Wasn't a deal at all	&&&
Great product; I would definitely recommend it to a friend.	&&&
Works well to take off daily foundation,etc. (note-I haven't tried it on eye makeup). Has no scent whatsoever. Yay! So many wipes of this type have added fragrances that are strong? Who wants to smell like the perfume on a wipe or sneeze because the fragrance is so strong?? Thank you Boots!!	&&&
I loved this product. It's fragrance free, didn't irritate my sensitive skin and got the job done after just a few wipes. Before receiving these from Influenster, I'd buy other brands and the quality of the wipe would never be as soft or cleansing as these were. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love the quality in Cottonelle. I used to buy angel soft and charming, now I buy Cottonelle. It's the best	&&&
My little one has sensitive everything, including her little hiney. I was so pleased to find these wipes not just do the job of getting her clean, but also do not cause her to break out in a rash like everything else. Also love the clean smell of these too!! Love them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I use these for my daughter's pacifiers when she throws them, and I also use them for breast pump parts etc. Unlike some other paci wipes, these don't dry out, which I love. I think they should make them smaller however, because it seems like I'm always wasting most of the wipe.	&&&
I got this for free to try from Influenster and I'm so glad they sent it to me! I can't wait to buy these face wipes! They are extremely gentle and don't burn your eyes while removing eye makeup. I definitely plan on getting more of them soon!	&&&
"A must have at your office desk during flu season. Safe enough for daily use."	&&&
"I love these so much better than regular tissues. The scent is just right and my daughter doesn't mind getting her nose wiped. I keep a package in the diaper bag and one near her changing table for easy access. My mom accidentally used one as a wipe when she changed my daughter's diaper. It was a bit comical but hey it works for diaper changes too! :)"	&&&
This fits the machine well....no complaints....glad we purchased it.	&&&
"After learning the Lansinoh wipes I was using had a number of chemicals and contained parabens (which are a controversial additive) I decided to switch to a more natural wipe. I tried these wipes, Jackson Reece Kinder by Nature wipes, and Clearly Herbal wipes. Of the three, the Clearly Herbal wipes were my personal favorite.

Packaging: All three are in a soft plastic wrapping. Both Jackson and Reece and the Honest Company wipes used a plastic sticker for the closure. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but when the package contains wet wipes, the sticker gets wet and then the sticker will no longer stick to the top of the wipes. Then consequently the wipes dry out and the package is left open to dust, germs, etc. These wipes have a hard plastic closure that snaps shut. This is so much easier to work with.

Convenience: Both these wipes and Jackson Reece wipes would pull out in mass (seriously 10 wipes would come out all together). What a pain in the rear! Then I would have to stick them back in the wipes case in a wad and of course the little sticker closure would not hold shut. The clearly herbal wipes usually only come out one-two at the most at a time. They wouldn't get stuck together in huge wads.

Texture: The Jackson and Reece wipes are the smoothest of the three. They just don't grip the poop as well and they have a soapy/foamy texture that is left behind. The Honest Company, in my opinion, has the best texture to their wipes. They have a honeycomb pattern and they seemed to clean up the best. But that is not very helpful when all of your wipes are dried out (see packaging above). Clearly herbal wipes are a smoother texture, but have kind of a weave to them. They work really well except for sticky messes take a little bit of man power. The Honest Company wipes win in this category, but Clearly Herbal works better til the end of the package since they don't dry out.

EWG rating: Jackson and Reece and The Honest Company wipes both have a great EWG rating (you can check on their website if you are interested). Clearly Herbal wipes are not included on the EWG rating database, so I don't know how they compare on there. However, after reading through the ingredient list I believe these would rate very similarly to the other two wipes.

Price: The Honest Wipes are a better price on their website and in the diaper bundle. The diaper bundle seemed to last me forever (maybe because I couldn't wait to be out of these wipes so I could use the Clearly Herbal ones instead). Anyway, here is a breakdown of the prices: The Honest Company (on their website) $4.95 for 1 72 count wipe = .07/wipe, or you could get the diaper/wipes bundle for $79.95/month. The bundle probably lasted me 1 1/2 months. Jackson and Reece wipes are 49.95 on amazon for a 10 count of 64 wipes (so 640 wipes) = .08/wipe. Clearly Herbal is $54.97 on amazon for a 12 count with 80 wipes in each (so 960 wipes) = .06/wipe. Clearly herbal is the best choice when it comes to the price of the three as well, which is an added bonus.

Lastly, my baby hardly ever suffers from diaper rashes. But when I was using The Honest Company diapers and their wipes, she kept getting rashes. I don't necessarily think it was the wipes, but actually the diapers. They just weren't very breathable.

Overall, all three wipes smell great and are a safer alternative for your baby. Most parents use wipes daily to wipe off hands, faces, as well as baby bottoms. It is nice to know I am putting something safer on my baby. Any of the above mentioned brands are a good choice. Clearly Herbal are just my personal favorite of the three."	&&&
Pampers wipes are soft and smells really good, it doesnt bother my baby or gives no rashes	&&&
I bought this hoping I could give an occasional cleaning to my small dry-erase board, because originally I used all the colors and the blue & black leave shadow markings when erased. (The red erases much better, and that is the only one I use now.) These wipes do get some of the shadow mess off, but they don't work all that well.	&&&
I got these wipes, I thought they would be great for my car, purse, camping, etc. well the thought is a great idea, but sometimes I have to go through two or three of them, so many of them are already dry! Very disappointed in the quality.	&&&
"Pledge Lemon Wipes are great for cleaning wood furniture and wood floors. I use these wipes to dust my bedroom furniture, my wood tables and even my wood floors if I happen to spill food or drinks.

I have used these wipes to dust my bookshelf, wood tv stand and even my patio set. I love the lemon scent that fills my house when I use these wipes. Not only do Pledge Lemon Wipes clean they are also a disinfectant.

I use Pledge Lemon Wipes to clean the inside panels and dashboard in my automobile. These wipes removes dust, hand prints and stains.

Overall I would recommend this product to anyone who is a consumer of other Pledge products.

Pledge Lemon Wipes contains 24 disinfectant wipes. The packaging is design to seal up once open to prevent the wipes from drying out.

Pledge Lemon Wipes can be found in grocery stores, hardware stores and even pharmacies. One pack of Pledge Lemon Wipes usually will cost around $3.00 to $4.00."	&&&
I've only tried a couple of other brands for wipes, but these were by far my fave from the beginning so they're all I use.	&&&
I like that these are mostly natural. They do a pretty good job of removing makeup and don't leave my face feeling slimy or stripped. What I really love about them is the smell. My husband is very sensitive to odors especially chemical ones. These facial wipes just have a light fresh citrus smell and I can use them in the same room with him without him getting a headache.	&&&
Grandma has no complaint about the wipes ,excellent, value and very satisfied at this time., would continue to buy these wipes for our grandkids.	&&&
"Love these wipes! I also use nasal saline but these wipes are gentle and easier to use for little noses with boogies. And best of all my baby doesn't seem to mind them. I think they actually feel soothing on her irritated nose."	&&&
I'm a person who understands that a bargain product doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a top of the line product. I use huggies natural care wipes mostly, but I will buy any brand that is on sale just to try. I bought these because they were lower priced than natural care wipes online. The ingredients appeared simple and the wipes looked thick. Upon using them I found the texture the be on the course side and the wipes to feel dry. They also make me feel like I need to apply lotion to my hands when used as a hand wipe. Not the best product or worse. I would say average for the price.	&&&
I've purchased Honest wipes for several months now and stumbled on the BRU brand by mistake. They are a fraction of the price and work just as well, if not better! I'm a convert!	&&&
Nephew LOVES these wipes - with allergies, they are great over tissues.	&&&
Love the wipes, but I can buy them cheaper locally now. Each can is now hermetically sealed so tight, any amount of ambient warmth causes the plastic seals to bulge so badly that the plastic lids will not stay on the can. This forces you to either live with the loose lids laying around the pantry, or poke holes in the seals to deflate them.	&&&
I love pampers wipes. They are really soft for my kids skin. They get the mess the first time around. I use this for all my kids, for when we are at the park or in the car or when we go to out to eat. They last a long time too. I get one box of these and it last about 2 months. Very happy with this product.	&&&
Strong wipes, sensitive, and I like that they are unscented. Our favorite wipes to use. :)	&&&
Love these wipes! Also love the fact that the package on the refills can be resealed. Great when you are on the go and can just throw these in the diaper bag.	&&&
I was introduced to these at the children's hospital in Savannah. These wipes have definitely become my favorite. They work so well and unlike huggies, they will not leave scraps.	&&&
I like getting these wipes, because it seems like they last forever. perfect for grabbing a pack and putting it in my diaper bag too.	&&&
This product has changed. The sheets are smaller and they disintegrate when used. I will no longer buy this product.	&&&
Take with us in the diaper bag.	&&&
Its easy to use and the quality is very. Its trust worthy and easy to flush..	&&&
These wipes are a little thin but they get the job done if you use more than one. They have a slight scent but it is very light and refreshing...much better than pamper's baby fresh perfume filled wipes I bought on accident last time. They are soft and my baby has never got a rash from them. This is a refill box and the bags cannot be resealed. Amazon's price is much lower than local stores for this product.	&&&
I LOVE THESE! WORK GREAT! SMELL GREAT! SENSITIVE TO A BABIES SKIN!!!! THESE ARE SERIOUSLY PERFECT!!!!!"	&&&
I needed this item to go with the Honest Co. diapers I purchased for a baby shower. They are very environmental conscious.	&&&
"You can't go wrong with these Lysol wipes. They're easy to dispense, quick to use, and packed with germ fighting disinfectants. We use them daily in our college store to wipe down doors, handles, the sales counter, computer keyboards, pens - anywhere the kids can put their germy hands! Wiping everything down quickly once a day gives us some assurance that we won't have to use ALL of our sick days before Christmas. Contrary to popular belief, most young adults don't know to cough or sneeze into their elbow. When this happens, instead of getting a look of horror and donning a face mask, we calmly get the Lysol wipes out and take care of things. Thank you, Lysol, for keeping us healthy!"	&&&
excellent working like new still from the day it was purchase up on till now.. recommend to others.	&&&
These wipes seem to work well. No problems from them so far.	&&&
this product dries out the skin - do not use it plz	&&&
Best wipes on the market. These are my favorite wipes for my son. One and Done!	&&&
Did u guys know you could also get there from ur local dollar tree store?? They also had a grape scented one but I wasn't to sure of that one...	&&&
I've been using these for over a year now. They work the best, especially for dry skin. I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.	&&&
"Staples Screen Wipes advertisement said "" cleans and protects Streak free, alcohol free Removes dust, dirt and fingerprints Safe for electronic devices and surfaces 100 wipes Staples Brand 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed."" When I used the quality describes was not as said.
I said YES for recommend since my box was not of good quality does not mean all boxes may have same problem"	&&&
"I bought both the reusable flannel and the thirsties fab wipes and have been using them for 16 months now. I highly recommend using cloth wipes of either type if you are using cloth diapers as they add no added difficulty to cloth diapering, but save a ton of wipes. If you are trying to decide between the two, though, here is how they stack up. For our use, the Thirsties have been much better and are well worth the added expense. This is due to several reasons:
1) The thirsties are more absorbant and wipe the poop significantly better than than the flannel. Both have a more ""rough"" side and smoother side. The thirsties is more towel-like on its ""rough"" side and is more likely to get the majority of the poop in one wipe than the flannel. (By ""rough"" I do NOT mean scratchy or irritating in any way, just the weave is such that there is more texture to it.) The ""smooth"" side on the flannel is actually not as soft, and I don't like to use it on my baby's butt as it is both not as absorbant and more irritating.
2) The thirsties is softer than the flannel. Maybe that would not be true if I wasnt using cloth diaper detergent, but I just throw them in with the diapers when I wash them.
3) The flannel wipes have stained. Not a lot, but some. The thirsties have not stained at all.
4) The flannel wipes have frayed a little at the edges. The thirsties look like brand new even though I use them now preferentially over the flannel wipes.

If you are wondering how many to get - for my one boy I am diapering and doing diaper laundry every 2-3 days, 12 is plenty, and you might be able to get away with 6. If you are doing laundry more frequently, you can get away with fewer...."	&&&
"This product was disappointing. The wipes are flimsy and tear easily as one tries to get them out of the container. I end up taking the top off the dispenser and gently pulling the wipe off the roll. They are not damp enough and I need more than one wipe to do the job. I would not purchase this product again. It is not up to the usual Staples standards. Also, I would not recommend this product to any of my friends. I hope you will find another supplier for screen wipes as this one has obviously let Staples down."	&&&
THESE WIPES ARE SO SOFT AND GENTLE FOR MY BABY SKIN...We love it	&&&
I usually us the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes to remove my makeup. I decided to try these and was very disappointed. They do NOT remove eye makeup. They are very dry. I had to use a couple to get my makeup off. Defiantly going back to my Neutrogena wipes. They are much more moisturizing than these!!!	&&&
"The pad is big enough for toddlers to have enough space for their creative drawing without going off the paper. The binding holding the sheets in the pad is great as you only tear the page you are intending to. Great price for a great pad."	&&&
I use this product all the time! When my baby's pacifier falls on the floor it cleans it without having to use harsh chemicals. My son lives the wipes they make his pacifiers taste like Apple juice instead of the gross sanitizer that makes him not want it. It both sanitizes and tastes good! I'm a first time mom and I would recommend this product to any mom out there looking for the new thing! They are in a small package so it doesn't take up a lot of space in the diaper bag.	&&&
"I got a free sample of this dispenser from the manufacturer. I would not have purchased it on my own. However, I figured I would give this product a try, since it was free and all. Plus, all those people in the television commercials with the cheery British woman seemed happy with these wipes.

I have to admit, I guess I don't see the point. I have never felt the need for any additional cleansing after just using toilet paper. So maybe I am not part of the target market for this product, I don't know. I'll try to remain objective throughout the rest of this review, though, so as to hopefully be helpful to both users and non-users of similar products.

The dispenser is nice. It is mostly white with only a small, recessed (not colored) logo. (All the logos and slogans and such are on a removable plastic film.) It has a non-slip edge around the bottom and, so far, my cats have not managed to knock it off the bathroom counter. (In fairness, they may not have tried yet.) The lid has a plastic hinge so you can open and shut it. There's another (blue) part you can take out, to insert the wipes. Then, there's a small opening through which you can pull one wipe; this helps detach one wipe from the next at the perforation between wipes (similar to other types of wipes, like the Clorox cleaning ones). This has the effect of keeping most air out of the inner chamber of the dispenser, which in turn keeps the wipes from drying out. So the dispenser is wonderful and gets a very high rating from me.

The wipes, on the other hand, I am not as thrilled with. They seem quite small to me. While I have not used a ruler to measure one, I'd estimate one wipe to be of similar size (but slightly different shape) as about 2/3 of a Kleenex. If you'd rather not feel the contours of your backside through a single wipe, you'd have to ball several of them up. At that rate, you'd go through them pretty fast.

On to flushability: there's actually a warning on the package not to flush too many of these at once. I have a regular sewer line, and I've only ever flushed one at a time, and it's been OK. I would not flush one of these if I had a septic system. I just wouldn't take the risk.

I have fairly sensitive skin and have not had a reaction from these. The smell reminds me a bit of a Swiffer wet mop cloth, although the texture is softer. I did rip the very first one, pulling it from the dispenser, but this may have had something to do with my technique in filling the dispenser in the first place. However, these are not fragrance free, so if you have had problems with fragrances in the past, that is something to keep in mind.

If you already use wipes like this and are looking to keep them from drying out, I'd highly recommend this dispenser. As for the wipes, themselves, hopefully something I've said will help you make a decision as to whether to go with these or another brand. If you are unsure whether or not you want to use wipes in the first place, try to snag a free sample or buy a travel-sized package first so you can test them out before committing to a purchase of the full system. Best of luck!"	&&&
I keep these in my gym bag and these are the best. Believe me, I think I've tried 7 other types of wipes. These wipes do not tend to dry out before you get a chance to go through the pack. I use them after I've had a really good workout and want to clean my sweaty skin before going home. They don't leave my skin with a dry feeling and they do take off makeup very easily as well.	&&&
This wipe is awesome to wipe off dried food particles and mud on LO's face, hand, etc. Also great to wipe off crusted boogies. We always wipe our LO's hand with Johnson and Johnson's face and hand wipes after he is out and about in public spaces, followed by these wipes. These are saline based, so not too worried about him sucking on his hand after being wiped.	&&&
Very soft and nice product. The colors are pretty, and they stay true after a few washings. I'd recommend them.	&&&
I was very disappointed with how incredibly thin these were when I received them. I was prepping some new diapers so I threw them in the wash along with them. When I went to transfer everything over to the dryer after 3 washes the stitching along the edges was already unraveling on all of them. I won't be buying any more of these and I wouldn't recommend anyone else to waste their money on them. I'll stick with my bamboo wipes that are thick and cushiony and just wait the 2 weeks to get them shipped instead.	&&&
I have been using these for a while and really love them.	&&&
Excellent and soft baby wipes. Very gentle on skin and do not tear as you are using them. I love Pampers sensitive wipes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Never have purchased but would like free samples spent to me.	&&&
I was sent these facial cleansers by Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review. I love them. I rarely find face wipes that I really like, but these win. They clean well, aren't too dry, and smell great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These are the best wipes we have ever used. They are soft and thick enough to handle the biggest messes. These wipes have a great smell, good price, and are sensitive to any baby's sensitive areas. My daughter breaks out easily and these wipes are super sensitive to her delicate skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Makes you feel clean and comfortable really love them. However they should not be flushed they do not dissolve may cause a blockage in sewer system. I put one in a cup of water for about 2 weeks it partially dissolved or broke up still had big clump. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I received a free sample of these wipes and the opinions are all my own. First of all, I like that these wipes are made using natural ingredients compared to other wipes out there. It's important to me to give use better quality products on my baby. I don't care for the smell that much, but that's only my personal preference. I would (and have) purchased them again!!	&&&
I started purchasing these disinfectant wipes while my partner was going through chemo. We used them at our house to wipe down doorknobs, handles, and light switches. I still use these all the time for simple clean ups around the house. They smell like thyme, which I like ok but some people think it's too strong.	&&&
These washcloths are made with care and are EXTREMELY soft (Words straight from my wife)!!!! She has used them on our two month old and she really enjoys the feel of these!!! Highly recommended!!!	&&&
I expected a plastic tub to come along with these for refills... Disappointed that I only got the wipes... Not sure how to go about using them without tub	&&&
I tried lots of other wipes but these are the only ones I will buy. I only need to use 1 wipe as posed to using 3-4 of the other brands. I would totally recommend this product .	&&&
Box has room for more wipes refills.	&&&
These are great to use everywhere	&&&
Good quality...no problem at all	&&&
Great quality, super soft.	&&&
Wonderful product!! 5 Minutes all done and headlight's look new!! I had tried the old method and I did not work. AMAZING!!	&&&
I first used this at a high- end hotel in Miami that provided them. I liked it so much that I ordered this when I got home. The individually wrapped packs are nice. One to a pack. Slightly moistened. I don't wear the waterproof stuff so not sure how it works on that.	&&&
Cleans the cats and the smell is nice	&&&
These are actually my wife's washcloths we have. Yes she loves them for our toddlers but is equally excited to use them for her own showers as they are very soft and a nice size. Not sure how the bamboo process is all worked out for the material to be so luxurious but it Certainly IS! Nice item will purchase again.	&&&
the screen i am currently gazing into is crystal clear!	&&&
They are amazing.... Ever since I bought it for my toddler she has gotten less diaper rash.	&&&
I use these for my 19 month old and i have always had a great experience with them!	&&&
Great when you muck up your bling and you are on the go! Great stocking stuffer or small gift idea for newly engaged girlfriends!	&&&
Great for sensitive skin- never any rashes- minimal scent.	&&&
"I am in real estate doing much business in very rural areas without any facilities around. This product smells very fresh and is handy to disinfect your hands while on the road; doing your business behind trees. I wipe my steering wheel with it, door handles, bathroom seats and knobs. It is handy to carry in your purse too. Not only is it a great disinfecting product but everyone loves the smell when I use it. Kitchen and bathroom simply smells fresh and clean. I recommend this product to anybody."	&&&
Wet Ones are a must to keep in the car. I always use after meetings."}},	&&&
Yes I use these to wipe my feet and between my toes. Even walking around barefooted in the cleanest house can carry germs on the feet. And these are a must for the summer crud from wearing sandals. Nice scent and no itch! And I am allergic to a lot...but not these.	&&&
Great item, good price	&&&
We have used these for years and all of the sudden they were not in the grocery store any longer. Never thought to check Amazon. What an outstanding deal on a 72 pack. Should last a very long time.	&&&
So disappointed in Costco for changing the wipes and then still selling them after all the complaints about the new horrible smell! I'm returning my box and going somewhere else for the first time in 8 years!	&&&
The 2 pack is a great value	&&&
I love these wipes! They are gentle on my daughter's skin and, best of all, they don't fall apart like some of the cheaper brands we have tried.	&&&
I like this product, I wish it was there was to go version.	&&&
We have tried various wipes and this style has been our favorite. I love the fresh smell, that the wipes hold together and the size is just right (not too big but not too small).	&&&
Great cleaners.	&&&
I really like these wipes. They are natural and do not burn my skin of eyes. The wipes are large and have no problem removing all of my makeup	&&&
I use these at home and in my clinic that I work at. With all these germs now a days these are my go to cleaning supplies.	&&&
Leaves white cloth bits all over your leather. Terrible.	&&&
Great to have with me at all times! Must have used several hundred by now!!!!!	&&&
This just did not work!! Used one sheet and its still sitting around. I should just toss the stuff I guess.	&&&
Worth every penny! So glad we intested in this box. Makes the endless diaper changes way easier!	&&&
I find this cheap and good :D	&&&
Necessary product for potty-trained kids to reduce rashes and improve clean-up. Not the best value for this kind of product (generic brands are cheaper) but work great.	&&&
good product When you order do not get the 800ct for 93.00 Get 2 of the 400ct for 66.00	&&&
My son loves when we wipe his gums with the dr. Browns gums wipes.	&&&
These little wipes are brilliant. They truly are the best thing since sliced bread. I have been using them for several months now but just put them to the ultimate test. Dark red fingernail polish with glitter, 10 fingers, ONE wipe. They are awesome.	&&&
These are FABULOUS! Love them!	&&&
Best wipes, went out of my way to buy this on sale so I didn't have to buy other brands. Nice thing about wipes is, you can stock up because they don't grow out of them unlike diapers.	&&&
"Love the Huggies Natural Care wipes, but hate the packaging these come in. First, the good part. I love these wipes because they clean well without leaving my baby ""wet"" and without being too thick or too thin. They are soft without feeling like you're wiping with a towel (which was my experience with the Pampers Sensitive wipes). The downside, they come in 2 large resealable bags with a single wipe dispenser box. If you need wipes in multiple locations, make sure you have an extra old wipe box to use as these are not individually packaged. Also, if you do use a ""3rd party"" wipe box, you have to guess at how many wipes to pull out of the bag and once they are out, they are not the easiest to put back in.

Overall, it's still worth it to get these if you want to use them for around the house or have a small refillable wipe dispenser for the diaper bag, but I wish they came in a more standard package."	&&&
I've used these for years. Great at removing eye makeup!	&&&
"My third child is almost 2 and for the last few years I have had a mess of cereal, rice, etc... splattered onto the floor at every meal. Maybe this child is more messy than the other two were at this age. I grew tired of having to change his clothes 3+ times a day when the inevitable spills happened so I looked for an alternative.

This bib looked comparable to the more expensive silicone bibs. I was unsure, however, of the part that goes around the neck. I didn't know if it would be uncomfortable or if my son would pull it off as soon as I put it on him. I also read reviews about the bottom of silicone bibs not holding itself out to catch the food. I decided to go for it and what a difference it makes!

So far my son really likes it. The strap is made of the same soft silicone material that the rest of the bib is made of. The clasp holds it tightly so I am not worried about him pulling it off. It holds it's shape well and catches most of the food that drops down. He even fished some food out of it to eat! Washing it is a cinch, I don't use the dishwasher as I'm not sure where I would fit it in but it's not a bother since it's so easy to wash by hand.

I am so happy to have ditched the cloth bibs and significantly reduced the mess on my child and the floor. I should have bought these years ago!"	&&&
While I do like pampers diapers better, Huggies wipes are much better. They're just so much stronger than other brands.	&&&
I do like this warmer, but i hate having to buy refills for the pad on the bottom. I also don't think it keeps the wipes warm for a long time versus another wipe warmer that I've tried in the past.	&&&
I use these EVERY day in the daycare I work at. They work great and definitely help.	&&&
Nice wipes, flushable and resealable.	&&&
Great deal. Cheaper than Walmart. I used my swagbucks so I only ended up paying about $4 with Prime shipping. Should have plenty of wipes now!	&&&
The monitor wipes are horrible! They leave paper dust."}},	&&&
as described, very moist, great value	&&&
They smell so good.	&&&
Pretty handy, especially when baby drops the pacifier and wants it immediately back. However, just like other wipes, it drys out if u dont use it up fast.	&&&
Good product although I did go through a lot of them with my clean a thon of 400 pair of earrings! Even so I liked the way it worked with the suds.	&&&
These are must haves. They clean great and are perfect for carrying in your camera bag, purse, car, etc.	&&&
"I've tried everything - nothing better than these. period.
don't waste your money with anything else.
bit small, but who cares - works"	&&&
Good choice for newborns with sensitive skin. Does the job!	&&&
Although the most important part of changing diapers are the diapers you can never forget the next best thing, the wipes. Nothing can compare to the gentle and light weight Baby Fresh wipes made by Pampers. They make it so easy when it comes to executing diaper changing, and I love the scent that they leave my baby with. He himself enjoys the softness and light touch that he gets from them.	&&&
I used these wipes on both my children and still order them for the house. I love that they are gentle but strong enough to get the job done. I tried out several out her wipes from store brands to big names company's and always came back to these.	&&&
Makes quick cleaning easy without feeling like you are harming the earth. I am a fan.	&&&
We have an older Maltese who has recently been having middle of the night accidents. These wraps are GREAT!!! He doesn't mind wearing them at all and they really work!!	&&&
Pampers will be & always will be my go to brand for diapers & wipes. Sort of expensive & hard to find coupons, but still love the brand	&&&
I bought this for a young couple who really appreciated the practicality of it.	&&&
Great price for these wipes. We use them all over the house.	&&&
Best wipes to me. Love Huggies brand. And if they say 'One & Done' they are nice and thick wipes. Nice to buy these refill sizes. They are a little cheaper at large wholesale clubs ...if you like going to places that are always crowded & waiting 20 minutes to check out.	&&&
Great for cleaning pretty much everything.	&&&
I LOVE boogie wipes, they are my go-to "kleenix" for not only my kids but myself. When you have a runny nose it tends to get sore with normal tissues...not with Boogie Wipes.	&&&
Bought these to keep in my purse for the upcoming flu season - but a bit pricey. The gel Purell is less expensive and really just as easy to use.	&&&
We have tried so many wipes and this is the most gentle and causes no irritation for sensitive skin. The entire family uses it! Thank you for such a great product huggies!	&&&
These wipes are the best! A must-have if you are potty training and just nice to have handy in general!	&&&
I love this multipack! It has refill packs AND 3 packs of wipes with lids, so you can take those in your diaper bag. These wipes are great when my children have a diaper rash. I also only use these with my newborns. I have no complaints! I always keep these on hand because my children seem to get diaper rashes occasionally all the way until they are potty trained.	&&&
Not too picky about wipes but what I like most about these is the price. I was using the Sam's Club brand wipes for my son and one day I tried it and it actually stung my bottom a bit! That's when I switch to these and they're great for wiping bottoms, faces and hands. (I also use them for cleaning up minor scales on the couch and floor) when using the discount Amazon offers for its Amazon mom program and it's subscribe and save program these wipes are definitely the best value out there (and that includes the Sam's Club brand wipes) There are 7 packages of wipes that come in this box. They have a little sticker that allows you to individually take wipes out of each package; however, the stickiness doesn't seem to last very long. I suggest you buy a tub of Pampers wipes and then just take the wipes out of the packages and transfer them into the tubs.This will ensure the wipes won't dry out.	&&&
The new wipes in the new packaging are nothing like the old wipes. The texture is now flimsy and waffley, and the fragrance, which I LOVED in the old wipes, is almost non-existent. The cleansing liquid still does a fine job to take makeup off, but the new texture and smell (or complete lack of) is making me go on a search for new wipes. I hate to say it, but these new wipes remind me of generic drugstore stuff. This is so sad as I've been a huge fan for years.	&&&
These lens cleaning pads are not absorptive enough to usable	&&&
Great product for the price! Great for oily skin since it's not a very oily product.	&&&
Boogie wipes are the best for runny noses! They make cleanup easy and my son loves the smell. Grape is by far our favorite scent of Boogie wipes.	&&&
These wipes are peferct to use after a little time outdoors.	&&&
The best wipes for eye makeup removal - The only ones of the many I have tried that DO NOT irritate my eyes.... Love them!	&&&
i thought they were individually wrapped...my mistake...gave them away...	&&&
These are perfect for the job. The clean the mask completely and leave no residue or small pieces of the wipe behind, like a baby wipe would. They're scent free and that's a pretty big deal for me. I highly dislike smelling anything while using this. You should end your search here for CPAP wipes.	&&&
"exactly what I expected.
They will stay a subscribe & save item."	&&&
Dusting couldn't be easier. Not too dry and not too wet. These wipes make a hated chore a breeze.	&&&
"Love the idea of the wipes, and the wipes themselves - very soft, very nice.

Had to take away two stars because they are VERY hard to dispense, are overly delicate and tear VERY easily, and they also stretch when you try to pull one out of the package, so you end up with a long, very thin wipe. If they could sort out the quality of these, they would absolutely be my favorite wipe because absolutely, they are soft and delicate for sensitive baby hinies."	&&&
Arrived intact and on time. Wipes off heavy grease easily. Like the individual packets too.	&&&
These work great for wiping up spills, cleaning off toys, and wiping down baby gear to keep everything clean.	&&&
I have never had any issues with these wipes. They are soft and get the job done. They have a pleasant sent and I will continue to use them.	&&&
My favorite wipes! Perfect for any *quick* clean-up job!	&&&
I purchased this washcloth set for a neighbor's baby's birthday. The parents were very impressed with the great colors and the packaging. They were even more impressed when they found out the wash cloths are made of 100% organically grown bamboo. Wow what a unique baby gift.	&&&
"I use this product for my daughter's stuffy nose. Because of it being soft and wet it helps greatly with the dried up little boogies. For me it works great and therefore there is nothing negative I have to say about the product."	&&&
I bought these to give as part of a baby shower gift because they are made of Bamboo and I like supporting products made of sustainable materials. I also love the packaging as it is so elegant and perfect to use as a gift with the beautiful ribbons around each washcloth. They are softer than cotton so I feel great to give them to a new Mom of an infant. I do plan to purchase them again next time I am invited to a baby shower.	&&&
After leaving the hospital where Pampers wipes were used I was sold! We had a gift of both Pampers sensitive wipes, Pampers natural clean, and another brand of wipes. Both Pampers brand wipes are far better than the third brand as they are softer and stronger and take less wipes to clean up messes, thus being more economical! With my son we use both the Natural Clean wipes and the sensitive depending on coupons and deal but would recommend both!	&&&
I use them for myself, my 2 month old and got it for my friend who has anal cancer and it is gentle enough for her. Feels like a cloth with water... shocker!	&&&
I bought these as I use the travel size ones for hands for my toddler. I wanted something for the house to quickly clean toys etc. These are SO soapy. You wipe something and there is soap everywhere	&&&
Love these and a great deal! Will be buying again.	&&&
no more Clorox for me	&&&
Great gift. Got this for my sisters baby and she was very excited on how soft these cloths were. Highly recommended.	&&&
I typically purchase walmarts parents choice wipes. I purchased these on a whim since I had a girt card. I really like these wipes. They work very well for hands face and for the bum. They do not tend to tear and work well on #2 cleanup better than others.	&&&
Very easy to use and dispose of. Cleanest clean of all.	&&&
I absolutely love the smell of pampers diapers! It's a bonus to the already perfect diaper. These diapers absorb really well, my son is 3months old and he has only leaked 1 time thus far (mainly my fault for not changing his diaper before he peed again). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
This is your nice basic wipes for sensitive skin. Although i never recieved this vox box i did use it and loved it!	&&&
haven't used them yet but im sure they do what they say lol I mean cause really have a broken diaper	&&&
Love the fresh scent of the wipes and am happy with them. They clean up the messiest of diapers and have been great for our toddler's dirty diapers.	&&&
These are great! They have a nice weight to the material, but they aren't too thick to manage. The solution cleans up nicely without leaving a weird smell or residue. We use these exclusively most of the time, but in between Amazon shipments, I have purchased other brands. We have not found another brand that we like better than these!	&&&
"Love it
Great quality. When it comes to amazon and saving money this is the place to do it. Thanks"	&&&
May be old. Not wet when opened pack. It was on clearance, so not going to return.	&&&
These are the best cloth wipes we've found. They stay soft when wet, pick up the mess like a dream, are sturdy, clean up great and easily, and dry quickly. A must buy!	&&&
These toilet wipes are nicely scented and very wet. I had a plastic dispenser box from a different brand of moist toilet wipes, and they fit perfectly with the inner plastic pop up packaging. I had to throw away about a quarter of a package of the previous brand of wipes because they had no inner plastic pop up wrapping, and they completely dried out.	&&&
the wipes work real well on computer screens and flat screen tv	&&&
I've used Huggies "natural" and Pampers "sensitive" wipes in the past, however, none of then even come close to these wipes. My daughter had terrible diaper rash before using this product but since I've used it we haven't had any problems. The wipes smell like lavender which is a nice bonus. I will definitely be purchasing these again!	&&&
They're back! I love them all over again for our daughter's sensitive skin. Minus one star because, yes, for the occasional huge mess they're too thin. But these are much better for regular use than the rougher, thicker ones the company meant to have replace them.	&&&
I am a bit disappointed in the moderate cleaning power of these "green" wipes, but I was seeking an alternative to Chlorox wipes for health reasons. I find that I need to use these in conjunction with a "green" spray cleaner to get food stains off my electric stovetop and kitchen cabinets.	&&&
Delivered as promised, well packed and an easy despensing container. Just moist enough to get the job done without smudging or streaking. This is my 2nd box and there will more coming as long as I wear glasses.	&&&
These are by far the BEST wipes I have ever used. They stay perfectly moist until the last wipe in the pack, they feel like soft cloth and are sized generously enough to use fewer wipes on even the messiest job. I would recommend these over every other product I have used, and I've tried Huggies, Pampers, Mom2Mom and Burt's Bees.	&&&
So I never thought I would be the type of person to review wipes but after using a comparable brand these stand out as my preferred brand. Simply put, they don't contain perfumes and are sturdy enough to clean up a mess without disintegrating. I used the Huggies natural/sensitive care wipes and despised them because they fell apart too easily.	&&&
No harsh chemicals and they smell good! They are strong and do not tear easily. 2 week old had rash that was probably caused by other wipes and these helped clear it up. Would recommend to anyone with infant.	&&&
This product was disappointing. The wipes are flimsy and tear easily as one tries to get them out of the container. I end up taking the top off the dispenser and gently pulling the wipe off the roll. They are not damp enough and I need more than one wipe to do the job. I would not purchase this product again. It is not up to the usual Staples standards. Also, I would not recommend this product to any of my friends. I hope you will find another supplier for screen wipes as this one has obviously let Staples down.	&&&
I really like this product I'm a new mother and I've been using this product for a year now and I really appreciate huggies Company . The wipe it's not too wet it is just right I really like this it's really good that huggies have natural care because I'm organic and I don't want to use chemicals on my son and I'll recommend this to new mothers	&&&
I love these wipes because they're mostly water, so they're super gentle but they gets the job done!	&&&
reacted to it. rashes on face after use.	&&&
Great for traveling when you want to freshen up fast. This product works wonders after a golf game played in tempatures near 100 degrees.	&&&
Thanks, fast shipping great stuff	&&&
Cottonelle is the only TP I buy. I've found NOTHING that can compare to it's softness and cleaning ability!	&&&
Very durable & gets the job done every time! I like that they are a good size, not too big or small. I can almost always use only one wipe per diaper change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Great for intended purpose.	&&&
It's an HP and what do you expect. It copies in color beautifully. I love the size and the fact that I can do double sided copies. The sale price was an extra bonus. I had problems downloading the software by myself and fortunately called the Geek Squad to get the job done, but I have a 3 year contract and they are always there to help 24/7. I would buy it again!	&&&
I use these wipes to wipe down my little ones sticky hands and mouth when out and about. They have a lovely scent and clean up my babies tiny messes without all the mess of soap and water. They are great to use when on the go or in the car!	&&&
These wipes have been life savers for me and my family! My daughter was very sensitive to a lot of things she ate and these wipes made it much easier to clean her up while she was upset. It was a strong durable wipe that did not take a lot to get the job done. They were also very soft and not harsh on her bum, which was a relief to me. I wouldn't use any other wipe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I have always used regular wipes to wipe a runny nose. but when the snot is dried on I feel like I am going to rip their nose off.... These are great! I never have to scrub their face it seems to get all the junk right off!	&&&
"We now use these in the shop instead of the red cloth rags that we used to get from our uniform company. Much cheaper and
sore nice and neat on the wall if you buy the dispenser. FYI same as the blue ones... we just buy the color that is cheaper at the time of order."	&&&
Works great with our cloth wipes! We just add water along with rolled up premoistened cloth wipes and leave on all night and day. the filter needs to be washed out once a week, but always comes clean. Love the night light. It is hard to open i find but we have gotten use to it. Tip - You can add a bit of chamomile tea to your water and your wipes to soothe the skin. Love these with Water Wipes brand wipes too!	&&&
Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store. Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop. Buy with confidence.	&&&
"I've tried other wipes and always go back to the Huggies Natural Care. They are so thick and soft, and one does the job of three of the other kinds I've used. I love that you can buy them in a big box and transfer them to a small wipe box or the clutch, or that you can buy them in take-along packages. I'll never use another kind."	&&&
"After learning the Lansinoh wipes I was using had a number of chemicals and contained parabens (which are a controversial additive) I decided to switch to a more natural wipe. I tried these wipes, Jackson Reece Kinder by Nature wipes, and the Honest Company wipes. Of the three, these were my personal favorite.

Packaging: All three are in a soft plastic wrapping. Both Jackson and Reece and the Honest Company wipes used a plastic sticker for the closure. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but when the package contains wet wipes, the sticker gets wet and then the sticker will no longer stick to the top of the wipes. Then consequently the wipes dry out and the package is left open to dust, germs, etc. These wipes have a hard plastic closure that snaps shut. This is so much easier to work with.

Convenience: Both The Honest Company wipes and Jackson Reece wipes would pull out in mass (seriously 10+ wipes would come out all together). What a pain in the rear! Then I would have to stick them back in the wipes case in a wad and of course the little sticker closure would not hold shut. The clearly herbal wipes usually only come out one-two at the most at a time. They wouldn't get stuck together in huge wads. They are clearly the winner in this category.

Texture: The Jackson and Reece wipes are the smoothest of the three. They just don't grip the poop as well and they have a soapy/foamy texture that is left behind. The Honest Company, in my opinion, has the best texture to their wipes. They have a honeycomb pattern and they seemed to clean up the best. But that is not very helpful when all of your wipes are dried out (see packaging above). Clearly herbal wipes are a smoother texture, but have kind of a weave to them. They work really well except for sticky messes take a little bit of man power. The Honest Company wipes win in this category, but Clearly Herbal works better til the end of the package since they don't dry out.

EWG rating: Jackson and Reece and The Honest Company wipes both have a great EWG rating (you can check on their website if you are interested). This company is not included on the EWG rating database, so I don't know how they compare on there. However, after reading through the ingredient list I believe these would rate very similarly to the other two wipes.

Price: The Honest Wipes are a better price on their website and in the diaper bundle. The diaper bundle seemed to last me forever (maybe because I couldn't wait to be out of these wipes so I could use the Clearly Herbal ones instead). Anyway, here is a breakdown of the prices: The Honest Company (on their website) $4.95 for 1 72 count wipe = .07/wipe, or you could get the diaper/wipes bundle for $79.95/month. The bundle probably lasted me 1 1/2 months. Jackson and Reece wipes are 49.95 on amazon for a 10 count of 64 wipes (so 640 wipes) = .08/wipe. Clearly Herbal is $54.97 on amazon for a 12 count with 80 wipes in each (so 960 wipes) = .06/wipe. Clearly herbal is the best choice when it comes to the price of the three as well, which is an added bonus.

My baby hardly ever suffers from diaper rashes. If she does they usually only last a day. However, when I was using the Honest Company diapers and wipes, she constantly had rashes. I think this had more to do with the diapers than the wipes. The diapers just aren't very breathable. These wipes have not really affected her diaper rashes one way or the other compared to other brands.

Overall, all three wipes smell great and are a safer alternative for your baby. Most parents use wipes daily to wipe off hands, faces, as well as baby bottoms. It is nice to know I am putting something safer on my baby. Any of the above mentioned brands are a good choice. These are just my personal favorite of the three."	&&&
These are clean, fragrance free. Maybe has a tinge of smell but nothing strong. We use for it for every nappy change and will buy again.	&&&
Our family loves these wipes--they're the only ones we buy. The are useful all day long, even after you're done with diapers. Perfect for wiping faces, noses, hands. Absolutely essential. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Awesome product definitely recommend to some friends and family	&&&
Best brand of wipes my family & I have used. Even our friends have bought them after our recommendation.	&&&
These wipes work great, my daughter was a preemie and had super sensitive skin and the hospital recommended these, We love them!	&&&
Love having these around, fast way to clean up while cooking raw chicken or just anytime you need a quick clean up.	&&&
These wipes have been great I especially like the moisture which allows cleaning baby's bottom a breeze!	&&&
I never thought that thickness would affect how well a baby wipe works but boy does it help load when you have a very messy diaper. I really really love their thickness! I have bought these wipes in the past because they were a natural alternative to what you normally see on store shelves. If you want something that's free and clear for your sensitive baby's bum than this is the wipe for you. I never need to use more than two wipes for a change unless it's an explosion of so me sort but one usually suffices thanks to the thickness. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I use these wipes primarily for my hands. The wipes have a nice scent, they are super soft, they do not dry out my hands, and they seem to clean very well. Maybe it's just the package I bought but the wipes do seem a little on the dry side and they are a bit on the expensive side. Also if you don't pull them out of the container at the right angle you end up with more than one wipe.	&&&
"These wipes were the best by far against their sensitive wipes. The sensitive wipes were rough and very similar to The Honest Company wipes. These wipes are very soft like Pampers brand. Our daughter has never had a reaction to them and we've been using them for over a year. I do recommend buying a nice wipe dispenser like OXO type. Their boxes aren't that nice and it's hard to close their refill because it looses its stickiness."	&&&
I love this stuff! It makes all my appliances look shiny, and brand new.	&&&
I use this product for my daughter's stuffy nose. Because of it being soft and wet it helps greatly with the dried up little boogies. For me it works great and therefore there is nothing negative I have to say about the product.	&&&
I like this product. They come in handy not just for diaper changing but just as handy wet wipes as well.	&&&
Always happy with these!	&&&
Doesn't wipe my puppy's dirty feet at all. The wipes are very dry and don't seem to work. I don't understand why this product has such good rating. Am I using it incorrectly?	&&&
Love these, you don't use a bunch just to get the little one clean. Live it!!!	&&&
These wipes were very oily. Will not use again.	&&&
Get ready to smell like super coconut face. These are just fine face wipes, but the coconut is a little powerful, to say the least.	&&&
"I would advise that you please look into the ingredients if you have sensitive skin and are trusting this to be the same formula as its liquid counterpart (especially given that the name and packaging is nearly identical to the bottled version).

I use and love the liquid form of this makeup remover/cleanser, and it works beautifully on my sensitive skin. I figured I'd try the wipes because I get home pretty late and would have loved the time saver. Now maybe I was wrong to assume the wipes would have the same formula as the liquid version of the same name and packaging theme, but there is still a major point I wanted to mention about the difference in ingredients.

Please note that while the liquid version is fragrance free, these wipes are NOT. They smell heavily perfumed and they burn my eyes, unlike the liquid version. I am very sensitive to fragrance, and so are many others with sensitive or rosacea skin, so I find it a huge downside that something that says its suited for sensitive skin has fragrance in it.

Liquid version ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide

Towelette ingredients: Water (Aqua), Polysorbate 20, Pentylene Glycol, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Allantoin, Centrimonium Bromide, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum)

I can understand the changes in some of the other ingredients, but not why they would decide to add fragrance to an otherwise lovely formula for sensitive skin types. I'll be sticking to the Crealine H20 Micelle solution. Who knows, maybe I can just soak some muslin cloths in the liquid version and get the best of both worlds."	&&&
good product packaged well	&&&
As Advertised	&&&
these are the best make up removing wipes I have used. I don't wear a lot of make up daily, so usually one wipe will work but on occasion I use two just to be its all off. And on days that I wear a little more eye make up, no more than 3 wipes will do the job. The material of the cloth gently exfoliates as well and leaves skin soft and prepped for nightly routine.	&&&
As a mom of four - including twins, still in diapers - I've wiped a lot of bums. I've always used a wipe warmer (for disposable wipes the Munchkin model is my favorite) but I wanted to try this one since there comes an age where no disposable wipe gets the diaper area truly clean (as in 'no more odor' clean). This does the trick in spades. I love it! After reading the reviews, I can only assume that Prince Lionheart made positive changes to their product: I've had no leaking, no mildew or mold (I don't use the pad) and the cloths are wonderful. I only use water with a drop of vinegar on the wipes and then use Honest Co.'s Soothing Bottom Wash Spray directly on my girl's bottoms. Great product, great method. Wish I'd found out about it with my first.	&&&
"These wipes are fantastic! I use these on all my devices. They are small enough to fit a few in all my bags; backpack, gym bag, desk, glasses case. You name it!

On my glasses and phone screen, cleans perfectly with no streaks. I've noticed when cleaning a laptop or computer screen, it does leave a few streaks behind. I am not sure if it is do to the surface being a little warm. It isn't bad at all. I follow it up with a microfiber cloth and my screen is in perfect shape!

Definitely go for these. You'll have them for years!"	&&&
"We purchased one of these containers 5 years ago and its still in great condition. Unlike Pampers wipes containers which tend to scrape your tender skin, the opening is soft plastic and ever so durable. The wipes inside are large and can hold a big mess. Its true that they clean like a washcloth. Less wipes, more money in your pocket!"	&&&
"For those of us who rely on this product to disinfect for Norovirus, I have some bad news. A recently published study indicates that hydrogen peroxide is basically useless against Norovirus. (Kingsley D.H. et al., Inactivation of human norovirus using chemical sanitizers, Int J Food Microbiol. 2014 Feb 3;171:94-9.)

How then, you may wonder, can the manufacturer claim the product works against Norovirus? The manufacturer's website explains that the claim of effectiveness against Norovirus is based on testing with a different virus in the same family, the Feline calicivirus. This is apparently consistent with approved protocol, but unfortunately it turns out that human Norovirus is more resistant to disinfection by hydrogen peroxide than is Feline calicivirus.

I did find, however, that Clorox makes another germicidal wipe that uses bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Sodium hypochlorite appears to be the only available disinfecting agent that reliably works against Norovirus. The downside is that there are more materials that are damaged by bleach than by hydrogen peroxide (probably including skin)."	&&&
they have no lanolin so they are perfect for sensitive skin! they also are the best value I can find.	&&&
Excellent for quick clean-ups with water is not available. I keep several packets in the car, my computer bag, and my lunch bag.	&&&
Product works well. Pampers s a good brand.	&&&
I have five kids from 3 to 14 and I have tried many different wipes through these messy years. But Huggies wipes have been the best. They are gentle on my child and yet can get the job done. I don't just use Huggies wipes for potty clean up. They make great home clean ups and the kids can help by using them, too. I can be extra thrifty and rip them in half and get twice as much. I have accidentally washed some wipes and when i got it out of the dryer I had a perfect duster cloth! I always have Huggies wipes on the go and I can't imagine not having Huggies wipes around even when all my kids are grown. My friends and I love how Huggies wipes make clean up easy! What would motherhood look like without them?	&&&
Love the big refill boxes because I don't have to purchase wipes every week. I only purchase wipes once a month. The bags that the wipes come in reseal and keep the wipes from drying out.	&&&
I love the huggies wipes, they don't feel thin or wierd (like dryer sheets) like some other companies' do (not to name names but I used to use the Pamper's Sensitive skin wipes and they felt slippery and thin), the huggies feel solid and strong while still being soft and gentle. I love these wipes and just bought a box of 5 packs!! Now we'll be all set for a little while since we use these ALL the time (wiping up high chair trays (and the adjacent floors) as well as for "Adult Potty Use" in the bathroom... I think these wipes are the only thing i use daily without exception (oh and the various diapers we try).	&&&
I love these wipes. Scent free, sturdy enough. Not any worse than named brands.	&&&
Perfect especially when you have little siblings that constantly spill things!	&&&
I love these wipes. They leave you feeling fresh and clean and have a very fresh scent	&&&
I love this product. It is gentle on my baby's skin, but is thick and cleans well. I use less wipes overall when compared to other brands!	&&&
These wipes are great. They are the most effective natural product I have used, and they don't break the bank, either.	&&&
Love this product it cleans up stains and messes well. Also it makes the house smell fresh and clean.	&&&
"Huggies wipes are durable and perfect anyway, but now they are in a convient travel size with a strap===PERFECT"	&&&
Best baby wipes I've found	&&&
"Received this as a gift. Wipes are soft and the clutch cleans easily for on the go travel."	&&&
Our favorite facial cleansing cloths!	&&&
These wipes work excellent! They are fragrance free which is nice and do not leave any after film.	&&&
Love these face wipes. I have been using them for a couple of years and cannot use anything else - as it will irritate my face.	&&&
"We love the wipes clutch. I keep a couple around everywhere for a quick wipe: on a door in our kitchen, on the stroller, in the car. Easy to grabe!"	&&&
Awesome price, long lasting wipes!	&&&
Effective at cleaning off makeup and making my face feel more fresh. Smells really nice. However, it irritates my face a little, making it feel sort of as if I've scrubbed it too hard with a washcloth for example. I may just have a sensitivity to an ingredient though.	&&&
"My favorite wipes overall. Very soft and perfect amount of moisture. I keep these boxes in the car, the diaper bag, etc."	&&&
Arrived quick but not that moist	&&&
These wipes are very convenient for touchups to leather tack at horse shows. They are quick and easy to use on the go. They store well in the grooming bag, yet are quickly accessible for any necessary last minute cleaning before entering the show ring."}},	&&&
It works well as a wipe. But it does not have the effect of removing cat dander, as it claimed. I am still allergic after wiping my cats with this stuff. And I do that very regularly.	&&&
the strips don't stick at all. They have to be secured through addtional tape. I used packing tape, but what a hassle. The tabs are just not well made.	&&&
This moisturizer and sun screen is great for my very sensitive skin.	&&&
I love the Huggies wipes!! The natural care is best for babies. I like the thickness & it cleans great!!	&&&
awesome, repeatedly. .and likely again very soon	&&&
I'm pleased with these! I have noticed a reduction in some redness, but I am not sure if I use them enough to say it's solely because of these wipes (I alternate these with washcloth/cleanser). They haven't caused any irritation though, so they are a win for me!	&&&
does the job	&&&
I was so excited when I saw these because they are so different from any other kind of face wipe. I got the charcoal (I have sensitive, dry skin) but they don't irritate me. The exfoliating side feels amazing! I can't wait to try the other ones too! The best face wipes I've ever used.	&&&
This is the best product out there for me , when you have IBS there is nothing better than Cottonelle for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	&&&
Love love love these wetwipes. We have tried so many other brands before we stuck with pampers. They are gentle on my daughters sensitive skin and they are just wet enough to get her clean. They arent soaked and dripping in chemicals like most of the other brands. These are perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I absolutely love pampers wipies. Even the non sensitive are beyond soft compared to other brands. The sensitive are great for newborns or babies who have rash breakouts. The only downside to the sensitive wipies is that they do not work well with wipe warmers other than that they are great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I'm very happy with this order, the box is exactly as on the photo, I received that within 15 days, I highly recommend the seller, thank you :)	&&&
These are great for when I pump at work! Very convenient!	&&&
Honestly, I use these even if I'm not wearing makeup. They leave your skin looking and feeling amazing!	&&&
We have used this brand since our daughter was born. it is very good and can do many things.	&&&
These face wipes are the absolute best. Some of the face wipes out there are too dry or rough on your face, these are great. Recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These charcoal wipes are good. They remove makeup, dirt, oil, and all the bad stuff. They are soothing one one side, and they do not burn or irritate. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because the exfoliating side of each wipe is extremely rough. I expected some roughness, but this is kind of extreme. It works, but I don't think I'll reorder the charcoal ones because they were just too roug for me.	&&&
My husband is allergic to Pampers wipes (that were provided in the hospital). We changed to these as soon as we realized he was allergic and have had no troubles since. We love the new packaging with the click close... so it is OK if I do not keep them in a ziploc bag :)	&&&
These are fantastic wipes the best I have ever used. I bought these roughly a month ago. I must say that They take off the make up quite easy. I am able to use only one towelette instead of two possibly three on any other brand. I will definitely purchase these again they're amazing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I really enjoyed this product. I got a free sample to try and will purchase again. I have sensitive skins but it was gentle, yet effective in getting the makeup off. No weird smells or textures. And not too oily, which is a problem I have with other wipes.	&&&
I really like these make up removal wipes. They take all my eye makeup off	&&&
Great toilet tissue not expensive lasts longer so you never run out	&&&
"I leave this in my living room so that we don't always have to bring baby to his room to be changed. Very convenient, love it"	&&&
Love these wipes.... with a newborn born this summer no rashes and easy to bring anywhere packaging.	&&&
Amazing! Have been using them on with my son since he was born, he is getting ready to turn 4 in sept. Never broke out in a rash while we used these.	&&&
I'm a Purell product fan when it comes to sanitizing hands. I like these better than the best-selling brand wipes because they seem effective and gentle without harsh chemical fragrances. I can't imagine using those brands on my face, and these I have without any rash, redness or stinging. I'd buy these in the future - ALL THREE Fragrances.	&&&
These are great wipes- especially for babies with diaper rash or sensitive skin. :)	&&&
Love these wipes!No chemicals,biodegradable and clean very well	&&&
"I used the product as directed and it worked very well as a temporary fix, but it burned a little after first applying it."	&&&
"These wipes feel really nice compared to other brands, but they are not at all flushable. ""Flushable"" wipes should break into little bits after some time in water, similar to toilet paper. These do not -- they act more like piece of cloth.

If you do flush them down the toilet, what happens next depends on the condition of your house's sewer pipe. If you have a new, wide smooth pipe it will go through and you'll probably never be bothered. But if you have an old crumbly pipe with roots or rocks or irregularities in it, these will get caught and you'll end up with sewage flooding the basement.

And yes, sadly, I know this from experience. :)"	&&&
"Ideal for desk, phone, & hands."	&&&
I'm not particularly found of these wipes. They are very hard to separate and are too flimsy. I much prefer the Hands Down Nail wipes and even gauze squares.	&&&
The floormate works great. It does a good job and is worth the cost..	&&&
For the Medela pump, two bottles, two horns, and two breast shields fit perfectly while still being able to close the lid (weighted part removed). It fit perfectly inside my Medela pump backpack.	&&&
I love the mickey mouse wipe case. I just wish a baby bag was sold at the store to match.	&&&
Look good. Soft. How do you wash these unbleached wipes for the first time and once dirty? Instructions not included and Oso cozy didn't reply to my email.	&&&
Pampers wipes are better than Huggies. Hands down. Problem the best wipes out there but you pay for it. I would buy again.	&&&
These are the best wipes for face and hands. I have been using them since my son was a baby and he is now almost five. They really clean well and I couldn't live without them!	&&&
Hands down, these are the most gentle, natural, soothing and resistant wet wipes I know. We keep a package in each bathroom. Highly recommended!!	&&&
My 2.5 year old son recently developed a sensitivity to the wipes that I have been using on him since he was born... I used them a couple times to clean up a leaked diaper, and both times he developed a terrible red, spotty rash on his torso and legs. Poor kid. So I immediately went online to search for some natural wipes that did not contain all the alcohol and preservatives that most "mainstream" wipes do. The Clearly Herbal wipes got excellent reviews so I ordered them, and I am very happy I did. My son has not had a rash since I switched to these, and they work very well. They are a little bit drier then his old wipes, but I am willing to deal with that in exchange for a happy baby! Plus we both like the smell a lot better than the other ones. I will definitely continue using these.	&&&
Other brands of wipes give my poor daughter a rash on her bum. Huggies Natural Care is the only way to go!	&&&
Works great...great easy clean up	&&&
"This product is a great value, I have it currently on Subscribe and Save and you can never have enough. I have them on my desk at work along with almost every room in the House. Lysol is a great name and a good price. The material is thick and does not rip or break through when cleaning.

Unfortunately I have no way to tell whether or not they actually are cleaning, but hey I don't have the plague so I guess that's something!"	&&&
I have tried many brands including name brand and store brand. These are by far the softest and strongest wipes I have bought. Plus they smell great!	&&&
Gentle on my babies bottom! Smell clean. Best wipes out on the market!	&&&
Love pampers wipes! its the only wipes we buy!	&&&
The only thing I don't like about these wipes is that they easily tear. I normally buy baby wipes and I will go back to them. They are cheaper and don't tear.	&&&
I teach yoga, pilates, boot camp, kickboxing and aqua fit. My classes are tough and we sweat! This is the only deodorant that works for me even when I am teaching back-to-back classes. I am also vegan so this was such a relief to find. I have not been able to find any other deodorant that doesn't test on animals with cruelty free products that actually WORKS until Pacifica. Thank you!	&&&
Couldn't be happier with this product. It held up to all my expectations	&&&
Unfortunately pampers sensitive was not good for our daughter. We have to use a chlorine free and scent free	&&&
I wish I could give this product 10 stars. I have struggled for 2 years to clean my fridge and make it shine. My cousin recommended these and they do not disappoint. Like the other reviewers I wish I would have taken a before and after shot. Just wipe fridge down with these and use a dry cloth to polish. My fridge looks brand new. I have passed on a tub of these to several friends because they are so awesome. Do not hesitate to purchase these.	&&&
Great washcloths! My baby loved them, they did not irritate her in any way) I would recommend buying a few and keeping them in different places (home, car, work)	&&&
Love these wipes! I also use nasal saline but these wipes are gentle and easier to use for little noses with boogies. And best of all my baby doesn't seem to mind them. I think they actually feel soothing on her irritated nose.	&&&
"These are the wipes I have and they have worked well for us however they doubled in price since I bought them in October... The OZOCozy brand got similar reviews are are cheaper.

The texture of the flannel wipes is perfect: They are soft but grab poo unlike the disposable wipes which have very little texture. The decorative stitching has started to unravel on some but I don't mind because the fabric doesn't seem to fray at all.

These fit perfectly in my Prince Lionheart wipes warmer. (Which makes diaper changes much nicer. Cold wipes= crying baby) I make a wipe solution for 30 wipes with 2c warm water (PURIFIED, NOT TAP), 1 tsp each of olive oil, baby wash and baby lotion. I wet them all and keep them in the wipes warmer for 3-4 days and they don't get musty. Works for us!

Hint: If your wipes do get musty, try boiling your water first."	&&&
A must have at your office desk during flu season. Safe enough for daily use.	&&&
I like Pampers sensitive wipes because they help prevent rashes and redness. They are nice and thick which helps when you need it most:)	&&&
These are convenient to use but have an odd fragrance. Once you wipe off the cpap and put it on, you notice the fragrance, but it quickly disappears. Not a reason to avoid them but the fragrance could be improved.	&&&
I use these for two reasons: general cleanliness and treatment of hemorrhoid. I like to make sure I'm clean after "the go", and these are great for that. I found out the hard way that I am allergic to another brand of adult wet bathroom wipes (sounds like Kotenelle), but these wipes are safe for me. I also use for hemorrhoid relief. For travel, the Preparation H Totables (single packs) are great.	&&&
"Positives: Slim design for good fit in diaper bag. Sturdy and well-made.

Negative: The purpose of having this is to have moist wipes in your diaper bag and the WIPES DRY OUT in this dispenser. They need to revise the design with a rubber gasket around the openings. When on-the-go, and your baby is naked on a public restroom changing table, the last thing you need is to open your wipes and see that they're all dried out. I suppose if you use them very often and replace frequently you wouldn't mind this."	&&&
excellent quality and service, i order again	&&&
Perfect to wipe for runny nose	&&&
"I like to put these in the Huggies wipe dispensers and they work great! They're a little thinner than the scented ones (I'm not sure why - I think the thicker ones are better) but for a baby that's more sensitive to the other types of wipes these are great! You just have to use more of them."	&&&
"The product really did work very well.
Its the best i have ever used."	&&&
"We bought this to use on our newborn bc he doesn't like to get his diaper changed. He gets fussy when he is cold and felt a wipe warmer would help. The warmer works well and I do think it has helped. My only critique is that the part of the wipe that is waiting to be used next doesn't stay warm unless it is stuffed back inside the base. So, the first wipe you pull out 1/2 is warm and 1/2 isn't."	&&&
Works great!	&&&
it is easy to use and I like the material is soft. The most important thing is not mess	&&&
On time and as advertised.	&&&
"Though that the wipes work really well and were gentle."	&&&
This is just okay, but its kinda dry. I know the price of this wipes is more cheaper than the leading brand.	&&&
Great product & fast shipping!	&&&
It smells great. I think the wipes are too small. You can quickly go through a container of them if you aren't careful.	&&&
These are really great wipes. They were really gentle ony daughters sensitive skin and it seemed to me to be thicker than most other wipes which made clean ups easier. Great purchase.	&&&
Simple, basic wipes. No fancy containers or flip top lids. Eco-friendly, less packaging. Does the job.	&&&
Great product	&&&
"Love the Natural Care Huggies to begin with and absolutely love the Pooh design--it matches my son's room."	&&&
I have used the liquid bottle form of this product for a while and it works wonders at removing makeup (even heavy duty, really thick, waterproof mascara). I decided to give the wipes a go, but I will not be purchasing them again. They will NOT get my eye makeup off completely and leave smudges of black that literally just won't wipe away. I am very confused since the liquid product works SO well, but either way: buy the liquid form. Same price and lasts MUCH longer!	&&&
"love the design and the material of the wipes! my baby girl love them because they are soft! and I love the clutch because it looks great! :)"	&&&
I do love these, just bought some more this morning. I got the shaebutter kind to try this time....my son who is 5 loves these and I never worry if he is fresh and clean or not!	&&&
Love huggies wipes. They are easier to wipe my babies butts.	&&&
"Great Wipes, works well for sensitive skin."	&&&
Love them, soft and strong wipes for my baby.	&&&
Working in a photography studio, makeup wipes are our best friends. Having tried many brands, this one takes the lead for ultimate softness , pure cleaning and a comfortable finish for a flawless face.	&&&
Wipes with no chemicals makes a big difference on the hiney! These are the best wipes!!!!!	&&&
These wipes are great. I actually cut them in half because the wipe is pretty large, too large for my little baby's butt. I cut them in half and put them in the OXO tot PerfectPull Wipes Dispenser and I don't have the problem of them drying out. Although the wipes that I keep in my diaper bag I keep in a zip lock baggy because the tab on the package wears fast and exposes the wipes.Other than that I love these wipes. I got a sample of some pamper wipes and used one on my hand and they were greasy. Yuck! I threw them away. This are clean.	&&&
These do a good job of cleaning the crud off of messy hands, but the scent is very strong. Not lemony/citrusy, but very much like pina colada!	&&&
It's Meguiar's, need I say more?	&&&
I clean houses for a living, and I use the disinfecting wipes to clean outside of toilets, and I also wipe down door handles and other things that need disinfecting quick. They work great, I wouldn't use anything different.	&&&
Very very soft!!! They have a thousand uses besides babies!	&&&
Used this product for several years and found the individual wipes much more convenient than carrying a bottle of liquid sanitizer. To my dismay my local Sams quit carrrying and I had to order on line. Great product! Hope it's never discontinued.	&&&
I love Lysol wipes. I use them constantly. Having them on the Subscribe and Save is awesome. Now I don't have to think about buying them, they just show up! and the discount doesn't hurt either!	&&&
"Huggies wipes are perfect for our family! Obviously we use them for all diaper changes, but we also use them to clean up messes when we are on the go. We love these wipes!"	&&&
"This is one of my favorites since newborn baby. will buy these again and again. I carry them to clean our hands through out the day. The kids don't cry when watching their faces and hands because the wipe is too harsh wiping their faces. I love these wipes!"	&&&
These wipes are so much better than Toilet paper for my child. We also love that they are laughable. A great value.	&&&
If some of your ancestors are from Ireland or other certain northern climes there is a good chance that your will get some form of facial redness or rosacea as you come into middle age. I just figured it was something you just had to deal with with aging, and was not interested in taking any prescriptions to try to get rid of it, as I already taken enough pills like blood pressure treatments, etc. Then I read online that this cream has the reputation of helping to clear rosacea. It is amazing, it actually works! I started putting it on my face before bedtime and it rather quickly cleared up my skin from the redness. After a while it seemed to have calmed my skin down, so that I don;t even put it on everyday, though I am prepared to do so if it gets red again. It really seems to have actually "calmed" my skin. Amazing, truly. It's a bit pricey, but actually a little goes a long way, and when I put it on, it only takes two dabs to cover my whole face. Great product! Wow!	&&&
Compared to all other wipes we have tried, we love these ones the most. We have narrowed it down to these being our favorite. I like that they're fragrance free and I love the feel of them. I like that they are nice and soft too.	&&&
"My wife and I recently moved into a new home that was outfitted with all stainless appliances. I saw this as a negative, as stainless can be a pain to keep looking nice.

I originally picked these up at a big box store(prior to finding them here) hoping they would make the task easier. They do work very well and I don't have an issue with them streaking or leaving residue.

The thing that I don't like is the smell. I wonder if we could get the same performance in an unscented version"	&&&
"Don't buy!
I bought these after I ran out of the old Kirland brand. The old ones were bigger and flushable."	&&&
I bought these wipes primarily for travel. I throw a few in my purse, and then as soon as we board the plane, we wipe down the tray table, armrests, etc. They are not as harsh as other wipes in that you don't have to wash your hands after using them.	&&&
These are the only wipes that don't give my little one a rash. They work well too, thick enough and not too wet or too dry.	&&&
Great easy product to use. Cleans but doesn't leave a harsh smell after the fact.	&&&
The new formula STINKS! We've been using these wipes for over one year and we chose them because they had no smell and no residue. I'm returning this box. Please bring back the old formula or find a way to get rid of the awful smell. Until then, I won't be buying them.	&&&
This product is okay for travel - I like it because it's reusable, but it doesn't seal completely so your wipes will slowly dry out after a week or two. Most of them time I use the wipes frequently enough that it is not a problem, but it would be nice to have a complete seal.	&&&
It is a wonderful product to help in the control of facial redness. Like the SPF too as you know your face is protected from the sun on a daily basis.	&&&
CARRY THEM IN MY PURSE ALL THE TIME. great FOR WIPING SHOPPING CARTS AT STORES THAT DON/T SUPPLY THEM LIKE COSTCO.	&&&
"I like the designer tub, because baby likes to grab and throw the container while mommy is busy wiping. Unlike the store brand's lidded box, the Huggies designer package hasn't broken yet."	&&&
These are amazing! So glad I found them. They are the only thing my daughter lets me wipe her face with! They are great for boogies but also messy faces and crusty eyes.	&&&
Really like how they come out of the package easy enough once you figure out to use the towel on the outside (I think) to start the process. These don't have a strong odor and certainly don't smell like Lysol or bleach. I love to use them to quickly wipe down items in the bathroom. They have a slightly abrasive texture to clean well. Very nice and quick when expecting company. Great price too. I do like the smell as well. :)	&&&
"I bought these Pacifier Wipes for my youngest Grandaughter, who is always dropping it on the floor! You DEF DO NOT NEED to put a Pacifier back in a babies mouth unless you wash it off! Having these wipes, no matter where we are, we can pull one out and wash her Pacifier off without having to find running water, and they are always handy. We will buy them again and again!
Our service was great! Check out person was awesome!"	&&&
"This product is perfect! when we're out and about, my daughter always throws or drops her pacifier, I always had to get a water bottle to clean it off. The wipes make it super convenient to get clean."	&&&
"I had been trying to get my wife to try these out for weeks. Every time I tried, she passed on the opportunity. Clearly, she didn't believe they'd work as well for her as the tried and true spray bottle and rag. I know it will give many readers great pleasure to read that after trying them myself, I had to admit, once again, that she was right. When will I learn? Never. I'm like most men--overconfident, stubborn, and determinedly stupid.

Most of us have used baby wipes or sanitizing wipes at some point in our lives. Admit it, guys. You change diapers now. We all do. So the concept of a wet wipe for cleaning windows and mirrors makes sense. In fact, when I saw this product, I thought I'd love it. What could be easier? Just dispense, wipe, and toss. Unfortunately, this was an unfulfilled dream.

My experience with these wipes was brief and frustrating. First, the solvent in them isn't that strong. The bathroom mirror gets unmentionable material on it that usually comes off pretty easily with window cleaner, but not with these wipes. I found myself scrubbing and scrubbing to remove marks, but the worst part wasn't the elbow grease required. The worst part was the annoying particles the cloth left all over my mirror. After cleaning the mirror, I had to go back and wipe again all over the place to remove fine particles. This is completely unacceptable for a window cleaning product.

There's only one logical thing to do with these wipes--give them to my mother-in-law."	&&&
I am the type who must have facial wipes at all times. I have gone through every brand I can think of the rule being they must be organic, or natural meaning no chemicals. These facial wipes by Josie I love. They make my face feel moisturized and clean when i'm away from home and unable to do my face wash regimen. All traces of make up are gone , skin feels dewey and fresh, no burning or drying my skin out. I will use again like most all of Josie's products.	&&&
great product	&&&
I love this wipe container. It is durable and large. Works great for what I need it for! Love oxo products!	&&&
works with solid pieces, but too hard to get into any kind of design.	&&&
Have tried several brands. The volunteers that clean our church prefer this brand. It doesn't have a strong bleach oder and cleans.	&&&
Works, would definitely buy again	&&&
Great for facial wipe down at the end of the day. Cheaper by $3 than Walmart	&&&
"This huggies wipe pouch, is convenient easy to grab and go easy to refill. The ziploc type sealer works without any problems. The wipes stay moist. The only thing i wish this pouch had would be a little slit for a diaper or two then it would be my go to for short outings. I do love the color scheme of them not to feminine or masculine, just perfect for the mom and the dad to carry. This item will be in my gift for every baby shower to come...."	&&&
Will never order again it was so hard to get the wipes out and stay out.	&&&
I have used many different brands of makeup wipes in the last few years for night time (initial makeup remover before a brief cleanse n moisturizer) before bed. I used to use the Olay regenerist ones I would get for free years ago from Ulta points before they changed to this awesome new program n thought it was normal for my eyes to burn after use! Then I used Philosophy ones during a special they were a little better but price wise not worth it. I started researching n looking at more natural type brands n tried out these Simple ones. They really are the ONLY ones that don't feel greasy afterwards OR BURN MY EYES! my skin is semi dry and sensitive so I pay attention and judge products pretty badly lol so I have now gone through 3 packs of these babies YAY :-)!	&&&
"My daughter had dipaer rash with other diapers but not as bad when we used these"	&&&
Love these!! Great to know there aren't added chemicals.	&&&
Easy to use and it is a great product to have in your fur kids first aid kit.	&&&
"Love these wipes. My kids both have sensative skin and we have never had an issue. I always purchase these for soon to be moms."	&&&
"My son is three weeks old and I have been using this product since birth. This product is gentle and hopoallergenic on his sensitive skin and doesn't tear easily. I love that each wipe pack is individual so I can refill my diaper warmer and/or tub easily. Even though these wipes are more expensive then generic brand, they are worth the extra money!"	&&&
It take all the makeup and mascara.	&&&
Love these wipes. The hospital gave us the Huggies Natural wipes but after he had peed and pooped several times in a row causing his bottom to start looking too red I switched over to these and haven't had any issues since (he's now 12 days old). They do stick when trying to take them out, but I've had this issue with all wipes we've tried (this is our second child). I've never had to use more than 3 wipes to clean him up, and normally one is enough.	&&&
Love this container - easy to open, easy to refill, and it keeps wipes nice and moist. At first I took the wipes out of their package but then I realized it works just as well if I just drop a whole pack of wipes in and take off the opening seal.	&&&
I love the sensitive pampers wipes. They are gentle, no scent,easy for bottom or hands and mouth. They clean very well and leave no residue or film	&&&
great product by Neutrogena. Smell is not too harsh and does a great job removing make up	&&&
One packet of the wipes has been broken when I received it.	&&&
"Product is very functional for on-the-go use. Easier to use, fits more, and more flexible than the hard plastic travel wipes cases. The included wipes are soft and strong. The case is easy to refill."	&&&
These really are relaxing and are my favorite facial wipes.	&&&
Love this product! Using everyday!!! Love the smells and clean pretty good!!	&&&
Love these keeps my babies clean and smooth. Not one single rash. Plus they smell great! Hold together well.	&&&
Cleans well great product!	&&&
"GREAT
FOUND OUT YOU CAN CUT EM IN HALF
THE UNUSED HALF WILL STAY MOIST FOR DAYS
IF YOU FOLD IT BACK UP IN ITS PACKAGE
200 EQUIL 400"	&&&
"This is just the ticket. I have seven years of grime on my travertine tile. I will have to go slow, but I this is working very well. I wish that I had bought this in the first place. This was easy to assemble even for a mechanical idiot like myself.

I need to find out where to buy the cleaner here in Puerto Rico."	&&&
"We have tried lots of wipes and these have the softest and most cloth-like feel. The are thick and effective AND still gentle on the little ones bottom."	&&&
"I would highly recommend these wipes to anyone that wants a high quality, moist, thick, nice smelling, sensitive skin baby wipe."	&&&
We bought this for my newborn son and we love it. He would cry with cold wipes but now it's pleasant to change his diaper. Plus the built in light is great for those midnight changes	&&&
"I don't know why others rated these so low, they are an absolute favorite of ours! They are extra thick, not slimy like other brands, and when your baby is really little you can tear them in half to make them go further!! They really are the best!"	&&&
Best product ever. I've worn glasses for 43 years and my lenses have never been so clean.	&&&
There worth every Pennie! These are great for your dirty clean ups! Worth the price!!	&&&
"I love the natural care baby wipes because it is great on my baby daughter's delicate skin. It is difficult to find wipes and diapers that can be used on babies with eczema but I have found that these wipes are the perfect wipes to use for her and do not irritate her skin,"	&&&
"We bought this for my newborn son and we love it. He would cry with cold wipes but now it's pleasant to change his diaper. Plus the built in light is great for those midnight changes"	&&&
I USE HUGGIES NATURAL CARE UNSCENTED WIPES ON MY BABY GIRL. THEY'RE GREAT! STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE MESS, BUT GENTAL ENOUGH FOR HER SENSITIVE SKIN.	&&&
"I get compliments from everyone who sees this, and several have bought one. It is easy to use and refill, and it keeps the wipes moist unline plastic containers. I love it!! It is also adorable, and comes with my favorite brand - Huggies :)"	&&&
"The only wet wipes I could use on my son as an infant!! All others would make him breakout even though they were labeled "sensitive"."	&&&
Honestly it's a bit difficult to get some make up remover wipes that don't irritate my skin. What I like about this is there no fragrance added Bc I that's what irritate my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We us cottonelle totlet products always are family has very senitive skin , some other co. We don't us any more.	&&&
This stuff works really good!!!!! I love it	&&&
Really enjoying this product. Removes stubborn make-up fairly quickly. Mascara takes a bit of effort to remove, but all-in-all, it does the job without straining the face. Have purchased this 2-pack twice now.	&&&
Most wipes are too wet and leaves rashes, however these are perfect.They don't leave my daughter wet in her diaper after a long period of time. They smell great and clean very well.	&&&
These are my favorite product to use, easy, fast, and very convenient.	&&&
These are incredibly soft! I've only washed, folded, and put them away in anticipation of the arrival of our little one, but they are unbelievably soft! I can't wait to use them!	&&&
These are the only wipes I will use. My first son, no matter what we used, his butt would always become raw, red, and almost blistered. I ended up switching to cloth diapers thinking that was the problems, but the problem persisted. Soon I realized it was maybe the baby wipes so switched to cloth wipes which I used for a while, but for convenience (and because my husband was home with him while I went away playing army and doesn't want to deal with cloth anything, plus disposable is easier while traveling) I tried these and he didn't have any problems. Even when my parents would watch my son and would use a different brand they would irritate him again. I don't know what's NOT in these wipes, or what the formula is, but these were the only disposable wipes I found to not irritate him. After I had my now 15 month old I went straight to these wipes from the beginning and he had 1 issue with diaper rash the entire time. Which is great, especially since he goes to daycare.	&&&
"The hospital where our baby was born strongly encouraged the use of dry wipes with warm water (no commercial brand wipes), which we stuck to for the first 6 weeks but honestly became such a pain. Then we switched to WaterWipes and haven't looked back. They get everything nice and clean, and I love that I can wipe her face and hands and not worry about chemicals in her mouth.

I keep them in an Oxo wipe holder, and I recommend letting the wipe holder air out every so often between adding a new pack to avoid any small mold spots. My daughter is now four months and has had no issues with diaper rash. We do a combination of cloth during the day and disposable at night, and we use these wipes for both.

I never thought I'd be writing a 5 star review for wipes, but here I am. Ahh motherhood!"	&&&
The Baby washcloths are the softest baby washcloths i have ever used. They feel great when cleaning the babys face and body. I try to purchase organics products as much as possible and I love the fact that the baby washcloths are organically grown. The colors also look great! Excellent idea for a baby gift such as a shower or misc present. I will buy again. I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.	&&&
Super cute yet very useful. Very soft cloths. Makes a great gift.	&&&
Great product. Great service.	&&&
Very happy. Fast delivery, good packaging, and just what I wanted.	&&&
Does the job! Doesn't irritate skin or have a strong scent.	&&&
My favorite. Soft strong and cleans perfectly. Flushes great	&&&
They are durable enough for their use as long as you aren't too hard on them. they are great the whole family uses them. They go down just like toilet paper in the toilet.	&&&
Simple cleansing wipes are perfect to use both at home and on-the-go. I know that I can use one wipe to take off makeup and cleanse my face, all wrapped into one product! The Simple brand is one I know and trust to be gentle on my skin and nourish it back to health. It's moisturizing, has a fresh scent, and takes of all traces of unwanted make up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I have been a huge Simple lover for awhile now. I have had a lot of their other products. These facial wipes are a god sent. I have oily skin and acne still sadly. This gets all of my makeup off and does not leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky!	&&&
The wipes leave your face soft and clean the make up fast! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These make pumping at work so much easier. Instead of sterilizing after each use, I ise these wipes and only have to sterilize at the end of the day. I am so much more efficient!	&&&
these are handy wipes they clean well it makes cleaning quick	&&&
I've always used regular baby wipes to wipe my sons hands and face while out to dinner or running errands Or after being at the park but I started to realize he was getting dry skin around his mouth! Found these and have not had a problem since!! They smell good are good for his sensitive skin and work very well!! I will buy this product over and over again!	&&&
Living in the north pole aka Chicago we found that our poor children were becoming fussy every time we changed them, so we bought the wipe warmer and since then no issues. Keep wipes warm enough but takes a bit too long to warm up. Every time we replace wipes we have to wait about an hour to use. Worth buying if you live any where the weather is disgusting cold.	&&&
These wipes are great. I wish the smell was not so powerful.	&&&
Before buying these, we had been using baby wipes when wiping our son's nose. He has sensitive skin and he would break out if we used baby wipes too much. I often made fun of this product before my husband bought them, but now I see why they were made! Will be buying these until my son can wipe/blow his own nose."	&&&
I bought this on a whim after not wanting to fiddle with my wipes package containers anymore. I'm so glad I did! Easy to use, keeps the wipes fresh and moist, and a clean, simple design. I love it so much I bought one for my MIL who keeps my daughter at her house during the week.	&&&
I been using them since my baby was born and so far I'm pleased, this are my favorite for sure.	&&&
This large box of baby wipes is economical and handy. In addition to the refill packages, the box also contains a wipe container.	&&&
I thought that purchasing Windex Original Glass and Surface Wipes would make cleaning easier and faster. I was wrong. I picked these up at my Walmart for a pretty great deal of $4 and having a $.50 coupon, I was not hesitant to throw them in the cart. It finally came time to clean windows from all the fingerprints. I pulled a wipe and got started. I thought, "Wow, these things are great at removing finger prints!" But a couple seconds later when the windows dried, STREAKS! I was so angry, and because I walked away and started on the next window, I had done all the living room windows before I realized that these things were streaking like crazy! I recommend the regular spray! However, I rate these a five instead of one because I used the rest of the package (instead of throwing it away and wasting) to clean and dust my ceiling fan blades. Which does work wonderfully!	&&&
These are pretty standard screen wipes, standard size, standard job, standard cost. After I have wiped my screens I then use the wipes to clean the keyboard then progress to the telephones, etc.	&&&
My Daughter has some minor irritation in her diaper area and these wipes are delicate on her sensitive skin. They don't have any scent at all, and clean up well.	&&&
"These are our favorite wipes, for sure. Fragrance free, alcohol free, super sensitive, very moist, don't dry out easily, and very soft.
And from here, a great buy (and convenient)"	&&&
I have been using these wipes since I had my daughter 10 years ago! I now have a 8 month old and these continue to be my preferred choice of wipes. I haven't liked ANY other wipes I've tried.	&&&
I don't like how the wipes came out. Some time its hard to get one piece, other times its too easy to get too much...	&&&
If you're looking for a beautiful set of extremely soft washcloths this is it! Great gift idea for families with newborns.	&&&
convenient wet wipes. these are handy to clean all around the home. scented perfectly a plus. glad I purchased these. all is quickly sanitized, in a snap!! thanks ...	&&&
Bigger than most wipes and do not dry out as quickly as wipes packaged in paper. In the past was able to purchase IN-STORE. However have only been able to purchase on-line. Would like to see them available IN-STORE again.	&&&
"Bamboo baby washcloths, need more be said??? I have come to love Bamboo anything! It is so soft and perfect for a baby! Babies have very sensitive skin, so they need to have soft washcloths and towels used on them. These washcloths are not only soft as ever, but they are extremely absorbent! They are anti-bacterial and anti-fungal and hypoallergenic! I am going to have to be honest and admit that I stole the purple one’s out of this set for myself! They are too amazing to pass up!
The set comes with three colors: white, green, and purple!
These are PERFECT for anyone, infant to adult, who has sensitive skin! These help sooth my itchy skin from acne.

Received at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
5/5 stars!!!"	&&&
"I ordered three different bamboo baby wipes and thought these would be my favorite. They were soft and just the right thickness. However, after the first wash and dry cycles, before I had a chance to use them, five of the six cloths were badly unraveled at the edges. The one cloth that did not fray had an unraveled thread in the body of the cloth. The other two brands came out of the same wash and dry cycles looking and feeling perfect.
This 'bamboo organics' Bamboo Baby brand is of poor quality and I do not recommend them. Perhaps I received a bad batch, but I won't chance a replacement. These are going back for a refund."	&&&
We love!! It closes easily and fit enough wipes for our trips.	&&&
Better than a Kleenex or wipes , plus it doesn't make babies noses red , and keeps nose with a little moisturizer .	&&&
I love these wipes. They are the only wipes i have used and will use for my son. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Perfect for runny noses. My daughter (7) appreciates the gentleness and the scent of wipe. Feel better armed in battling cold symptoms when I have these!	&&&
I love these for household use. Wife uses them to wash dishes. They are tough and reusable. We don't buy paper towels. Beats even then best paper towels don't hold a candle to these. Lasts a long time. Huge roll. Highly recommend for anyone tired of cheap paper towels.	&&&
I wouldn't buy this again. It's very hard to open the flap to get wipes out (even without a baby nearby). And at one point the flap ended up breaking off. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money.	&&&
These wipes are gentle on a baby's sensitive bottom. They don't cause diaper rash. I've been using them since our baby was 1 month old and we've had no irritation whatsoever. The only complaint I'd have is the price tag and they do tend to dry out quickly. Beyond that, I'd highly recommend them.	&&&
My son is three weeks old and I have been using this product since birth. This product is gentle and hopoallergenic on his sensitive skin and doesn't tear easily. I love that each wipe pack is individual so I can refill my diaper warmer and/or tub easily. Even though these wipes are more expensive then generic brand, they are worth the extra money!	&&&
Love these wipes! soft and have a good smell.	&&&
"Works great for stuffy, runny noses!"	&&&
Great value and I like these so much better than wipes in a container that usually dry out. Take them to work, leave them in the car and when we go out to eat.	&&&
This is the most beautiful and useful wipes package ever seen.	&&&
"Love the scent and durability of these. They hold up better than any other wipes and the scent is not too strong."	&&&
Even though I think this wipes are expensive compare to others in the market..I wouldn't choose any less for my baby delicate skin...	&&&
I purchased this product because of the Kirkland name and the price. After I came home I read the reviews and almost took them back - what a mistake that would have been! They are really nice: larger than Huggies, no scent, and individually folded, no sticking together. Unless they have been changed since the last review I read I wouldn't return these in a heartbeat .	&&&
We having been using these for s good while They are durable and can't beat the price.	&&&
These are the best for cleaning glasses. I used to wash mine under the faucet with a drop of detergent on each lens. That also works well but is much more tedious than using pre-moistened wipes. What I especially like is that they don't leave smudges or residue - just a couple of wipes across each lens and they're clean as a whistle.	&&&
I recently adopted a 15 year old senior pug from our local shelter, and while he is housebroken, he does want to mark his territory by dribbling. These are the perfect way to keep my floors and furniture safe from him!! Great product!!	&&&
"I love these wipes! They are super soft and wipe so clean! They aren't too wet which I don't like for my daughter. They seem to rip easily but it may be because of how I pull them out of the dispenser. But since the wipes aren't so wet, it makes them less cold when I wipe my daughter since I don't have a wipe warmer. These wipes are great."	&&&
I absolutely love Burt's Bees products for both myself and children. When I saw the wipes, I immediately put them in my cart. Coming home from the hospital with my second child they were the first wipes we used. So disappointed! The wipes are EXTREMELY hard to get out of the container, not the best scenario at 3am. They are have given my daughter slight irritation on her bottom. Sadly we will not be buying again.	&&&
Perfect for throwing in your purse or man bag / briefcase and backpack. We use on our eyeglasses and smart phones. Handy to have around.	&&&
"The wipes come packages together 100 per package. The package isn't resealable, meaning if you stick this in your bag, lint and dust and dirt will find it's way into it. That said, I've found that taking a few out and putting them into a small zip lock baggie will keep them handy and lint free.

For their use, they work very well and provide a quick method to cleaning your lens while on a shoot."	&&&
When my kids get colds, I always go buy a pack a these. They are very moist so its easy to wipes kids noses with. The saline in them helps my kids breathe easier. The downside is that my kids hate when I try to wipe their noses with them."	&&&
These are the only wipes I will use. They are soft yet don't tear like other brand wipes. I like that they don't have any alcohol in them so they are super good on my baby's bottom.	&&&
I need less wipes to get my little ones messiest diapers clean!	&&&
My babies both have sensitive skin & these are the only wipes that meet that condition & thick enough to not feel like you are wiping with just your hand.	&&&
"Not just for babies, every household should have these in their bathrooms for use. Wiping your backside with toilet paper alone hasn't crossed my mind for the past 10+ years.. carry them when traveling as well.

Think about it, if you stuck your hand in poop would you be happy wiping it off with just toilet paper? I hope not, you would want to wash it.. Short of jumping in the shower or placing your behind in the sink, this is the next best thing.

Good Quantity, good price, will buy again."	&&&
I definitely appreciated the opportunity to try these wipes. They were thick and effective and got the job done in 1-2 wipes usually. I definitely loved the lack of harsh chemicals and scents! The only thing I didn't like was that they left a lot of lint behind but many things can affect that including age. Looking forward to trying again!	&&&
While I much prefer Cottonelle, I cannot always afford to purchase it. It is more expensive than most other brands & store brands. Please lower your prices and also disburse many more coupons that are easy to obtain so I, and many others, can more easily afford to buy Cottonnelle.	&&&
gets the job done painlessly	&&&
Move over Clorox- these are my new go to wipes. I loved the spray, but these are super convenient.	&&&
This product has a very strong fragrance, making it virtually unusable. I usually like Seventh Generation products, and buy fragrance free only. This was a mistake...and I bought 2 large containers.	&&&
"Baby Washcloths

Wipe away your woes.

This is the second set of Baby Washcloths we have purchased. My wife has decided to give these washcloths to her daughter-in-law as a present.

Whether you are pampering yourself or your baby, these washcloths add that Special touch.

The Baby Washcloths come with a ribbon tied around each one and make a nice decoration when arranged in a Woven Basket in the bathroom. The colors add even more to the ambiance of the setting.

If you are in need of some new washcloths (either for yourself or to be given as a gift) I highly recommend these Baby Washcloths by AngelicWare."	&&&
The Natural Care wipes are amazing! I have tried many other brands and kinds in a pinch, but these work so much better! They are nice and thick to get the job done without ripping or your fingers poking through so you need fewer at a time.	&&&
Sometimes the kids, no matter the age, need a little help making sure they are clean after going potty. We use Kandoo flushable wipes to be sure that I don't have to stain stick pants later. Perfect size for little ones, but adults can use them too. They smell nice and don't bother anyone's skin	&&&
I love these wipes! I have used them with all three of my boys and will continue too!	&&&
Great for those times where you are concerned about cleanliness! Great product, easy to use, and even greater price.	&&&
Love the 3 pack	&&&
I brought these products for my desk top computer. they worked great cleaning my touch screen and cleaning dirt and dust from keyboard. I would recommend these for cleaning your computer.	&&&
Nice, soft baby washcloths. These were a gift to a coworker and she absolutely loves them. Soft yet durable and are perfect for baby's bath time.	&&&
These washcloths are a real treat! They are really soft, absorbant, and still good for scrubbing face for deep cleaning. I use them on my face and for my kids. The colors are really beautiful and cute and would be a nice piece to add to a gift basket. Really nice that they are natural material--it really makes a big difference.	&&&
I use this product to clean my English Bulldogs' nose folds and tail pockets. Since switching to these from baby wipes, we haven't had any infected folds. I'm pleased, but my dogs aren't. The scent in these wipes makes my dogs sneeze. They now put up a fight while it is time to wipe their faces. They prefer the unscented baby wipes. I prefer fewer trips to the vet, so we are sticking with these.	&&&
"These wipes are great. Work for the nastiest of bottoms to the dirtiest hands. Would recommend to anyone. You can find cheaper but not better. The cheaper ones you will use twice as many every time."	&&&
These are amazing! I always have these under my sink and in my bathroom. Easy to use, dont have to worry about a spray bottle or using a rag, sanitizes and leaves a fresh scent!	&&&
Opened over 20 packets. All completely dried out. Tossed the rest of the box in the trash.	&&&
The best to keep my glasses clean. I tried many other methods including the sprays but when my daughter recommended these I was sold. I carry the small individually wrapped cloths in my purse and have some in my desk at the office.	&&&
"I love the cute packaging and how convenient this product is. The wipes are awesome and gentle. Most of all I love the design it stands out inside of that packed diaper bag. With out breaking the bank :)"	&&&
"Love the plastic bags. Much better than hard case. These are easy to fit in any bag. The wipes stay wet and are easy to get out of plastic. I put them in the bag that goes to our babysitters house everyday. Very convenient. Never have to refill... just throw bag away when empty."	&&&
Just buy this. When you are elbow-deep in an extremely filthy diaper, the last thing you need is for your flimsy plastic wipe container to clump wipes and fall into the floor when you're trying to jerk one out. This product eliminates all that hassle. One wipe at a time and it's weighted so it doesn't fall! I've been using this for a week now and it's so awesome! Best invention for diaper changes!!	&&&
Nice product, compared to Cliradex... less expensive and does not sting as much, but also does not seem to work as well.	&&&
I like to put these in the Huggies wipe dispensers and they work great! They're a little thinner than the scented ones (I'm not sure why - I think the thicker ones are better) but for a baby that's more sensitive to the other types of wipes these are great! You just have to use more of them.	&&&
Baby wipes are perfect for newborns and all baby's and does not irritate the skin	&&&
Works well; very expensive.	&&&
Great for travel	&&&
Not only do these wipes work well, my sons rash has cleared up. These are the best wipes especially for a child with very sensitive skin.	&&&
These wipes are great. They really help my skin to stay balanced and smooth. My skin clears up while using these wipes. It works wonders for whiteheads and blackheads. I'm a 27 year old female with a mildly oily skin type, with sporadic stress pimples on forehead. I'm a frequent buyer.	&&&
Light scent, which is ideal when you don't want your dog to smell like the perfume counter at a department store. I'm sure a dog doesn't want to smell anything on it's coat either, so these are perfect. The wipes are thick and wet enough so as to not rip with usage. The only issue that I have with it is that the lid doesn't stay shut.	&&&
the wetness is just perfect, it is very soft and east to tear off.	&&&
I loooove these. I use them after biking to work, or after a workout if I don't have time to shower. They are so soft and smell so good! I first discovered them in New Zealand, and am so happy that I can buy them here in the US.	&&&
"They were very easy to use and the kids loved the smell so much they kept wanting to wipe their noses!!"	&&&
Been using these for some time cleans well. The dispensing mechanism sucks.	&&&
used them till my boy was two! I always find these at a good deal at Amazon Mom Prime.	&&&
My skin reacts to many things which my allergist couldn't pin point to. So I need to be extremely be careful what I use on my skin. I figured this looks harmless so I bought it. I'm sure i'm a rare case but the 2nd night I used this my face felt like it was burning a little. slight burning sensation. But then so does Clinique's milk cleanser(any other Clinique I'm fine with)	&&&
very good product. quick delivery. Thank you.	&&&
I love huggies brand but the problem with these wipes are that they leave little fibers. After I have wiped my baby there are little fibers left on him.	&&&
These wipes work really great when you are starting to Potty Train. Easy for the kid to grab, and also cleans very nice!	&&&
works like it should although the first one we bought broke down after a few weeks but this works great keeping wipes warm but not hot.	&&&
This was the best deal on quality diaper whipes I could find after some shopping around and price comparison. To my suprise, they even cost less per whipe then at Sam's Club. With 2 month old twin boys, you can imagine we go through a lot of these. They get the job done and buying in bulk saves our large family of my husband, I, and 12 kids money.	&&&
In full disclosure, this is the first review I've ever written. I'm doing so b/c I'm so disappointed in the "new" formula that hopefully if enough of us not only give a poor review, but also RETURN the bad product, the old wipes will come back. I returned them right away. If you don't, the bottom line ($$$) will not be affected and the change will never be made. These wipes BURN. They are absolutely horrible. I'd been using them for years and now have had to find alternative wipes which are not as great as the old formula Costco wipes used to be. Wishing for a holiday miracle....	&&&
When you have as many electronic devices as we do, always a good idea to keep this little wipes handy.	&&&
Love these wipes! I don't think I could live without them.	&&&
"Very good, nothing wrong"	&&&
Excellent price for something I use every day. You can use one for a few days or a week more before trashing it for a new one- depending on how many times per day you use. I wash dishes in the sink so mine get a lot of use!	&&&
We were gifted one pack of these at a baby shower, and I think we used half of the pack. They work well, and do a good job, but for us it became one more thing to carry around. If we really needed to, we would wash off a pacifier in the sink and rinse it well. Worked just as well and meant less to carry.	&&&
"""I LOVE these wipes. We have been using them since day 1 with our LO. They're soft, durable, and get the job done.

I don't like Huggies diapers, as they cause diaper rash on my LO, but I will ALWAYS use these wipes."""	&&&
"I love these wipes compared to lot if other brands. The texture has the wipes feeling thick and only need to use one at a time if I'm wiping my kids pop or cleaning up my kids food mess from their high chairs or hands and face."	&&&
"""I love these wipes

keeps my baby nice and clean"""	&&&
Awsome it reduces my dry skin jksjdkfmfkfkdkffkfkfkf	&&&
"I love this clutch N' clean carrying case. It fits alot of wipes more than a regular wipe case. I have one in my purse and in my car. You can never lose it and the designs are great. Its easy to clean if it gets dirty. Getting to the wipes are easy so that you can get the job done faster."	&&&
You can get these for half price per use in a multipack BUT the individually wrapped are better. The disposable clothes are thicker. When these are used for their intended purpose the difference is obvious.	&&&
These wipes help to make you feel cleaner.	&&&
"I use the wipes every day for every day cleaning and on my kids. These wipes are natural so they are wonderful on the kids."	&&&
this are the only wipes we buy for our 2 kiddos! they are the only wipes that do the trick	&&&
"I've used these wipes since the day my daughter was born. They have helped me clean up the worst diaper messes! They are strong and wet enough to get a lot off the little bottom with one swipe. They are gentle and haven't caused any rashes for us! I'd recommend them to everyone!"	&&&
The wipe size is too small.	&&&
Really does pick up lots of stuff steamer left behind. Gross what comes from "clean" tile floor. Is noisy and time consuming. Have substituted vinegar for cleaning solution with good results.	&&&
I was a little concerned about going with a brand I didn't know, but this turned out to be a great product and a great value. The wipes are really durable, they smell great, and the dispenser is even attractive. Very handy to have around for cleaning, or when germs are a concern. Glad I got it.	&&&

I would say these are definitely the strongest wipes, but not the softest-- they can be rough if skin is very sensitive.	&&&
i love these wipes because they are super gentle and my daughter diaper rash cleared up as soon as i used these. They are great but don't have much of a smell which is fine with me.	&&&
I can't say how much I love these wipes! They are dry wipes that take smudges off everything! I use it for my camera lens, my photo scanner, my iPhone, my computer screen! With one wipe all the smudges are gone! You absolutely must buy it!	&&&
I love them, used lots of wipes and these ones are gentle on my boys bottom.	&&&
There are several different brands of len wipes on amazon. This is the one that I like. It is not too wet, but just wet enough for a thorough cleaning of my eye glasses, followed by a quick wipe of my iPhone 5s screen. The 200 count box seems to fit my usage pattern best. They do eventually dry out even within the packaging so you would not want to have 600 hanging around for a year.	&&&
never has worked to clean floors, brushes are useless. also leaks.	&&&
Love these but $24.99 per pkg is outrageous. Ultra has them $13.50 per and a buy one get one half off! Sorry Amazon, I love shopping with you usually, but definitely not for this product!	&&&
I love these face wipes! I have the beginnings of rosacea and combination dry/oily skin. These wipes have helped immensely. I just signed up for the subscription and saved some money so that is a bonus too!	&&&
The wipes are a good size to clean your laptop screen. The duster is better used a a fun air blaster; still effective at cleaning particles off the keyboard.	&&&
Nice to have for disinfecting toliet seats. Just dont flush them.	&&&
"I bought these as a gift for a couple with a baby - they seemed from the ad to tick all the boxes PLUS they look like a nice item to give as a gift. Good price too. Anyway the couple was absolutely delighted with them. Recommend buying a few for Christmas presents!

UPDATE : my wife is now using this and has ditched the baby cloth she uses to wash daily in favor of one of these. She says it is the softest wash cloth she has ever used."	&&&
I received this product complimentary for my honest review from the Simple Skincare VoxBox from Influenster. I am so impressed with these wipes compared to others, and I honestly feel that it's because they have these grooves that really get deep into the skin to get all of the makeup off. I haven't had to use more than one wipe for a full face of makeup, so I'm sure you won't run out as fast as other brands. This is also great for waterproof makeup as well, so that's really a plus!! I highly recommend his product to anyone look for reliable makeup removers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I got this product about a week ago, and it was absolutely amazing! Very gentle and clean, with a refreshing feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I never received my free sample from Generation Good but I have used these wipes before. I think they are a good product, like any other wipe but they are pretty expensive which keeps me from buying more. If they were comparable to other wipes as far as price, i would likely choose these wipes.	&&&
I started using these because other makeup removers would make my face really red these have not made my face red. They are perfect for my sensitive skin. They aren't to pricey. They take off my makeup really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We have used Huggies, Burt's bees, and pampers but these are by far our favorite. These seem to be a bit thicker so I don't have to use so many when cleaning up a big poop from our little one. I highly recommend!	&&&
I use wipes to clean up my son's high chair after meals. I'm able to get everything pretty quickly. I find I have to really scrub when using wipes on any stains on my kitchen counter however. I tend prefer a different product for those situations. It's good for a quick clean up that I know is disinfecting.	&&&
I use the wipes for everything! I always keep a package in my purse. They come in handy more times than you would think. They smell good and stay fresh.	&&&
"I bought these wipes for my 4 month old. The store had them on sale and when I got there they were sold out the management team order them for me online at the store sale price!!!!! Can you say awesome.."	&&&
I actually found these at my gym, someone put a bunch of them out for samples and i grabbed a couple. I have oily skin, these things take off all your makeup and leave your skin feeling moisturized.	&&&
has really good skin cleansers & skin treatment prevents skin disease & helps clean scratches & small cuts recommended for all wrestlers	&&&
Budget and brand buyer-if worth the price then willing to pay but love when I can save!	&&&
quality product! And the fact that it's flushable makes it very convenient to have in our bathrooms, mainly for the kids.	&&&
They smell wonderful and clean nicely!	&&&
We've used these wipes since my son was first born. They have always worked great and never caused any irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Works well. Great price.	&&&
I loved these cleansing cloths. They felt so soft on my skin as well as easy took the makeup off of my face when using them. They didn't tear like most cloths I have used in the past. Only thing is I wish they resealed better so they didn't dry out other that great product.	&&&
I have tried a bunch of different brands of wipes and these are my favorite! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We tried 4 other brands of washcloths (swaddle designs, aden+anais, american baby company, and Gerber) prior to this, and Bamboobino is the winner of all. They are small and thin, but not flimsy at all. What I like most about them- they stay soft and don't curl up after washing, and they stay fresh (not smelly). Even though they are white, the stains wash off very well compared to other washcloths. I will definitely buy more if I have another baby.	&&&
Loved the quality it is very durable not cheap plastic. Super cute it fits with the Minnie Mouse theme. Would recommend rhis to anyone.	&&&
They work great, easy use to wipe pacifiers when there is no water around	&&&
Great product got the price. Don't like the cheap dispenser top.	&&&
I am a huge fan of these wipes, they have mild smell and they work awesome!	&&&
"Received these at a baby shower. Love the reseal bag. Keeps wipes from drying out. Wipes are soft to touch."	&&&
awesome wipes love them keep my son breakout free and clean fresh sent no rashes would recommend them to all new mommys	&&&
Great cleaning tool. Love these. Do not leave a residue and cleans up all the mess my three-year-old makes	&&&
I had my daughter about 3 months ago & I recived 2 of these at a Diaper party. I Haven't had to purchase wipes yet	&&&
Good product if you need these and very easy to carry.	&&&
I was delighted to find a twin pack of my favorite cleaning cloths. I have sensitive skin and the perfumes on other brands causes me to break out. This was a great price and I will order these again.	&&&
"""The pouch is great and definitely reusable.

The wipes are fine, they are not sensitive wipes but they clean pretty good, and not very soaky.



Every mom should buy at least one of these."""	&&&
It works, but is a bit bulky and it's hard to fit a lot of wipes in the pod. When you put a lot in, you can't pull them out of the top opening because it's too tight.	&&&
I like these wipes I just wish they where a bit thicker.	&&&
"I love these wipes and enjoy the fact they are perfume free. I like that they have less chemicals and efficiently gets the job done."	&&&
"I love the natural care because it has fewer chemicals and added stuff."	&&&
"My daughter's skin reacts to scented baby wipes, so I saw this on the shelf one day and decided to give it a try. Have not stopped using it since. Gets the job done without giving her any rashes."	&&&
This is great for travel. It's very compact and small, easy to carry. You can actually just keep one in your purse all the time. When using it, it's actually a bit too small, I wish it's a bit larger sheet instead. The quality is alright, it does clean up makeup very well. I will surely re-purchase this item.	&&&
I'm giving these wipes 5 stars, because they got 5 on the skin doctor score. The skin doctor score is a way to evaluate baby wipes for safety of the ingredients. For a comparison, of 10 different brands, check it out here: http://theskindoctor.com/2014/11/11/diaper-wipes-secrets-revealed/. Happy hunting!	&&&
Great to have on our hikes-- or kayaking for men or women-- It's nice to have as singles.	&&&
Best price on the market. I will keep ordering them. Came on time. Also came with an extra container it's great for the value.	&&&
I couldn't find these locally so ordered from Amazon. I like them although I do mostly try to use more green products (i.e., reusable cloths). I just have a dust problem around all our electronics and these work great - better than used dryer sheets or swiffer cloths. They do feel a little sticky but used sparingly, I think they are great!	&&&
This was a great find and has become necessary for me to have another level of cleanliness.	&&&
I keep these in my truck and take one in when I stop to eat lunch. Very handy.	&&&
After a year of using these I can highly recommend them.	&&&
I have ordered all my Cologne from Amazon. I thought I had the best smelling Cologne until I smelled this one. Omg this is the best smelling one I have ever owned. I will order this one again. It last a long time . Even with all this heat in New Orleans. I spray 2 shots on me after I take my shower at night and I still can smell it in the morning. Everyone that smells it on me they go crazy over how great it smells on me.	&&&
Love these. I still like the Huggies One and Done the best, but they discontinued them on Amazon. These are great - the right amount of moisture and thickness to get the job done without getting poop on your hand.	&&&
"I love having these travel packages of wipes around.
I keep them in the bathrooms & even in the car."	&&&
I love pampers diapers and wanted to exclusively buy from pampers for the most reward points. So, I switched from Huggies natural and I gotta say. They aren't has good as cleaning. I feel like that aren't absorbent at all and don't pick up a lot of what I am wiping up. Unfortunately I am going to have to switch back to Huggies natural wipes.	&&&
I started purchasing these for my babies, but now purchase them for myself. They make excellent makeup removers, especially my eye makeup. They're easy to store, handy and inexpensive. Also, they smell great and I can have them on hand for back up wipes for my boys!	&&&
Great quality wipes, stay nice and moist - I've never had one of these rip apart on me.	&&&
Must have in our house. My college age daughter steals these to take back to school with her every time she comes home. It just doesn't seem clean unless you wipe it down with a disinfectant wipe.	&&&
These wipes worked great when my baby's bottom was sensitive from a diaper rash. They were nice and soft. They were even sturdy enough for big messes.	&&&
"Both of my boys have sensitive skin. I tried this product and never changed since. My boys never had a bad reaction to these wipes. :)"	&&&
Cleans on contact. Easy on the nose even though it contains bleach. Great texture, nice and strong even when rubbing on surfaces.	&&&
nice easy to use.	&&&
Great price. Easy and fast shipment for a business owner who doesn't have time to waste.	&&&
Chlorine is a known killer of the Ebola virus - these are a good thing to have handy!	&&&
I have tried other products - this is the first one I've found that really works	&&&
I started using this product with my first child 6 years ago and now with my second child. It is sensitive enough for their delicate skin and so handy for many other uses! I even use them in my classroom for my students!	&&&
Won't need wipes ANY time soon, love the price.	&&&
Pleased with my order. Product was as described and delivered in timely manner -- packaged well.	&&&
I chose this product because both of my children have sensitive skin (what baby doesn't :)) and they both had reacted previously to other competitor products. These wipes are soft, gentle on the skin, and thick enough to handle the largest of messes. We have not and will not buy any other wipes.	&&&
"The only wipes on the market I will use!"	&&&
I bought these wipes primarily for travel. I throw a few in my purse, and then as soon as we board the plane, we wipe down the tray table, armrests, etc. They are not as harsh as other wipes in that you don't have to wash your hands after using them."}	&&&
"These are horrible, they do not tear, or have the teeth on both sides to stop the wipes from coming out. About 4-7 come out and you have to stop what you're doing and try really hard, to tear them apart. Will not be buying these again!
Better to buy in store on sale!!!"	&&&
Great stuff!!	&&&
Super soft and love the fact that it is very gentle on my baby's bottom!	&&&
I'm a fan of Nature's Miracle products, but these wipes were difficult to remove from container, came out in big chunks instead of single wipes.	&&&
I use these wipes everyone - kitchen and bath, kid's room, car, etc. They are portable and easy to use and make it a snap for the kids to help too.	&&&
Better than your regular baby washcloths, My son does not put up a fight when I have to wipe his face when he sees theses cloths coming his way. They are super soft unlike regular washcloths were they are rough. I love the fact that I can also use them as teething cloths. these are multi-purpose and absolutely wonderful, and bonus*** there organic so there are no worries that my son is sucking on hidden chemicals. Thank you Green Sprouts!	&&&
My husband and I go through these things a lot. They're great for small or big messes and don't have too much of an odor. They're great to have on hand!	&&&
Couldn't use these as they irritated my eyes/lids more than they already were. Had a second flare up 4 days after using product, none in the 6 weeks since I used them last.	&&&
I have always been an unscented wipe user of a different brand because I assumed if they're unscented then they're as gentle as can be. I decided to go ahead and try seventh generation wipes and the first thing I noticed were the ingredients. I compared it with my usual brand and my mind was blown when I saw the garbage that was in MY REGULAR BRAND! The seventh generation wipes are as natural as you can get and if anything, this experience has been an eyeopener IN regards to what is in other products. The seventh generation wipes are strong, absorbent, durable, and are the perfect size, especially for the messy diapers! I found that I am using LESS wipes because I don't need as many to get the job done. I have since switched to the seventh generation wipes. I have only one tiny Con about them and that is that they seem to leave a lot of lint behind. The benefits far outweigh that though. I would most definitely recommend to my friends and family. I was selected to try a free sample through the generation good program for testing purposes however my sample package came completely empty so I purchased them on my own. Statements made are in my opinion only	&&&
It cleans and clears up my computer so it does it's job.	&&&
used it right away and it works great. would definatley buy again	&&&
"These are good!! I wanted something to keep in the office for after lunch, when my pen explodes. I didn't want a tub of wipes, because sometimes those dry out. These are easy to keep around (and drop in my purse too).

They will be a staple for me at work."	&&&
You can trust Zeiss with all of your lens cleaning needs. These things are great and so much handier that having that bottle of cleaner in your camera bag. These things are great for cleaning lens's, phones, computer screens, glasses, etc. Great deal too.	&&&
Wipes are thick and clean up messes quickly. Use it for diapering and well as food cleanup. Love the price too.	&&&
"My daughter has very sensitive skin. These are the only wipes that don't break her out."	&&&
Delivered as expected. I am amazed out how well it cleans my glasses without any other dry wiping needed at all. It gets rid of the oils on the glasses completely. Works better than ever expected. My glasses are spotless after using the wipe.	&&&
"I love these wipes! They are gentle on the babies skin, and very durable. I hate when you go to pull a wipe from the pack and it tears or they are too damp. These are perfect!"	&&&
These wipes are great and at the price I couldn't pass it up!	&&&
I love these wipes. They smell good and don't dry out. I reused the tub with refill pack and it keeps them moist.	&&&
"Cleaned up sticky after food messes on face and hands!!!"	&&&
I love the refill container. This has saved me a lot of money. I just buy the refill packs. I have one of these containers on the changing table and one at each of the grandparents houses. Very convenient and wipes stay wet in the container.	&&&
After recently discovering that regular Clorox wipes don't kill the stomach flu I went looking for a wipe that would & came across these.	&&&
Though that the wipes work really well and were gentle.	&&&
is what it is, nice and moist not dried out.	&&&
Ok. They seem thinner and smaller than the sensitive and regular wipes. I will probably go back to those.	&&&
overpriced	&&&
"These have to be the best wipes I've used so far. So soft and clean so easily. No irritation for baby."	&&&
"I love these wipes. They smell great and have a very soothing effect on the baby. I would buy them all the time except they are a bit on the higher price side."	&&&
These wipes arrived moldy. We have ordered before & had extras so didn't see this was the case until after the return window. Customer service at Babyganics hasn't yet called us back. I actually used them without realizing the brown discoloration was mold then opened the lid & saw mold on BOTH these canisters of wipes. So much for disinfectant.	&&&
Love these wipes for my dog.	&&&
These are the best wipes that are made! They feel like real cloths and my baby with tons of allergies never reacts to them. They are the most amazing wipe on the market, hands down. Try them out, you won't be disappointed!	&&&
"Love the wipes, gentle and doesn't have an alcohol feel."	&&&
I love this product. It always makes me feel clean after. The scent isn't to strong either, which is what I like.	&&&
Wife and I only use the One and Dones since they don't rip and do a good job with one or two wipes. Don't have to worry about anything seeping through the wipe and getting to your hand since the qipes are nice a thick. Some of the more horrible messes will require more than one to get done, but for most everything else the name stays true.	&&&
These are the best wipes. They don't have an irritating fragrance, and they don't fall apart like bargain brands. By the case they're one of the most affordable too.	&&&
Great value for large qty, use these everyday	&&&
Great for traveling. Wish they would get them back in my club so I didn't have to order online.	&&&
"I love the refill container. This has saved me a lot of money. I just buy the refill packs. I have one of these containers on the changing table and one at each of the grandparents houses. Very convenient and wipes stay wet in the container."	&&&
"I have tried all different wipes and huggies are by far the best. I will never buy any other brand. They are thicker than most wipes and do not rip while you are using them. My kids have very sensitive skin and these wipes never break them out. I will always buy them."	&&&
Nice individually wrapped wipes. I used these in emergency car kits and they work great.	&&&
These are great to keep in your purse or in your car. They are moistened just enough to clean and then the cleaner evaporates. It is wonderful to have an easy way to clean my glasses in the car. We have a touch screen in the car and after I clean my glasses, I use the sheet to clean fingerprints off the touch screen.	&&&
"These wipes get my son clean and they're the only ones I've used. His skin seems fine with them, though I've had no indication that he has sensitive skin as some may. When they're packed tightly and you have to pull harder to remove them, sometimes they do rip. If you get the box with the spare wipes container, you can just re-use your existing wipes container and use the new container for other things. E.g. I used one to hold bottle nipples, caps, etc."	&&&
Not good wipes are hard to take out.	&&&
ill never run out of these again.	&&&
I love clorox disinfecting wipes!!! My family and I even carry them on the go. We love to clean everything before we use it.	&&&
Always carry a few in my kit.	&&&
Favorite wipes by far! No smell and doesn't irritate our baby's eczema sensitive skin.	&&&
The only wipes I use!. I like that they are really moist, similar to wiping baby with a wash cloth. The different packages are great, use some for travel and some stay home to refill the wipe warmer.	&&&
Its packs well in the babybag. Doesn't take much room	&&&
I prefer these wipes over Huggies any day. They are super gentle and come apart from the other wipes a lot easier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We love these wipes! My 2 year old has super sensitive skin and these wipes worked great!\r\rI received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I've used it for my two babygirls. It helps a lot. No crying when changing diapers, they feel calmed and one less thing to get cranky about. Great for new borns. I recently bought it for a friend and she loves it.	&&&
I love the wipes for basically anything. We don't just use them for the baby the whole family uses them :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love how gentle it is on my eyes. This isn't your everyday cleanser. It gets all the makeup off without burning your eyes/skin	&&&
These are the only wipes we will use on my son. We have tried other brands and they just don't work as well and they are no where near as soft. These don't leave any residue and they have just the right amount of moisture. There is no scent at all. Using these wipes, my son never gets diaper rash or any sort of irritation. These combined with Pampers Swaddlers or Cruisers are the only diaper/wipe combo we will use.	&&&
We were given these as a baby shower gift 2 years ago for our son! He tolerates them so much better then tissues and they make it easy to wipe his nose! I give a pack as a standard baby shower gift now!	&&&
Everyone has a different opinion when it comes to diapers and wipes. I've come across two categories of wipes. Ones that seem like thick toilet paper (Huggies), and cloth like (Pampers). I prefer Huggies type. These stretch which is really annoying when getting them out of the packaging. I gave it two starts because it will clean, just not my favorite. I think it takes more wipes. Also, not a fan of the smell.	&&&
love the wipes, alot of computer screen wipes are to wet or dont get the screen clean enough, since i have been using these wipes screen is so much easier to keep clean which is great with touch laptop and touch kindle fires screens.	&&&
I bought this because I intended to use cloth wipes, well a week or so into having this baby and that idea was out the window. I tried putting regular wipes in it and it works great. With cloth wipes they stayed warm while wiping, with disposable (because they are so thin) they get cool pretty quick after I remove them. But over all I am very glad to have this unit.	&&&
"These facial wipes really work especially if you are a mature person and have a hormonal imbalance. I sometimes get acne and redness on my face - after using these wipes my face is clean and clear and you look and feel beautiful....You can confirm online but I believe Green tea is great for anti-aging, aloe firms and cucumber cools the face.
Wonderful wipes.....recommended for all persons with or without blemishes."	&&&
great wipes to use. they do not cause irritation. I use them daily	&&&
"We have a family of 6 including myself, my husband and 4 children. Being clean is definitely the number one factor for using these wipes especially with a 3-year old in the house!
I received this cool upright Cottonelle dispenser as a bzzagent and I was slightly hesitant to try anything like this but I can't believe I waited this long.
Some of the key factors for liking these are as follows:
*Clean scent - not too perfumey and doesn't smell like disinfectant either
*Good size - keeps hands clean!
*One wipe dispenser
*Plain white design of the dispenser won't clash with décor
*Safe for our septic tank - VERY IMPORTANT!

Anyway, just thought I'd put in my two-cents about it. Thanks!"	&&&
"Kid is till 16 months old. Need diapers and ofcourse wipes. Love pampers. Wipes are very absorbent too and clean up well.
I save even more by having them delivered with amazon's subscribe and save program. The time it takes me to head out the door and go to costo/target/walmart/etc....and then coming back home...versus the arriving at home thing is priceless. I use the saved time to spend with my family or just to myself to sleep.. whenever it is possible."	&&&
These are awesome. I love the fact that they have all natural ingredient's . I have been using these on my 2 month old since the day he was born and have not had any issues with irritation or rash. The scent is stronger than the one of your usual wipe but it doesn't bother me or the baby - plus it's natural oils. The wipes are not soapy or slippery and greasy as others. I would love to try the bamboo ones from the company but they are not offered through amazon. Will definitely purchase these again.	&&&
Good price for the larger wipes. These are used for adults in my house. They smell pleasant, not too perfumed. They're thick and sturdy enough that they don't rip, they do tear at the perforation easily as well. They fit nicely in the larger tubs. I accidently purchased some smaller refills prior to finding this one.	&&&
I use this product on the to! It's straps onto all my strollers and the Velcro is very strong! The wipes fit snug so they don't fall out! Highly recommend !!	&&&
This was the first time I had tried Seventh Generation Wipes and they surprised me in a great way! I love how strong they are, yet soft enough I can use them on my son's face and bum (not the same wipe of course). I will surely be buying more of these in the future. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I have purchased many different brands of wipes and these are the best. I use them on my eyeglasses, computer monitor, smartphone, etc... There's no residue and it dries very quickly. Keep these handy in my purse and in my vehicle.	&&&
These do what they are suppose to do better than others I have tried. Septic tank safe.	&&&
are small but adequate. Have a strong odor	&&&
"I used these on my baby granddaughter. It works great Doesn't irate her little nose. The smell is also pleasant.
Would high recommend it."	&&&
We use these all the time, not just for our LO but for ourselves. We have seen a change in the way they are made and we are a little disappointed, not sure why they always change things when they are working well, but we will continue to buy and use these wipes.	&&&
These wipes seem alright, but really only work on smooth surfaces. It is really difficult to jam the corner of a wipe into the crevices on my breast pump and clean the parts adequately. Save yourself the money and just wash your breast pump parts with soap and water. You're probably going to rinse the parts off anyway.	&&&
I bought this as a joke lunch box and ended up really liking it. It's cute and I got a lot of comments on it. "	&&&
I love these wipes, they are gentle on my baby's sensitive skin and we have had no rashes since switching over to them. They do have a strong smell though, it's not unpleasant but quite strong. That's my only complaint. I would recommend these wipes.	&&&
Not the softest wipes but great for the price. I use these to get the large portion of a mess off my daughter's butt and then fine tune the cleaning princess with a softer wipe. Some of them have tiny balls forming after about three months of use, but overall get the job done.	&&&
I liked the thickness and softness of this baby wipe. I also use them for me (the adult in the house).	&&&
Perfect nail wipes for gel polish, clean and lint free, only need one for both hands. Great price and super fast shipping.	&&&
"This product is easy to carry around, cute, and keeps my wipes from getting dry and easy to clean."	&&&
I Loved the durability of them as well as the scent however, they seemed to break both of my boys out causing them to have a terrible rash. I had to discontinue the use of the wipes on them and use them for myself so they didn't go to waste.	&&&
these wipes are really nice on my babies skin they work really well, smell good and can get through a change with only 2 wipes!!	&&&
I've tried quite a few wipes over the past year for my son and these are my absolute favorite! I love the fact that they are natural! They don't irritate my son's skin, nor do they leave a sticky feeling like others'. I didn't realize my son's skin was so sensitive until I noticed little breakouts and redness during the time I was using other wipes. Now I try to stick with these. I have never had a problem with him getting a rash while exclusively using t hese. I also use these to remove my makeup lol. They get the job done and doesn't make my face breakout either.	&&&
"I have been using these wipes since day one. My baby is very sensitive and these wipes work great with my child's sensitive skin."	&&&
The pampers natural clean wipes are really great wipes. Nice, clean, and strong!	&&&
I love Lysol wipes for quick clean ups. I had some difficult with a very late arrival on this product (I needed it to clean my new home), but it eventually got to me. The value is okay (you might be able to do better finding it on sale in stores) but the convenience of having it here in bulk quantities is great. This is despite the fact that I like the 'blue' scent, which is not in the package.	&&&
Love the plastic bags. Much better than hard case. These are easy to fit in any bag. The wipes stay wet and are easy to get out of plastic. I put them in the bag that goes to our babysitters house everyday. Very convenient. Never have to refill... just throw bag away when empty.	&&&
Half of them were dry	&&&
"great for sensitive skin-the vitamin E is an added bonus! love them!"	&&&
Good purchase	&&&
"Extremely convenient to toss it in the diaper bag or purse. I love the its a soft flexible case. Way better then the hard plastic wipe cases that crack. The filp open top is also great and adds the to the convenience while not allowing the wipes to dry out."	&&&
I like the product. It's effective and soothing. It's also available at a much lower price at Costco.	&&&
I have five kids from 3 to 14 and I have tried many different wipes through these messy years. But Huggies wipes have been the best. They are gentle on my child and yet can get the job done. I don't just use Huggies wipes for potty clean up. They make great home clean ups and the kids can help by using them, too. I can be extra thrifty and rip them in half and get twice as much. I have accidentally washed some wipes and when i got it out of the dryer I had a perfect duster cloth! I al ways have Huggies wipes on the go and I can't imagine not having Huggies wipes around even when all my kids are grown. My friends and I love how Huggies wipes make clean up easy! What would motherhood look like without them?	&&&
These wipes are great. They are perfect for sensitive skin. I won't use any other brand!	&&&
So far so good. No rash. Our babes has trouble with whatever is in other wipes. Thought we would try Pampers and so far, so good.	&&&
Love these wipes. The smell is good and my baby does not show any signs of irritation from using them. I love the packaging too, nothing like bright colors :) Very happy with these.	&&&
I was so happy to receive this because I wanted my little man to be changed in comfort! It does the job in keeping the wipes warm, but once it's unplugged, it only takes about a minute for them to get cool. I really like the idea of a wipe warmer, but I struggle with this one because it hardly holds any wipes. As a single FTM I do not have time to constantly be filling the thing up with new wipes. Another downfall is that the first wipe is half way dried out.	&&&
I wasn't to impressed with Pampers wipes. The wipes were thin and the packaging were not easily accessable for busy moms.	&&&
Love these wipes! The only thing I do not like is that they do not have a pop up top. You just have to have an extra box to put them in; not a big deal for the price you pay.	&&&
These wipes are incredibly soft and strong. I bought Huggies Sensitive wipes and they were so rough! I couldn't believe they were meant to be used on babies super sensitive skin. I have always loved Pampers and will stick with them.	&&&
I ordered these to hold me off until my Amazon Prime monthly order arrived with my Huggies Natural Wipes. I am very disappointed in these wipes. They are NOT fragrance free, they smell like hand sanitizer. They are not soft, they are scratchy and my poor newborn already has bad diaper rash and these are not helping. And, most importantly, they are larger than Huggies and do not fit in my diaper warmer or my plastic wipe tubs that I reuse. I have to bend the edges up to make them fit in the warmer (which we use a lot in this cold weather). I would most definitely pass on these wipes that are more expensive than Huggies anyway. We are very happy with Huggies Natural and that's what I recommend.	&&&
I've tried different brands and pampers is definitely my favorite. The wipes don't rip as I'm trying to take them out. And for my sons sensitive skin these are the only ones that don't dry his skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Best wipes ever only ones I like to buy	&&&
I like these wipes. They're soft and work really nicely....until my son has a really tough, sticky and nasty poopy. They seem to be a bit flimsy and don't hold up like I feel they should. Other than that I love them, they don't kill my son's sensitive skin like others do.	&&&
These rip easily and not nearly as soft as pampers or amazons wipes.	&&&
I was hoping to get different designs but I got 6 of the same one. The cardboard wraps were damaged which sucked because I was giving them as gifts. Also, over time the plastic flap unstuck from the bag as it is inevitably folded up in my diaper bag.	&&&
One of my twins had very sensitive skin. We had to be very particular about products. We tried other wipes, but most would leave him with rashes. These were always very gentle on his skin.	&&&
Knowing that these wipes are safe makes me feel much better about how often I use them. I received a free sample of the product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
Life savers with a huge stainless steel refrigerator and a stainless steel dishwasher. If I ever find who is 'finger-painting' the fronts of those appliances it will be 20 lashes with a wet noodle.	&&&
handy for babies hands especially when out and don t want to carry big bulky wipe packs...	&&&
Love this product	&&&
We love this wipes dispenser! It is good quality and works perfectly. It is great for on the go.	&&&
Great product. It doesn't overly dry out your skin, but is effective in keeping the oil at bay.	&&&
Works Great, but to me the scent to me is a little odd. It's not a bad scent just a little odd.	&&&
Individually wrapped single use wipes. We use these when out with our children at the park, restaurant or anywhere we need to quickly wipe their hands or clean something. Stores easily and stays moist. The larger packaging wet wipes would dry out in the car or left long in the diaper bag. Not a doctor or scientist, so can not talk to the cleaning factors but gives a concerned parent piece of mind.	&&&
WORKED WELLON CAT	&&&
"""All my family has use this on their kids/babies.

It is not the wet its perfect and easy to used.

Everything great the way they work and feel."""	&&&
I love this product it works exactly like the make up remover on a pad. amazing.	&&&
"I like how these wipes are thicker compared to other leading brands."	&&&
The wipes does a great job, for an affordable price. It does not irritate my son's skin. I have used it on all my kids, plus I get rewards for using it. Great job Huggies.	&&&
We have steel appliances. I was hoping that this would be an easy, one step polishing step. It is easy. Just pull out a cloth and wipe. Unfortunately, you need to use a dry cloth or paper towel to polish the residue from the steel appliance.	&&&
i love the fresh lemon scent plus they clean really well	&&&
Saved a few dollars	&&&
"I purchase this size pack for my daycare provider. We both like the durability of the wipe and that the wipe has almost no smell. Also my son with sensitive skin never has an issue with natural care Huggies wipes.
I was prompted to write a review by the Babys'R'Us review sweepstakes."	&&&
Easy cleaning! A must!!	&&&
"Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes Clutch N' Clean Carrying Case IS CUTE AND STYLELISH. I USE IT ON MY BABY GIRL AND ITS GREAT FOR HER SENSITIVESKIN"	&&&
love this product my little sister is in elementary so shes always getting sick we started using these and shes gotten sick less	&&&
These were our favorite wipes! They are thick and soft, and they don't tear easily. Being sensitive, I never worried about my child having a reaction to them, like he did to some of the scented wipes. Even though he is our of diapers now, I still buy these and carry them with us for wiping hands and faces, sticky cups, and other messes when we are out!	&&&
Great scent. Our dog loves it - will even lick it when we try to wipe her with it.	&&&
They are so convenient to have when I pump at work.	&&&
Greta for babies though it can be used by adults also:) I always keep a small supply in each bathroom to sometimes wipe hands , keep the sinks wiped down, and to lightly wipe up spills on the floor. I have used this all though my sons till he turned three.These wipes smell great and do not dry out easily.T hey are the right size and moisture level for many purposes...diaper cleanings, face, hand & high chair cleaning after meals, sinks wiped down ,etc. I love them!	&&&
Works but the pad dries really quickly.	&&&
I use this to wipe off my dogs paws after a long walk outside and also clean him off after he potties or gets dirty from running around. Seems to work great and doesn't irritate his skin.	&&&
Huggies wipes do the job. They are thick, soft and smell good.	&&&
Very durable high quality wipes that never tear apart. Unscented and hypoallergenic!!! I recommend these for your baby.	&&&
"My son has eczema, so everything we use has to be fragrance free. These wipes have been wonderful! They are gentle and have never caused irritation. They really are the only wipes we use!"	&&&
I love Pampers!! I will always but this brand! I recommend this brand to every mom!	&&&
"I love these wipes. My baby never gets diaper rash, these seem sensitive and one wipe goes a long way if used smartly."	&&&
"I love the reusable container, which is adorable, and I would not use any other wipes. They do not smell, are easy on the skin, and they also do not leave residue."	&&&
"""Our family uses Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes daily, since 2006, when our first daughter was born. 8 years later and 4 kids born, we use nothing else. Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes are reasonably priced for the great quality, the thickness, the moisture they hold for cleaning, are soft & gentle even now on our 9-month-olds skin and require less wipes to thoroughly do the job versus other brands.

It would be nice to be able to locate more coupons inside the packaging for the various sizes of baby wipes. Coupons would help us greatly, especially since we have been loyal customers for so long and would and do recommend theses wipes to family and friends."""	&&&
i do like them, but wish the sheets were a bit LARGER?	&&&
I plan on returning them. Not at all happy with the product or quality of the product. this needs to be researched and fixed.	&&&
"""I love the tub designs you can choose from - they are cute without being overly sweet. The tub works great for single-handed diaper changing and keeps wipes fresh and moist.



I actually really like Huggies wipes - they are thick and work well, and can easily be torn if you just need a small sheet. The only reason we don't buy them more often is because other brands come cheaper!"""	&&&
"It is so nice to have warm wipes and the night lite is just a bonus. The only downfall is that it doesn't hold the largest wipes on the market. I highly recommend this product to everyone."	&&&
I purchase these for adult clients. They are a good product	&&&
Great for quick clean-ups	&&&
After some web searches I found these were highly recommended for sensitive skin and that they work great. It's true!! I love them. I use them every day and subscribe to the twin pack for monthly delivery. They're great on mascara.	&&&
Best wipes there is on the market	&&&
"not a review as much as the service. I have 5 kids spaced about 4 years apart - I have been buying diapers/wipes for 20 years. The ""subscription"" service at amazon is awesome - no more trips to the store in the middle of the night for diapers or wipes.

Having bought a million wipes, Huggies have been the best in terms of cleanliness, rash, comfort, etc. We have tried just about everything and keep coming back to Huggies. There may be some better alternatives in non-alchohol, hypo-allergenic, wipes particularly from fair trade, non-bleached sources, but the Huggies ""natural care"" are a solid go to that are available everywhere."	&&&
This is so much better than the old plastic wipes containers. I love the print, the zipper and the clutch style! I agree that if this product came with a pocket it would be perfect. I own one, and I've given them as gifts; they've yet to be met with a poor review!	&&&
I was given a box of pampers wipes for a baby gift. ever since the first time I used them on my daughter I was very pleased. You do not need that many to clean a messy diaper compaired to others. and they are perfect for a baby who has very sensative skin. only small thing I dislike is the smell of them	&&&
great price	&&&
I really like using wipes to clean counter tops or other surfaces instead of using a cleaner and a paper towel or rag because of the convienience. I really like the smell and feel the area is clean but for really getting a stain or scrubbing, i have found other products that have scubby side of the wipes, also i havnet found that stains from blue berries or things that you need to use other cleaners for that these work on. overall they are great because they disinfecr, smell good and clean!	&&&
Everything is great	&&&
"I love this product they always have a great sent and various types to try to fit your perfect need. Also very affordable."	&&&
Love this product	&&&
"I have personally used this product before and after becoming a mother and I love it. They are naturally made, and they are great for sensitive skin. I recommend these to everyone with or without children. They are a must have!"	&&&
These work beautifully! So glad I found something to make my stainless appliances sparkle.	&&&
This is a nice product. The only issue I had with it was the fact it did not take the old dry erase ink off my board very easily. I had to scrub my board hard to get it to come off. But it works great for fresh ink that is on there."}},	&&&
Perfect size for planes & travel .... what people say about the weird aroma is true, doesn't really bother me , but it would be so much better if they could infuse a true lemon scent.	&&&
"To begin, its best to describe this tub as huge! This product is as economical as it is practical, in the home!

A few product details:

These wipes are an awesome deal! They clean my counters on the first swipe! As someone who is always in need of ways to keep my home clean for both my family and fur-babies, this product has fit the bill! Each wipe fits well in the hand, does not have excess solution, comes in an ergonomic, green packaging, and are sure to be a staple in my home.

These are a holiday necessity!"	&&&
just what i need	&&&
Bought these for a gift, and you can't go wrong with Pampers. This is a great product and is one you can count on. I did the brand test of diaper/wipe products when my boys were young and we were Pampers fans all the way.	&&&
Soft, resistent, good odor.	&&&
"I have been buying this product for several years from Staples, we use a lot of them in the office, especially now with cold season on us. I use them to clean the counter tops, door handles, file cabinet handles etc. computer keyboards and much more. About to run out, will be heading to Staples tomorrow to get more, plus more paper while I have coupon"	&&&
These have been my favorite brand since my ten year old niece was a baby, and they have been my first choice with my daughter as well. Both my niece and my daughter have sensitive skin and the simply clean are the ones that have worked the best to get them completely clean without causing rashes. They don't rip or slide all over the place like some other well known brands and they work great as a one and done type wipe. We've tried other brands depending on sales but I never use the whole pack of the other brands because they just don't work the same. Huggies are also the best if your kids draw on stuff because they are wonderful to get anything off, including permanent marker off them:)	&&&
These wipes works the best for my daughter and plan on using these again for my next baby. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Never thought I'd be a connoisseur of ways to wipe a baby's butt, but it turns out that there really is a difference. Anyway, Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes have the positive of not leaving your hands feeling sticky, greasy, or smelling bad (well, at least not because of the wipe!). But sometimes, on *ahem* TRICKIER jobs, they pill and leave bits behind and it seems that finishing the job takes an extra wipe (or two or three) over competitors. But the hand thing is a big plus.	&&&
Wipes are very thin and dry out very quickly.	&&&
They are the only wipes I will use. There the perfect thinness and I don't have to use a ton	&&&
This was a great deal. I've always heard great things about the pampers brand. Now I get to buy it and use it for my first child	&&&
"Useful, but I thought I was ordering the ""cottony soft"" towelettes in individual foil packets. These are the same size (5 in x 7 in), but stiff & papery, although less expensive.
They're OK for my purposes, but I prefer the other kind. Will order more carefully next time."	&&&
These are better than original ones I had. Much thicker & stronger! Highly recommend them!!	&&&
One and done? Maybe against urine, which might I add doesn't necessarily need wiping in the early days. That should be added to the disclaimer, really. Granted I haven't ventured into the realms of solid foods yet, but these wipes are no match against my son's dirty diapers, sorry. I struggle to wipe the poop stain on the skin away with one wipe, it usually takes five or six.	&&&
Great special on these wipes. Can't wait to use them on our little one. Arrived quickly and packaged nicely with the other items purchased.	&&&
Great deal for cleaning my tech! I love the spray can for difficult to reach areas like my keyboard, and I'm really happy to have monitor wipes, because people keep touching my iMac screen!	&&&
I love the boogie wipes in general. Not a fan of the grape scent so I use the regular scent more often but they are great to clean then nose and face too	&&&
Absolutely love Pampers wipes!!! Happy baby = Happy Momma!	&&&
Strong wipes that don't rip when you try to pull them out of the package. Bought Kirkland signature ones from Costco and they were practically wet napkins. These are way better.	&&&
Do you wear glasses? Do you have camera lenses? Do you have a glossy-screened laptop? If you answered yes to any of the above, buy 'em now and be happy. Excellent lens wipes.	&&&
They are for washing my elderly mom. They are soft and durable.	&&&
Although I use the fresh fragrance wipes of this version, I do love using the fragrance free ones when I am watching other babies and am not sure of their skin sensitivity! Better safe than sorry! These would be great for newborns as well!	&&&
These dust wipes really work great! They actually wipe up dust and don't push the dust. I would highly recommend these dust wipes!	&&&
"They wipes work for what described! We have a preemie so we are constantly cleaning everything! These wipes make it so much easier with that! They could be a little more moist though. I guess we could have picked up an older package but the wipes seemed a little dried out."	&&&
It is an easy to use product and cleans as they promise, but when gets to cleaning the mascara from lashes, I lose too many lashes and pimples here and there. It is good for nights that you are too tired to play around your face!	&&&
We love the wipes, great scent. Not to strong of a smell and gentle on my kids. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These free and clear wipes work great. My baby didn't have any kind of sensitivity or reaction to these like other wipes I've tried. Would buy and have already recommended. I got a free sample to try and my opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I love these wipes-they're strong & soft and they smell awesome.	&&&
The store brand is better! I got these because they were "natural care" but they, like other name brands irritate my baby's bottom! So surprised the wipes made all the difference in skin irritation! They are hard to separate from one another and rip easily. I have no idea how they got 5 stars ever.	&&&
I wanted to try these wipes because there was a sale on them. I ordered 4 boxes because I just had a baby and knew that I would definitely use them. I just ran out of my Pampers sensitive and when I used the first wipe it was so rough in comparison. Considering it was Huggies, I thought it would be just a little bit better quality. I stopped my Subscribe and Save and will not be purchasing anymore after this.	&&&
These wipes are great if you prefer thinner wipes. Gentle, no funky chemicals, no bad smell. I prefer thicker wipes though, and for the messier diaper changes, tend to use 3 wipes when 1 thicker wipe would have done the job.	&&&
The baby wipes are ok.But I like Huggies' better .	&&&
The wipes container was dirty, it had some black thing all throughout the exterior of the box. I also found this at a Kroger store for only $2 when they sell it for around $4 online.	&&&
Most of the feminine wipes are very, very small in size and you find yourself using more than you'd expect to get the job done. These are larger in size and gives you that confidant feeling that the job is done completely and right. Personal hygiene is important to any woman and these leave you clean, confidant, and fresh.	&&&
This awesome pack...I normally pack this in the diaper bag, trust me those wipes come in handy to clean the pacifiers....plus the colors are so darn cute....just buy it...I love mine..so happy with this..	&&&
She has tried them all on our grandsons and likes Luvs Ultra Clean the best. What I saw looked like a quality material in a nice compartment. So we might as well have them here ready for her at a value price.	&&&
I was skeptical of this product when reading its description on the Amazon product website. Its price seemed to be too good to be true. However, the wipes really do remove the fingerprints and other non-permanent marks on my stainless steel appliances. The facings of these appliances look new after I clean them with this product. The wipes are odorless. One wipe is enough to clean surfaces of my refrigerator and dishwasher.	&&&
I purchased this as a backup and just opened it when I ran out today. The top of one of the packages was bashed in and broken, and the wipes had dried out. I pried it off with a knife but they are no longer usable. Very disappointing.	&&&
I do not use these personally that much but I keep them in the bathroom mainly for visitors and friends that I know that love these. I've researched flushable wipes a little bit and found that the cottonelle wipes are highly rated on the fact they break up into tiny pieces once flushed into the drain system. Most other wipes do not break up at all or not enough to be considered flushable. They cause many drain clogging issues either locally at the source or further down the drainage system. The smell is pleasant and they container is very nice looking. I use the subscribe and save or just buy some refills to cut down on the cost.	&&&
These don't do much and actually seem not worth the bother. Stick with cloth and spray or other cleaner. Won't buy again.	&&&
Love these wipes. They get the job done and don't dry out as quick as others!	&&&
Great value for the price	&&&
"I was hesitant to get this considering bad reviews of vacuum component. I ordered it due to other good reviews and being hopeful.

Pros: easier than scrubbing than with your hands and cleaning part works ok...
Cons: vacuum part is completely useless...no power and doesn't pick up pretty much anything on vacuum setting and sometimes not well on drying settings either as suction goes on and off...I was almost in tears I was so disappointed. I would have returned it but I didn't want to deal with that hassle and the mopping part works alright..decided to keep it for now.. sigh..."	&&&
Cannot beat this product for travel and putting in a purse or car. Just wish they sold them in the stores again.	&&&
After trying several face wipes, these are my favorite. They work great with my sensitive skin and leave my face feeling clean and soft. They don't have a strong smell and are well worth the cost. I also like that they do not have a ton of chemicals. I try to use healthier products.	&&&
I love these products because I know that, while I am spending more than cheaper or generic brands, I don't have to buy products like diaper cream to put on my baby. For example - these wipes! They keep my baby's butt clean and fresh (and are very durable) without the worry of what I'm rubbing on her skin. I love them!	&&&
These are the best wipes yOu can get. Not only good for baby, but mom also.	&&&
Generally I don't have terribly sensitive skin however I bought these cleansing wipes on sale. I won't be purchasing these again, as with other reviews I've read these burn my skin plus even turned it red.	&&&
Comparable to expensive name brand wipes. Get the jpb done and is not irritating on my babies skin.	&&&
I used these a few times then decided it wasn't really worth the trouble. My daughter didn't like any of the flavors. I even tried chilling them in the fridge to help with teething but it didn't make a difference. Plus she didn't like me shoving a finger in her mouth - go figure! Instead, we started using a Baby Buddy 360 toothbrush.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes by far. Smell fresh, packaging is strong and durable, and they are great for diaper bags in these plastic type bags.	&&&
We use them, and it is nice not having to shop for them - they are delivered right to the front door. Convenience and good price - what more do you need?	&&&
"This is highly rated as a silver polish and deserves the rating. I was raised with silverplate and the occasional sterling silver spoon so have a large silver collection for every day use. I dread getting the tarnish off. It's messy and more than that time consuming. Since we use the silver plate every day we don't wrap in felt protectors. I used to use dips, then pastes, foams, finally wipes - expensive wipes but not that easy to use.
Then I got exasperated enough to do my research and found these. They make fast work of silver cleaning and do an excellent job of taking off tarnish and keeping it off. I don't dread the time anymore."	&&&
Great price especially with the Amazon coupon. Other baby wipes dry my hands out but these don't, and they are thick enough that they don't tear when wiping the baby's bottom.	&&&
I absolutely LOVE these wipes! I was worried they wouldn't perform as described on the package (countertops,glass,electronics,wood) but they DO it all. Cleaned my filthy coffee table no problem, the glass and frames of my pictures, tv screens, monitor screens -- WOW. I just wish they were BIGGER then I could do more before having to get a fresh one out of the pack.	&&&
These wipes are soft but strong. They never irritate my baby and I am never concerned that they will tear. Huggies is a brand I trust and I definitely recommend these wipes.	&&&
These wipes are thick enough that you actually use only one wipe to clean. It is durable and am happy to say that it doesn't tear like other products.	&&&
This is an awesome thing to have when your baby drops their paci on the floor and you're not able to wash it off. Just pull out the wipe and clean off the paci and baby is good to go!	&&&
I have been using Lysol disinfecting wipes for a few years now and I pretty much use these all the time for everything. They smell great and are so convenient to clean up messes and for general weekly cleaning. I stocked up on them so I could keep one handy in almost every room. With a baby and toddler creating messes, it's nice to know I can still keep things clean, sanitized and germ-free. They last for quite awhile also. It seems like they made the packages even bigger than they were a couple years ago.	&&&
Dog smells better, Dog Stays cleaner, our clothes and furnitue stay cleaner. Wife is happy. Whats not to like, it's a good deal on a lot of wipes...	&&&
I would never recommend this product. Wipes get warm, but become cold as soon as you take them out... IF you can get them out! I tried 3 different brands of wipes and they consistently tear while trying to pull them out the dispenser. Also dries out the remaining wipes really quickly. Worst purchase of my entire registry.	&&&
"I have tried a lower cost generic brand, but they are not as nice as the Wet Ones brand. I buy them by the dozen and use them all over the house. Good to throw in the car for trips."	&&&
It smells good, its soft for changing it doesn't make my sons bottom raw. and the individual packaging is easy to have in the diaper bag and on the go.	&&&
"These disinfecting wipes are perfect for everyday use.
I find myself reaching for one of these quite often & I'm very happy about that.
Definitely keeps my surfaces clean, germ free, and fresh scented. Just the way I like it.
I actually use these for the bathroom as well, and I find that its excellent for that as well.
Definitely recommend these. A MUST have in every home!"	&&&
nice good quality cloths. we use it to dry our baby after wipes and it's been great. no rashes.	&&&
The packaging and the dispensing is very good and convenient. The frustation came from the wipes which are good only for tiny sized lenses like spectacles or camera lenses. The wipes are not adequately wet/moistened with the cleaning solution. Wipes dry up very fast, so you need to be quick. Otherwise you will need to open second wipe pack. Absolutely not suitable for laptop, iPad, tablet, LCD screen, TV like large screen, you will need couple of wipes to complete the task.	&&&
I love these wipes and they clean well and smell good!	&&&
I love the wipes, i wipes down everything. I love the wipes, i wipes down everything. I love the wipes, i wipes down everything	&&&
Too much moister. Bad texture. It's hard to grip the wipes as you use them. Going back to the Kirkland brand.	&&&
"hard to get out the wipe."	&&&
The thickest, softest wipes I have tried. Gentle and efficient. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
"I thought this brand would be better quality than the warmer I used with my first child but it was just the same. it's only been 4 months and the rubber was too stiff, not easy to pull wipes and it already ripped."	&&&
THESE WIPES ARE NOT ONLY GREAT FOR USING ON YOUR LITTLE ONES BOTTOMS BUT FOR ALL OTHER MESSES THEY CAN GET INTO! THEY ARE VERY STURDY AND DONT RIP OR FALL APART! THEY ARE GREAT I WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMEND!	&&&
Lysol wipes are Lysol wipes! What else can I say! I like having a canister in every room!	&&&
Love the clean smell	&&&
I ride my road bike to work from 10-30 miles away and these action wipes are awesome for cleanup. Even gets chain grease off my legs!	&&&
These wipes do the job and are relatively strong enough to handle some of the larger "messes" my infant son has produced. The main thing that bothers me about these wipes are the smell. Though they are unscented, they have some odor and it's not a pleasant smell for me. The smell stuck around after use a little longer than I like and usually I would have to wash my hands to keep them from smelling too. Pros are that they are free and clear which keeps me purchasing them when they are on sale but the cons of the smell keep me from making them my go-to wipe brand.	&&&
Ordered online through honest company website and I have to say, I'm very disappointed. The wipes smell as if there was a electrical circuit fire and all 4 of my packages smell the same. Needless to say, I'm going to send the wipes out for a lab test to ensure there were no harmful chemicals in this batch I received. The smell is horrible and I thought it was just the brand but I'm now suspicious ever since we used them that day. My baby got sick and since then I stopped using them. The honest company wanted the product back, but that won't happen until I get the lab results in. To the Honest company, I would closely monitor my outsourced company material considering the product is made in China.	&&&
The price is good and it serves it's purpose.	&&&
We only use Pampers Sensitive wipes for our infant son. These wipes are affordable and do not irritate his little bottom!	&&&
Excellent product. Plenty of alcohol on the pads.	&&&
"Works Great, but to me the scent to me is a little odd. It's not a bad scent just a little odd."	&&&
"I've been using these for over 2 months now and have never had a problem with baby rash. I like them and will continue to buy them."	&&&
Worked fine...a little too "stretchy" for me. Also had an issue with my son developing a bit of a rash using them....he has super sensitive skin. Would love if the formula felt a little less "slick"	&&&
I love Clorox wipes for many reasons! Wipes are so quick and easy to use. I even leave a canister under my son's sink for him to use as needed. They do an excellent job of cleaning and I enjoy the lemon scent. It freshens up the area nicely!	&&&
Somewhat disappointing as a cleaner. Leaves smudges.	&&&
I received these wipes at my baby shower & they are fabulous. So safe, gentle and soothing on baby's skin. The case fits great in her diaper drawer and won't dry out if I accidently leave them open. As a newborn they worked great to clear up her baby acne. At three months old she has not had a diaper rash.	&&&
These wipes are great, they clean pretty much everything. I keep them around my desk area and in my car. I like the scent and the good quality of the wipes they are more heavy duty than other brands.	&&&
I received these sanitizing wipes for hands and surfaces to try. These wipes are pretty nice. They really come in handy during the cold/flu season. They are a pretty nice size. They are also nice and moist but not too wet. They have a light citrus scent and they don't have the overbearing smell of alcohol. In fact, they don't have any alcohol, which can be very drying to the skin. It's also great that these wipes can be used on your hands, body, and hard surfaces. I don't have to have separate wipes for sanitizing my hands/body and separate wipes for sanitizing just hard surfaces. These wipes are nice and soft, yet they are very durable. Its nice that they come in 150 ct. canister. They should last you a pretty good while.	&&&
i love Clorox wipes. They are the perfect item to help me keep all the areas of my home clean with a quick wipe down. This is especally important with preschoolers who like to explore everything using their hands and mouths. Clorox wipes help me disinfect all surfaces in a matter of minutes. They also travel well and I keep a container in my car.	&&&
I like these wipes. They get the job done, but I do see myself using a lot more wipes to get everything cleaned off versus other wipes.	&&&
These are some of my favorite wipes. They do not disappoint.	&&&
Great product to keep surface top and bed rail clean for in home patient."}},	&&&
Just got a new car and want to start off by really taking care of it inside and out and these are awesome and SO convenient!! I keep some in my trunk so that I can take care of everything when I was my car! Highly recommend!!	&&&
They will clog your main sewer line. Don't flush them!	&&&
these wipes are durable and thick for big messes/ not super wet which is a good thing for poop explosions	&&&
"The Softy wipe has a nice tangy, kitchen clean scent and is very soft. Each wipe measures 7"" x 8"" and that's a pretty decent size for wipes.

I like the Softy All-Purpose Sanitizing Wipes because it's thick and doesn't dry our hands. My daughters can use it on their hands without drying their skins and it's also great to use to sanitize our tables and counters. It doesn't tear up even if I use it to wipe our table and counter and leaves the surface smelling nice and clean.

I also didn't have the problem of soapy/sticky hands after using the Softy wipes which I think is nice. I'm glad that it's alcohol-free and infused with Aloe and Vitamin E."	&&&
Very good product for serious dusting!	&&&
These worked adequately to clean most surfaces. They were slightly streaky. I liked using them in the car particularly. However, for more heavy duty tasks they did not work quite as well. These are more convenience based and for maintenance cleaning. They also worked well in a hasty pinch for cleaning the stove top.	&&&
These smell strongly of lavender but that's OK. I keep several in my purse for washroom trips when I'm out and about. I don't like using the sink because that's where most of the germs are. With these, I can clean-up once I've left the area.	&&&
"""I used these on my baby granddaughter. It works great Doesn't irate her little nose. The smell is also pleasant.

Would high recommend it."""	&&&
great value	&&&
Great price	&&&
Fairly dry, lots of streaks. Would not recommend or reorder these wipes. Got a crazy good deal or I would be returning!	&&&
Works great for cleaning my bulldogs wrinkle.	&&&
I always keep these in the car and purse. They are individually wrapped and do not dry out. They smell great, not that strong alcohol smell you get with some wipes.	&&&
These are good for ANYTHING...they can clean yr hands, body, and get this, they are the best for removing stains from clothing and upholstery, wiping a surface, and they are safe. The red packs are the best. Prefer the flat travel on over the tub so they are thicker. These have a unique smell, but it is not bad, and it won't make you smell like a baby .As my husband says, they are MacGuyver of wipes.	&&&
"Like many people, we have too many electronic devices. We also have two kids with special needs who regularly use these devices. So we really need something that is going to clean them well without leaving a sticky, not to mention unhealthy, residue behind. These are pretty much the best wipes we have found so far, though admittedly we have not tried every product on the market. These wipes do a good job cleaning the screens without leaving streaks. They are a good size - smaller than a paper towel, but a bit larger than the average baby wipe, and they have a light citrus scent. They're also thick enough, and with enough cleaner in them, to clean more than one device at a time. I usually clean all of the devices within reach with one wipe. The only drawback to using it on more than one device is that the wipe starts to break down, leaving little bits of itself behind (kind of like when you use a tissue or paper towel). To me, this isn't really a big deal because it comes off easily once it's dry (and it dries fairly quickly) but others might find that unacceptable. This is the reason I took off one star from the rating.

We had been purchasing these wipes locally, but lately we've have had trouble finding them in stores. Then a few weeks ago I was pleasantly surprised to see that Amazon now carries them; however, after checking today, I found that they're not available at the moment. I hope they get them back in stock soon. I recommend these wipes and will be purchasing more if and when Amazon gets them back in stock."	&&&
This product is nice because it comes with an umbilicalcord cut-out and it makes it more comfortable for newborns.	&&&
there great for my 7 yr old who doesn't like toilet paper. he love's there say they leaves him feeling fresh and clean.	&&&
"great product, strong dependable"	&&&
I love it, especially the design. I was trying to match my sons room which is Winnie pooh theme and was super excited to have found these because I reuse the tub for wipes on his changing station.	&&&
I've used these wipes for years and recently purchased a new pack. First thing I noticed was the smaller sized wipe. What happened to "oversized" wipes? Disappointed.	&&&
I prefer these to cleansing with Purity Made Simple. My skin has changed for the better. So easy & effective even with "bombproof" makeup. Highly recommend :-)	&&&
I always buy these off of here. It is much cheaper and very easier for me. Not only that I tend to buy more when the deal comes. Perfect for cleaning up messes and it is a must have in my house. Delivery was on time and no hassle getting it out of the box!	&&&
I really like how smell and the quality is perfect.	&&&
Clorox Wipes are a great product. It really gets the stains up and also disinfects surfaces. I use Clorox Wipes almost daily and my kitchen and bathroom stays clean and they are also easy to use.	&&&
I used this to restore the appearance of my daughter's silver flute The individual wipes really lasted long I did the whole flute with two wipes The flute was almost black over the entire body and valves The first wipe was still working well when I disposed of it, because it was now totally black from all oxidation it had removed.. the last wipe was used for the hard to reach places I was dreading this job, but the WEIMAN'S SILVER WIPES made the polishing job easy!	&&&
I love how I can just rub the product on my face, and then I'm done.	&&&
Nice product even though a bit pricey. Large sheets work well and smell good. Great portability! Would recommend!	&&&
I am really happy with this bib! I bought it anyway and I just dont put it in the washer. Its so easy to clean with a sponge and napkin, after each feeding it takes a half a minute and it's clean!! I was always cleaning the high chair out or even the carseat with food but this catches everything she drops. And I dont have the change all her clothes after eating or drinking either. Saves on laundry.	&&&
These are incredible. The best wipes I've ever purchased. I'm a pasty redhead with sensitive skin and my kids are all MY kids.. so wipes just ruin their skin. I've always made my own, but it is messy and inconvenient. This is the only wipe, I've used on newborn skin that does not cause a rash or irritate sensitive skin. I could not recommend more. :)	&&&
It does the job fine. There really isn't anything to say.	&&&
"My product can't be any better!! Luv it!!!"	&&&
"THIS CLUTCH IS PERFECT FOR THE DIAPER BAG!"	&&&
Works great. Takes of my makeup without any issues. I wish it had a better scent.	&&&
Well made no one would ever know.	&&&
Great wipes. Never irritate my kids skin. They are thick too.	&&&
These wipes are a perfect size to throw in the diaper bag an go. They are so soft. I not only use them on my grandbaby I use them for my mother who is bed ridden. She loves them.	&&&
they work awesome and do the job if only i could get past their funky smell i would be a pampers only mom but till you get some sort of smell good wipes i'm going tostick with huggies one and done cucumber and green tea	&&&
Clorox wipes keep my home and work both clean and germ free! I love the lemon scent and how fresh the whole room smells as soon as you walk in the door. They are so easy to use because you can just pull out one tissue and wipe away stuck on food. At work we use them to keep down the amount of people being sent home due to sickness. I haven't used a sick day in over 2 years! These wipes by clorox seem to work much better than the generic ones i find at dollar stores, so that makes them worth the extra money.	&&&
Pampers are my favorite wipes for any diaper situation. However I dislike that the rewards numbers are sometimes unlegable on the soft packs.	&&&
nice to have on hand, hard to find in a store.	&&&
Very good price and works great very simple to use also. Good stuff.	&&&
Works well, to freshien my hubby's face.	&&&
I have tried just about every wipe out there and we always come back to these. They hold up well and clean without those fake fragrances.	&&&
Pampers sensitive wipes work very well for my baby! She had terrible diaper rash and these wipes did not bother it. They are great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
As a breastfeeding mom that just went back to work full time, I need to pump twice a day while I'm at work. I don't have access to a sink to wash the parts of my breast pump, so when a friend suggested these to me, I thought I'd give them a try. They are super convenient for cleaning my pump parts at work. My only criticism is that the wipes are way bigger than they need to. I'd prefer if you got more wipes that were a smaller size. I tried to ripe one on half the other day to conserve the wipes, but they are very well made, and thus rip-proof.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. The have a generous amout of moisture compared to other brands, and they are super soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These worked great at getting all of my makeup off and didn't leave my face feeling dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
DONATION TO AN ORGANIZATION AND AM SO GRATEFUL THAT I CAN HELP OUT WITH THE NEEDS OF BABIES DOING WITHOUT.	&&&
These wipes worked great for both my children loved it. Note to all parents must buy and has great fresh sent for when things get really stinky.	&&&
These work well. They are not quite as wet as some of the others, if that is what you like. The are a bit of a better deal.	&&&
"I used the product on vacation because it was very easy to carry with you and it removed all the make up very nicely even around my eyes no burning or residue very gentle on the skin"	&&&
"This product is great, comes with a snap seal.which is great because when u get one to use. You can rest assure that the unused wipes are kept moist. I use these to clean pacifier or bottle nipples. I find these particular wipes very useful and are small enough to fit in any diaper bag size or style, plus they smell yummy... ( they smell like berries) :)"	&&&
these are light weight, seem to be fairly durable and keep the cloths moist enough to be effective over time.	&&&
I bought these for gifts and to carry in the diaper bag and was not disappointed with the product. They hold up well and do their job. The packaging is even a bit cute! Comparable pricing at Walmart was quite a bit cheaper, however. Unless you use free shipping and the subscription option at a 20% discount you are going to be paying about $5 more for the eight pack.	&&&
These are really nice wipes. They are the size of a small handkerchief, so are a practical size for a baby's bottom. We just use these for wiping pee with warm water, so they get a lot of use. We use another to dry afterwards. They are soft and wash well so all in all we are happy with them.	&&&
This is another Lysol Product I love! These wipes make messes of all sizes an easy clean! With the dual sides, you are able to clean easier jobs up with one side, and harder jobs with the scrubber side. I was skeptical at first, as I expected the wipe to tear when putting the scrubber side to good use. Nope! It was put to the test with some sticky sauce on the countertops that was dried on. I was able to wipe the sauce up using one wipe and very easily as well. It was almost like the Lysol activated and melted the mess away. I tend to keep these wipes everywhere- kitchen, bathroom, office, even the car! They are made for multipurpose scrubbing and cleaning! They also work wonders on stove tops and inside microwaves. Food usually can get caked on and need to be scrubbed quite a bit. Using these wipes makes clean ups quick and easy. I have never enjoyed cleaning the stove or microwave until now!	&&&
We purchased these to try in comparison with the Pampers sensitive wipes. They get the job done, but they feel almost soapy. I would use them again but recommend other brands first.	&&&
"This product is just what I'm looking for. It is light and very slim, keep the tissue moist and does not leak.
I put one on my backpack and one on my handbag.
Now I just buy the big wet tissue which cost cheaper and refill it to this buti pod. Excellent!"	&&&
I am very pleased with the way the GOOF OFF heavy duty wipes work. These wipes are very effective with removing residue from old price stickers, etc. quickly and easily. I used one to remove the SKU sticker residue on a brass air hose coupling and scuff marks on top of table saw. I find these wipes a lot easier and quicker then finding/using shop towels and a spray bottle of heavy duty cleaner or WD-40.	&&&
These wipes are extremely convenient and work well. I also use them on my phone screen, camera screen and glasses.	&&&
I always like having these to clean up after something super gross happens (cutting raw chicken or the dog puking on the floor). Every once in a while I try to stop using these in favor or something more "green" but I always end up using them again. I prefer these over the clorox wipes because i like the scent, texture, and water content better.	&&&
These are your typical Clorox wipes, but fair warning, there are no seals inside the bottles so they might be a little dry.	&&&
"These really work great even with stubborn markers.
Highly recommend."	&&&
These baby washcloths are soft and colorful. Shipping was prompt	&&&
this is actually my second set of these wash cloths. i received the first set at my baby shower, and i love them so much that i wanted more. they are incredibly soft and gentle yet effective on my baby's skin during baths. i also use them as burp cloths, or really to wipe any milk away from my baby's face during feedings. i plan on buying them for anyone else i know who has a baby!	&&&
Just used the floorMate for the second time. I'm just as impressed as the first time. Bought it to clean linoleum and hard wood floors. Could not be more satisfied. Leaves a clean and dry floor. The proof is in the dirty water tank. Oh! make sure and pinch the two halves of the dirty water tank together or you will drop the bottom half like I did the first time. If the rubber squeegee that sucks up the water will hold up, then I have a great cleaner for a fair price!	&&&
Held together well, fresh scent, didn't finger didn't break through	&&&
WOW! My car is over 10 years old and I live in FL which does not require car inspection. This product is magical!. ON the first wipe, you could see the difference. Now, this product is not going to restore a 11 year old headlight to the factory look, but it clear up my headlight tremendously. AND ONLY 4 BUCKS!	&&&
Not a whole lot to say here without being to graphic. I use these when traveling....very convenient.	&&&
I am a subscribe and save user, and I have these on a 2 month rotation. I love these for general cleaning around the house, and I have a tub in every room for spills, dusting etc. Since I have a toddler, it's great to be able to find the 3 pack at a discounted price and eligible for subscribe and save!	&&&
Never has been a better eyeglass, iPhone screen cleaner ever made - never will be - i live and die by these things - JUST enough alcohol to do the job and not drench your glasses.	&&&
I never thought I would write a review about wipes but we really love these in the citrus smell. Most wipes smells really awful and leave a lingering smell that is distasteful but these smell really good and they are antibacterial of course. We use them for in the car, in the house, hiking, boating, everywhere! This travel size is absolutely perfect to go everywhere with you that you might need them. I buy these by the case for a family of 7.	&&&
I do love these wipes especially since they actually fit in my wipes warmer! The thick seventh generation wIowa don't come out of my wipes warmer very easy. Only thing I'm not to happy with is the scent. It's supose to be fragrance free but they have a mild scent to them. Not really a bad scent but still a scent. But I love them and will continue to buy!	&&&
This is the best product I have ever used to treat vinyl or leather. This product actually repels dust from the treated surface	&&&
"I have been buying these for 2 years and I would never use another wipe! They clean,smell and feel better than any others. Love them!"	&&&
Love these for everything from hand and face wiping after a meal to wiping spit up.	&&&
I have tried numerous brands and Pampers Sensitive wipes are simply the best!! I highly recommend trying out these wipes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I used these when my daughter was a newborn. They got the job done and I liked the thickness. Didn't really like the smell though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love these wipes! I've been using them since my DD was a newborn and now she is 10 months old. They are gentle and effective in cleaning. I love that they don't have a scent too as I found one with scent often irritates. Worth every penny! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I will never buy this product again. VERY DRY.	&&&
This wipe worked great to remove makeup, and any grease or oil. wipe was a little dry, so I would wet them before use. overall great product.	&&&
Can't live without them	&&&
Look, they are just cleaning wipes. Not a necessity, but they sure are nice to have around the house (or office) to clean the screen. My iPad used to be covered with fingerprints. Now I use one cleaner to take care of the laptop, iPhone and iPad.	&&&
Wiped my baby's face with it and she turned bright red. I've used diaper wipes and pacifier wipes before on her face (by companies not claiming to be organic) with no problem, but thought I was getting a better product to wipe her face with. Not so, then read other reviews about questionable ingredients.	&&&
These are very wet! If you don't use something to dry the surface after usage, it is too moist! Very disappointed because it caused a rash on our son, and purchased so many we had to waste them!	&&&
"I went shopping in Laredo, and my sister in law told me if i coul buy a Wipes Warmer to her, when i was in the store I saw the product and I suggested to my sister to buy it too, I ended up buying two, she did not know what it was the product but she acepted, both are using the product and they are fascinated because it is cold season and my nieces are supper happy babys!"	&&&
I use these wipes religiously. I have a one year old that is constantly getting into things and running around touching everything. These wipes keep my house clean and keep my daughter safe from germs!	&&&
Does not come with a tub but great refills.	&&&
Working in an office with lots of people, it come a time when someone will come in sick. These Lysol Disinfecting Wipes have been a great helping in warding off sickness in the office. The wipes are handy and convienant. The sturdiness of the cloth wips counts and picks up the germs, dust, and grimes easily. You can feel and see the cleaniness after you use it. It leave no greasy film. The wipes come in three different scents, which is not over powering, and is pleasantly long lasting. I will be purcahsing this product again."}},	&&&
i love these because we use so much chemicals we don't need to breathe. I am happy when i use this	&&&
We tried a couple of the natural wipes on the market including babyganics and seventh generation and were left disappointed. The babyganics were not moist enough and smeared everything more than wipe it away. They were too thin. We never purchased these again after the first time. The seventh generation we used for over a month but they were too thick and were too harsh causing some diaper rash. They did a good job cleaning the bum but because of the harsh natural ingredients we looked elsewhere. I stumbled across clearly herbal online. The reviews were amazing. Very few retailers in the US carry these. Luckily I checked Amazon and they have an amazing price. The rest is history. I have been using these for the last 2 months and the diaper rash is all gone. These are the perfect thickness and do a GREAT job at cleaning the bum up. Very gentle and the scent is excellent. I have nothing bad to say. I am totally in love with these wipes. Bottom line, these are the best out there!!	&&&
These wipes are great for my son's sensitive skin, including his face! I have them on a subscription order now.	&&&
My baby is almost 4 years old as we still order these because she love them for her 'number 2.' NO scratch mess = happy kid. We love the quality and knowing its not full of chemicals.	&&&
we have used this from the beginning and liked it. they are not too sticky and they don't smell. The only problem might be that the ones on the bottom are SO much more wet than the ones on top which is quite annoying; other than that, would recommend.	&&&
"Overall good deal especially with good sized storage bin. It works with the value however I ordered 2 and both of them arrived opened and retaped. Could not use as a gift. Emailed babies r us and they credited 25% due to issue. I decided to keep and value is still useful. I'm glad they made an effort to resolve it, it was my first babies r us online purchase so I was worried at first but now feel better about it."	&&&
I received this complimentary product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review.\r\rI was so excited to try out these new facial wipes meant for sensitive skin like mine. I tend to get dry and itchy if my skin isn't used to a particular wipe but no dryness occurred. After using some all day lip stain, I used a wipe to remove the color and it worked great. Good moisture balance (not too dry or too wet) with no lingering fragrance. Definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes have become my new favorite. They don't smell too strong and get the job done. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes are great and they keep my little on from having a reaction.	&&&
These wipes work wonderfully well on all silver surfaces. They're great for big or small jobs.	&&&
"I wish I would have found out about these sooner.
We did early brushing with my son, but the older and stronger he got, the more difficult it was to brush.
I also wish I would have corrected his lip tie and tongue tie. Brushing tears the upper lip where it's attached to the base of his teeth, and they bleed.
And like so many lip/tongue tied babies, his upper 4 teeth need major work- and now they'll have to give him general anesthesia to fix them.
I found these a little to late to have possibly avoided that, but it's the only way I can consistently clean his teeth now, (or at least without having to enlist for help holding him down).
It's still a huge battle. I feel like I'm wrestling a bear, and he does bite my finger- but, I can feel where I'm cleaning, and can see a difference afterwards. And I really think the xylitol is preserving what's left.
After researching all the promising studies, I am also purchasing a bag of xylitol, as most study's state potential benefits start at a higher dose than what's likely in these wipes alone.
Overall I'm happy with these, but wish the wipe was bigger, and maybe more of a pocket design, where your fingers can slip in, rather than a flat small piece.
If not handled right, or if your impulsive, autonomous demanding toddler wants to do it himself, and/or bites you, it's easy to lose your grip on the wipe, and could be a choking hazard.
So don't leave them alone with it and pay close attention.
This is my second multipack box that I have bought for my household.
I have also given with an accompanied gift for baby showers..
I will be buying again."	&&&
It does the job.	&&&
The purchase was a gift the receipient was pleased- hard to find in their small community	&&&
Best wipes! I take them everywhere!	&&&
The site description indicated flushable wipes, which I have purchased in store were excellent. I purchased on line-FREE shipping- but what I received were the non flushable. Returned to store with an issue. Be sure the description is correct.	&&&
Love the Clorox Disinfectant wipes. My daughter is special needs and EYERYTHING is in her mouth. I love the ease of the wipes and the scent is a pleasant reminder that clean does not have to smell like a hospital.	&&&
These wipes does it job. I like the fact that these wipes are always moist & that the wipes are not too rough or thin like other brands. However, I dislike the fact that sometimes when I am pulling a new wipe...the wipe tears because it is a little "too" moist.	&&&
"These wipes are large, soft and effective at removing dirt and germs from hands and other surfaces. Convenient to carry in pockets, purses, cars, backpacks etc. Worth every penny, but would be MUCH more convenient if Sam's would once again carry them in stores. I bought these online but had to pay shipping since there's no ship-to-store option (would get full marks for value if no shipping charges applied). I did find multi-packs in the store, but the single-use packs are way more versatile and won't dry out quickly as wipes packaged in big plastic containers or re-sealable multi-packs are prone to do.
SAM'S: PLEASE CARRY THESE GERM-X SINGLES IN STORES!!!"	&&&
Cheaper than the sprays but work just as well. They clean the screens and don't leave any marks.	&&&
No harsh chemicals. It's nice to know what touches my baby's skin.	&&&
I have been a customer of Huggies products for more than 10 years. I have four boys and I'm currently expected twins. As soon as I began my registry, I knew that I needed a product that would be more efficient, not only for the quality of the product but the value of what you are getting with this product. When I came upon the newborn gift set, I knew that it had to be a "must-have" item on my registry list. I would recommend this product for anyone with small children (in diapers) for all stages of life (Newborn - Potty Training).	&&&
Absolutely love the scent of these and my yoga students do as well. And they clean the mat very nicely!	&&&
"I haven't really put it to use yet, as I am still pregnant but when I do i will definitely come back and write anther review. I didn't like that it looks as if it were used and returned. the box was broken and the product was a little dirty."	&&&
Know what's even better than wiping your ass with some good, cottony paper? A good WET wipe!	&&&
Speedy delivery and great refillable products to help you and your kids fight off the ever growing bugs out there today and the scum that never wash their hands after using the rest rooms, yuckkkkkk!	&&&
Best I've used	&&&
"This product is used on a daily, and has been used since i gave birth to my daughter in Oct 2013. I tried other brands like pampers, kirkland, and other store brand wipes, but nothing compares to these. They are soft and do the job. Not only for diaper changes, but for dirty hands after a day at the park, cleaning up sticky hands from a popsicle. I will definitely be using these wipes when my second is born, in May 2015. I highly recommend using these wipes, they really do make a difference."	&&&
I wear a good amount of black liquid eyeliner because of my monolids. I also line my waterline and tightline so it takes a good number of swipes to get all the eye makeup off. I had heard good things about these wipes because it's supposed to be all natural & chemical free so I decided to try it out. The first swipe across the first eyelid burned/stung my skin. I tried the other side and it did the same thing. It didn't take off much eye makeup in the few swipes I took. My eyes are already on the sensitive side so I didn't want to keep trying to use it. Could just be that my skin doesn't mesh well with this product.	&&&
"LOVE the portability of these wipes! I also love that I can use these on my 3 month old and not worry about it getting in his eyes or mouth!

I received this product in exchange for an honest review. Here's the hard part: While I love the wipes, the price tag is out of this world! I'm not sure I would buy this product at the price listed on Amazon."	&&&
"I love Clorox disinfecting wipes because they are so convenient for me being a mom of two.
I use these primarily in the kitchen, on my baby's high chair, and in the bathroom of our household.
It's a brand that I trust and I know when I use it I am really cleaning and disinfecting the item of my choice."	&&&
I love these, they have been in my nursery since 7 months a go!	&&&
Love pampers, only wipes I use. This whole box last us over a month.	&&&
These are the only baby wipes I can use on my daughters sensitive skin without her getting a rash. They are a bit thin but work well. the only issue I have had is a couple of the boxes I have ordered have had a few things of wipes that seemed quite dry compared to the usual ones. The price is great compared to other places I have shopped. If your child has sensitive skin I would recommend these.	&&&
I love this Floor cleaner. Makes cleaning my tile floors so much easier. I know it keeps my grout cleaner, if not from the scrubbing it picks up the dirty water and doesn't leave it behind in the grout lines. Makes quick work of floor cleaning.	&&&
This home is presently a hospital setting. The Lysol disinfecting wipes make clean-ups easier and the added benefit is that they smell so pleasant! They fit our needs perfectly.	&&&
We used Pampers sensitive wipes for our daughter when she first came home from the hospital. They are very gentle on baby's skin and clean well. The only drawback is that they can be expensive compared to other brands.	&&&
Seems to work good but they r dang expensive so i doubt i will reg. purchase this item.	&&&
"I love these wipes. The scents are pleasant and I appreciate knowing
that they're killing germs. I use mainly in the kitchen & bathroom and I won't travel without them."	&&&
they work awesome and do the job if only i could get past their funky smell i would be a pampers only mom but till you get some sort of smell good wipes i'm going tostick with huggies one and done cucumber and green tea	&&&
These things rule. If you're traveling in the summer... And you have to deal with travel crazy issues, it's hot, kids, too much booze, man whatever these things make like better.	&&&
The Floormate Spin Scrub is NOT a quality Hoover Product. The motor was designed with steel to steel bearings and a rubber dry cap on the commentator end. If you use the appliance for any prolonged period of time the motor shaft warms up, dries out the lubricant at the fan end and starts a process of galling the shaft and bearing. I didn't get more than 20 hours of use out of this appliance before the motor bearings were worn to the point of causing intense shaking and a really loud noise that made the appliance useless. I will submit pictures of the motor and bearings in a follow-up posting	&&&
I just tried these out tonight . They work great! So much less cleanup after dinner. I love that they can just be wiped off	&&&
I haven't really put it to use yet, as I am still pregnant but when I do i will definitely come back and write anther review. I didn't like that it looks as if it were used and returned. the box was broken and the product was a little dirty.	&&&
"it feels like fabric, smooth and good quality."	&&&
I purchased these with the intent to use them on my chest and back as I am almost always broken out. So far I really like them I have noticed a difference. So far they are helping my current blemishes and helping to prevent new ones. I tend to use them in the evening if I don't get a chance to take a second shower for the day. I have not use them on my face so I'm not sure how well they work in regards to removing make up. I give 4 stars only because they leave a SLIGHT filmy feeling where they were used."}	&&&
as a teacher I am always cleaning something. Clorox wipes are a must. They are the fastest and easiest thing to use. I always need a quick fix that I know will clean. I request these wipes every year	&&&
I use the product daily during diaper changes, after feedings and other time they are needed. My children have sensitive skin so the shea buter helps their skin especially on their little faces!	&&&
I ordered these in an Amazon Pantry box and they came in securely wrapped, no spills or anything like that. It's slightly annoying to get the first wipe out on each of them but once that's done, they're excellent wipes! Sturdy, very moist, and big enough to not have to use 2 or 3 for one job. Highly recommended!	&&&
These are good for a wipe off or for cleaning puppy feet. They don't do much for "dog smell", though.	&&&
I'm a new mommy again, forgot about the variety of wipes they've made and for our baby shower we received them all it seemed like. my husband and i prefer huggies over all the others. we like that they separate from each other easily without ripping. there also very durable they hold up to all the diaper clean ups, even the real messy ones. we prefer huggies so much more that the other wipes we returned and exchanged for huggies.	&&&
Just the right amount of wetness. Great product as always.	&&&
I love these. Bought them in the cucumber scent similar to the huggies scent since those were the wipes i used to buy and you know what i liked parents choice better! No only do you get more wipes for your money, they last longer and i notice i dont use as many when i clean baby up. I love these so much theyre great!	&&&
Pretty happy with the wipes when the purchase was new, but the tub isn't airtight and they dry out in no time.	&&&
Perfect portable lens cleaner. Just keep wiping until dry. Whole family uses them.	&&&
I purchased these for wiping the screens of my classroom Chromebooks. They work as promised, and one successfully cleans three or four screens. I even had students ask if they could use them for their glasses--so that was a bonus. The price was definitely right.	&&&
I had been purchasing whatever wipe was around for the best price. No more. I noticed a difference when I ran out of one brand and was finishing the task with the Clorox wipes. The grease was being dissolved very quickly and the slight ridges on the wipe were getting dried substances off that could not be removed by the other wipes at all. I like these because messes can be dealt with immediately. No hunting for the supplies, using them, and making sure they are ready for the next time. I keep a dispenser near those areas where messes happen.	&&&
Everything I send baby-wise is a gift. I do however use clean wipes myself to "freshen up" and I love them. I love the portability and if they have fragrance, it makes me feel confident as I know that at the end of the day perspiration can turn a little chicken-soupy smelling. Every mother I send these and other Pampers products has never complained, are grateful for the savings and I assume if they don't use them or at least all of them, they pass the remainder on to other moms who have babies. But the wipes as opposed to the diapers I usually send with them are a mainstay in my house. I do not throw them in the toilet as I know they clog cesspools so buyer take note. They do not dissolve in water. They need to be put into the trash.	&&&
Good deal for an cheap price.. The shipment was very quickly	&&&
They work great and leave zero residue on your glasses or whatever you're wiping. Definitely recommend!	&&&
I was excited to purchase this product but it turned out to be a waste of money. The wipes did not come out smoothly and they dry out. Enough said. I take the entire package the wipes come in with me instead. I'm better off taking the whole package then wasting a chunk of wpes using this case.	&&&
These wipes take off my mascara more easily than any other wipe I have tried. They don't leave my face feeling oily or filmy but clean and refreshed.	&&&
Great wipes.	&&&
"Huggies Natural Care wipes are our go-to wipes, because:
-They stay moist, unlike some of the other brands I've tried.
-They are a good price, plus there are almost always coupons available.
-Neither of my girls have had negative reactions to them."	&&&
These wipes work somewhat. When they dry sometimes it leave streaks and sometimes it does not. I not figured out what I am doing wrong.	&&&
easy to use. does the job	&&&
Great product	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! They are very durable. They are thick so when you are wiping, they do not tear. They also smell so great! I would recommend these to anyone!	&&&
The name is Natural Care and that is exactly what it is! I love that it is strong and durable without all that added products of ingredients to make this product. It's sensitive enough for the babies skin yet durable enough to wipe away the really dirty messes!	&&&
Just want I was expecting	&&&
Unbelievably good	&&&
awesome for good quick deep cleaning. buy these if u want the best.	&&&
I love these wipes, they are so much softer than some of the other brands.	&&&
The wipes are very wet and are wonderful because there are no chemicals or perfumes. The sack they come in, not so great because they don't pop up. You have to stick your fingers inside to grab a bunch out to use. Because they are such good wipes I will tolerate the poor packaging, until my LO starts resisting diaper changing.	&&&
I have 2 kids with VERY sensitive skin and these wipes don't irritate their skin, not even when they are broke out from loose stools. Price wise they are the same as another brand, but you get more in Pampers packages, especially at Sam's Clubs. I have no problem with using these on my kids faces even.	&&&
These were the first brand of wipes I used. I thought all brand had the same soft and flexible texture, but boy was I wrong! After trying Huggies wipes, that left my daughter's bottom red and sore, I vowed I would never use anything other than these wipes again. They are perfect and make cleaning up easy!	&&&
I have been using these wipes since my oldest son was born, 2008. I love the feel of them and the scent isn't over powering. I give these wipes as gifts for showers. I highly recommend these to anyone.	&&&
Pampers is outstanding. I wouldn't choose any other brand for my child [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Everything is perfect! Thank you :)	&&&
Great wipe for on-the-go travelling - whether car, stroller or to grandparents. Fits nicely in small backpack we use for a diaper bag.	&&&
The warmer works really well! My son hated getting his diaper changed due to temp differences when I took off the dirty diaper. This product stopped his crying by offering a warm and soothing wipe instead of a cold one.	&&&
Cleans the monitor surface very well. Gets all the dust. Even cleans the dried sneeze stains off my son's monitor. Much better than damp clothes. I sometimes use two at a time because my hands are so big I can't hold one against the surface without my fingers hanging off the sides. We like them.	&&&
i use this mainly for my toilet. i scoop my cat litter in the toilet since its flushable and use this to clean up. plus it's nice to have a clean underside of toilet for when males come over. i am a chick and don't lift the seat to pee but if i did i certainly would want to look at s*** stains on toilet seats.	&&&
I love pampers products. They are cheap and work wonderfully. The wipes are soft and moist and get the job done with fewer wipes needed. You could always find a brand that is cheaper than pampers but in the long run you'll spend more by using more wipes. Stick with pampers.	&&&
My husband and I absolutely love these wipes and won't use any others. Like me my daughter has extremely sensitive skin and the natural care wipes are non-irritating. Not to mention they can clean just about anything. In fact, they will clean greasy hands after working on the car like nothing else. Although my daughter is mostly potty trained now, we plan to keep Huggies Natural Care wipes on hand for some time to come.	&&&
My sitter likes these. I prefer a more soft texture. I also enjoy the smell of baby soft by pampers over these. However it's a user preference. Also it depends on your child's skin. My kids did not have bad reactions to these wipes.	&&&
I have used these for years and found that our grocery stores were no longer carrying this product. I was very glad to see that Amazon does have it. These reusable wipes are strong, easy to clean, and don't smell like dish cloths can after a day or two. They rinse out cleanly and dry quickly. I bought a two-year supply.	&&&
"These are so handy to have at work, where it's easier to clean using the wipe in the Mothers Room versus taking the parts to the break room or bathroom (ugh!) to wash. One tidbit though, I cut them all in half before using them. Instead of 24 wipes, I get 48, and half the size is still sufficient for all the parts."	&&&
I love this product, and use it in many ways. It is very useful around the house. Glad i purchased it	&&&
this baby wipes are amazing, affordable & very good quality. i love that my pocket doesn't have to suffer when it comes to baby care...	&&&
I have sensitive skin, and I purchased this after reading all of the positive reviews about this product. I purchased this during holidays, but I didn't use it until last week. The first time used, I got red rash all of very my face. I thought it might be some bad coincident. So I tried again couple of days later, again, my face started having rash. And it's too late to return this item since it's over 30 days. I even bought two bottles. Now they have to go to the trash can!!	&&&
"WONDERFUL FOR LATE NIGHT DIAPER CHANGES IN COLD WEATHER (JANUARY BABY)
DOES NOT DRY UP BABY WIPES AS READ IN OTHER REVIEWS"	&&&
Just mirroring what others have said: these wipes smell unacceptably bad. I bought the six-pack and then paid the hefty $11+ return shipping fee because there is no way I can have this odor in my life.	&&&
We keep one of these in every bathroom as well as the kitchen. Very easy & quick to wipe off counters & toilet & give a quick touch up to bathroom. Even my boys can handle cleaning their own bathroom with these.	&&&
We have been bathroom wipe users for quite a while and have bought everything from the cheapest to the most expensive. Recently I noticed these dispensers in the stores and ordered a set of two from Amazon. I was not disappointed. The dispenser is much more stylish than the traditional tubs found in most wipe systems and the wipes were pleasantly scented but not overpowering. I was genuinely surprised with the thickness and quality of the wipes. Most if not all of the other brands tend to tear even when you remove them from the tub, these are hearty enough to be pulled through the dispense mechanism and still hold up. Getting the dispenser loaded is a bit tricky when you first learn how to do it, but not so much than it can't be figured out. Refills are readily available and very well priced.	&&&
My favorite wipes. They're sooooooo soft and don't have the funny smell like Huggies wipes. Been using them since my daughter was born.	&&&
When my daughter started to get recurring rashes with no explanation, I changed her diaper to Huggies Snug and Dry\u2026 and then changed from the Target Sensitive Wipes to Huggies Natural Care and it made the world of difference!	&&&
for all my children i have used huggies products. I have 4 girls and all of them have been really sensitive to certain fragrances and chemicals. Seeing as my last child was 8 years ago, when i had my newest daughter, i thought id get right back to the same products. but for some reason, these wipes irritate my babies bottom, causing a rash. Iv always loved huggies products and would like to continue with them, but unfortunatly we didnt have the best of experience this time around	&&&
I boughy these wipes for quick bathroom clean ups. These caught my eye as they were flushable....first time I used them on the bathroom counter after applying makeup, I was disappointed. They ripped coming out of the package and it took 3 wipes for a small area.	&&&
My lil guy is 5 weeks old now and we've tried a few different wipes brands. Pampers sensitive wipes are our favorite so far! They are very soft, but clean just as good as the others.	&&&
Clean bugs in my windshield, front car, clean the grill, this is wonderful	&&&
Great time tested product	&&&
Don't be fooled by it's unassuming design. These lens cleaning wipes are highly effective tools that I use on a daily basis to remove dust, residue, and smudgy fluids from my smudgy electronic devices and smudgy screens. It's compact design may lead the buyer to believe that these wipes are not highly effective- this is an illusion. Buy these wipes or regret using something as archaic as a paper towel.	&&&
I have not had my child yet but I watch my nephew a lot and the only diaper that I buy him are the pampers swaddlers and I am expecting my first and that's what I will be using on my little boy due to the great quality of diaper it is!	&&&
This is the one come with Wipes Case in Changing pad.	&&&
These are the only wipes I use on my son. I tried to use another brand to try and "save money" and another type of pampers, but the sensitive ones are the only ones that seem to work the best!	&&&
I loved these handkerchiefs, so I'm doing my trousseau drinks away (Brazil) and not hand hand you have many of them. my baby protected and fragrant. I fell in love.	&&&
This product has made pumping at work so much easier. I am able to quickly clean my pump and get back to work. I have noticed a decrease in build up and smell since I started using these wipes. Love them!	&&&
The only other wipes I used prior to these were Huggies, and those were a little too abrasive for my liking. These wipes are nice and soft, and very gentle on baby's bottom. I also use these to remove my makeup and they don't irritate my skin.	&&&
Outside of homemade wipes and Honest wipes for travel, these are a regular purchase via subscribe & save. I send them to daycare for the month, and the amount is perfect and the price even better. My son has sensitive skin and eczema, but these don't bother his skin at all.	&&&
I have always wanted to try baby wipes for makeup. These work GREAT! Take my makeup off with ease, not annoying my skin. Put each wipe on my eye area softly for 5 seconds and the waterproof makeup rubs away with ease. Very impressed! My friend also uses this brand for her baby- Never has had a issue, is a great product. She really likes how thick they are, they get the job done. So for baby and makeup Five Stars!	&&&
Love wipes when they are moist and these stay really moist	&&&
These wipes smell like the spa. Perfect for my toddler	&&&
I love this premoistened wipes. Use those for my glasses and for my camera lenses. The way the wipes are individually packed is perfect solution to go. I have always few of them in my camera bag to get the lenses clean.	&&&
I needed a small case for wipes to carry around in the diaper bag, instead of carrying a big pack of wipes. So now I use this little case and it works perfectly for us. We are never gone from the house very long, do we don't need to many. And my baby is always with me, since I haven't went back to work yet. I like this product because it is small and fits right in the pocket of my diaper bag.	&&&
I bring these right to matches and hand them out to the boys when they get off mat. It helps because they cannot shower right away	&&&
"I love this wipes because is so wet"	&&&
I keep them everywhere. Now I no longer have to wait to get home to clean my glasses. Also use them on phone and tablet. They work great. You do have to work fast as they dry pretty quickly once you take it out of the package.	&&&
Easy to use and cleans well.	&&&
great buy!	&&&
I love the clutch concept along with the awesome designs. It is very easy and convenient to use and I can just grab it when I'm on the go.	&&&
Helps when my children have colds/runny noses to not make their nose irritated and dried out from using regular tissues!	&&&
"I have used these antibacterial wipes for years. They are convenient, and when I could get them in Sam's Club, I was very pleased.
It's disappointing when something you use all the time can now only be purchased online. Now I have to pay shipping charges, which makes it much less of a bargain."	&&&
"I've had issues with other wipes irritating my daughters skin, but not these. Huggies natural care baby wipes are so gentle on my daughters skin, I love them! Will never go back to the other brands."	&&&
"These wipe are thick and soft. They get the job done!"	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are a must have in my home. The convenience is unmatched. No other wipe on the market lasts or does the heavy duty job the clorox brand wipes do.	&&&
Absolutely the best wipes I have ever used. They are thick and no more than 1 - 2 needed even for a big dirty job! I big the large packs and never have problem with them drying out or the bottoms one being too wet. Perfect wipes!	&&&
Wonderful product, very cute packaging, and awesome pricing compared to other wipes.	&&&
"I use this product all day on my little when changing, wiping her face and hands. They are strong and wipe up everything they aren't slippery like other brand and get the job done. I will definitely continue to buy this brand."	&&&
These wipe are thick and soft. They get the job done!	&&&
"I got this as a gift, and its super cute, fits one refill pack easy in it. keeps wipes wet."	&&&
This product works great but the scent is so horribly offensive that it sometimes turns my stomach. I know that they use thyme oil but that is the only thing you smell. There is nothing lemongrass or citrus about this. I would honestly prefer a better scent or a scent free version entirely.	&&&
Wipes are OK, Dispenser sucks. It keeps jamming up. I would consider buying this if it had a better dispenser.	&&&
I use pampers products for everything. However i wish the wipes were a bit thicker. They are to thin, which makes it hard to pipe a baby butt like it should. Im not one that likes sticking my finger in babys bomd, because my wipe isn't strong enough. Yuck. Give me a thicker wipe that can handle those baby bomds.	&&&
These wipes are amazing and never cause redness or dry skin even when we I have to clean my kids multiple times in a short period of time. I use them for hands and face too! And when my daughter has a runny nose, they do not cause redness and chafing like kleenex.	&&&
I know there have been some negative reviews about these, but I don't see any problem. They work just like all the other Clorox wipes I've ever purchased, except cheaper than buying them in the store. I would definitely buy these again.	&&&
"i absolutly love these wipes, they do a great job in cleaning and leave no residue behind, i used to buy the from walgreens till they stoped selling them and replaced the with a walgreens knock-off of them, the knock-offs sucked.
very fast shipping and a great price."	&&&
I love this wipes specially when my baby is playing outside and I can't wash his hands	&&&
I am so glad about getting all three together. You can switch up and try a different scent. I will purchase these again.	&&&
We have loved Pamper's Sensitive Wipes since they were first released. My sensitive-skinned kids could only use wash cloths prior to that. And that meant I did lots of laundry. But now that we have these wipes, I don't have to slave away with the bleach and my youngest has a very happy hiney.	&&&
This product is great, comes with a snap seal.which is great because when u get one to use. You can rest assure that the unused wipes are kept moist. I use these to clean pacifier or bottle nipples. I find these particular wipes very useful and are small enough to fit in any diaper bag size or style, plus they smell yummy... ( they smell like berries) :)	&&&
They are very thick and work GREAT! Also, They have a very good smell to them.	&&&
I use these things all over, indoor and out. I like the multipacks so I can keep a jug in the garage, one in the kitchen and one in my office.	&&&
I love these wipes. Not oily or alcohol based. They just clean and refresh your skin. Best of all is the smell. Fresh and clean. I look forward to using them. Just okay for removing heavy mascara but works fine for a lightweight mascara. Cleans away any powders and foundations easily.	&&&
I love pampers diapers and wanted to exclusively buy from pampers for the most reward points. So, I switched from Huggies natural and I gotta say. They aren't has good as cleaning. I feel like that aren't absorbent at all and don't pick up a lot of what I am wiping up. Unfortunately I am going to have to switch back to Huggies natural wipes.	&&&
These work great and you get a bunch in this package. I also use them to clean my tablets and video game controllers.	&&&
These wipes are marvelous and they are so handy	&&&
I keep a pack of the wipes in my purse and car. I am sensitive to alcohol based hand sanitizer, this product is wonderful and gentle on my skin.	&&&
These wipes are perfect. Can be carried in purse, pocket or car to be used whenever needed. Easy to use and dispose of. Would not leave home without them.	&&&
We love this wipes because they are easy to pull them out and they mostly water	&&&
I bought these to use on my English Bulldog to clean his face wrinkles. First, These wipes have a VERY strong nasty odor!! It takes several hand washing's to get the smell off your fingertips so you may want to use gloves. Second, Good luck getting your dog to stay around long enough to apply the wipes. My Bulldog would not let me get close enough to his face to use them. I was able to wrap them in a baby wipe and use both together and seemed to clean well but again, the smell!!!	&&&
We love these. I'm sure you know how great these are, no review required!	&&&
These are the only wipes I will use. Any other brand will shred into a thousand soapy pieces at the poopy moment of truth. Very soft yet strong, no smell. I basically use them to clean my house too.	&&&
Good value.	&&&
I was excited about this product as I wanted a baby wipes case that would fit more than a small travel pack of wipes at a time (and one that I could attach to a stroller or anywhere else necessary). The clutch was fine for a couple of uses but then the plastic clasp unglued! I thought this was perhaps a defective item, so I bought one more. The same thing happened after a couple of uses, especially after being left in the car. Not worth the money.	&&&
Absolutely love these wipes! They are thick, durable, dye and alcohol-free. I am able to use just one wipe during most diaper changes because of the large size. I won't hesitate to fill my diaper drawer with these wipes! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
its great for those emergency situations	&&&
Are the wipes bleach free? Needed for back to school supply list.	&&&
Did what I needed it to do! Removed Tear Mender off my dogs fur.	&&&
Yes, they appear to be stronger ...BUT they smell awful...like stale beer or some sort of chemical...will not buy again!	&&&
These were my preferred wipes to use with both of my children. Both of my little ones were allergic to wipes and diapers and these worked wonderfully! They are thicker than other brands and sensitive enough to keep my little ones from breaking out or blistering. As I prepare for my twins, I will be stocking up on these wipes!	&&&
I use them frequently. Carry in my purse and on trips I pack a bunch. great	&&&
I find Wet Ones Sensitive Skin wipes indispensable in the bathroom for below-the-waist hygiene. For me, the best way to stave off a hemorrhoid attack is to stay scrupulously clean, so I'm a big user of hygienic wipes on a daily basis. I've tried so many other hygienic wipes that (despite their claims) burned my sensitive skin areas, didn't clean properly, and had too much or too little moisture in them. When I finally discovered Wet Ones Sensitive Skin wipes, I was thrilled because they have the perfect texture and moisture content and never sting or burn when I use them, plus the wipes are twice as large as Tucks pads and therefore much easier to use. For some strange reason, the Wet Ones Sensitive formula stopped being available in my town about 6 months ago. Thank God amazon.com carries these because otherwise I'd be in quite a pickle. If you suffer from anal fissures or pilonidal cysts but haven't found any hygiene pad or wipe you've been able to get along with, you might try this one.	&&&
These wipes are wonderful. Our daughter has sensitive skin like her mom. Natural Care is not harsh. Also, great for messy hands while on the go :)	&&&
Love these, gentle on my baby's sensitive skin. 1-2 wipes get the job done.	&&&
I really love the wipes after clean up of raw chicken these are the best Clorox Wipes and so easy to use you get cleaning and disinfect at the same time.	&&&
My family and I love Clorox wipes,we use these in the kitchen,bathrooms and outside we even use the wipes to clean our cars!	&&&
I do not leave my house without a pack of these. They are safe and clean off binkies very well.	&&&
Works well enough that plenty of dirty water ends up in the tank. The squeegee suction might be a little better so that is why I rated only 4 stars. Happy with this purchase.	&&&
These a re convenient and work well. I don't like using soap & water or my shirt tail to clean my glasses. I buy 600 or 400 at a time and keep them everywhere; home, car, messenger bag (purse), brief case, and work. No streaks, just always clean glasses.	&&&
Work well and smell nice. Great to use on baby's face without any breakouts.	&&&
These things are awesome. Pretty much multi-use. We use them for all kinds of things from baby bum wipes to bath time clothes. Even used them for a few things around the house.	&&&
I could write a book about trying to solve my severe case of anal itching/bleeding and fissures. I considered everything from pinworms to food allergies. Want to know the culprit for all my agony? Well, after 27 years of oral & topical steroids, not sleeping without excess Benadryl, and having horrifically painful bowel movements (to the point I went on clear liquid diets), I finally figured out that I'm allergic to three preservatives found in many brands of moist wipes. The two main culprits are the allergens methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone. You may or may not have his allergy, but be warned that many people do develop allergies to moist wipes. From the medical journals I've read, this allergen is more common that you might think and is often found in "hypoallergenic" and "natural" products. Please be careful when using these. If you get itchy, stop using them! I never in a million years thought I'd be allergic to moist wipes, but it turns out I really cannot use probably 90-95% of moist wipes on today's market due to this allergy. Ever since I started avoiding these preservatives by compulsively reading labels, I have a significantly better quality of life! I barely could function I used to be so itchy and sedated from meds!	&&&
They work great and a great price.	&&&
I LOVE THIS WIPE CLUTCH, PERFECT FOR THE DIAPER BAG!	&&&
Clorox wipes are the only cleaning wipes I will use. I have tried others and they smelled awful and didn't clean as well as Clorox wipes do!	&&&
Our babies have sensitive bottoms and get diaper rash easily. These are so soft and gentle that I don't feel worried about irritating their already sore bottoms. The other brands we've tried seem rough and almost coarse. I always felt bad using them when they had diaper rash. I definitely recommend these... I've also tried the one's for sensitive skin, but couldn't tell a difference.	&&&
Great product. I recently ran out and need to purchase some more. love the travel ones too to feel clean on the go.	&&&
I love this machine. Wonderful for removing the dirt instead of just moving it around with a mop! Very quick and easy to use. Love it! Pick up the dirty water and leaves the floors fresh and clean!	&&&
Great for sensitive skin. My son has sensitive skin and I haven't had any issues with any diaper rashes.	&&&
My whole family is sick except me and I swear it's because I've been using these multi-purpose sanitizing wipes while everyone else has been using paper towels to wipe the counters and their hands! I love the smell of these! It's a nice citrus smell and leaves everything smelling fresh! The wipes themselves are very soft but strong at the same time and have the perfect amount of wetness to clean! I would defiantly recommend these for the germ filled holiday season!	&&&
"These are the best wipes. They clean so well and neither of my kids have had any problems with them. We have been using these wipes every day for 3 years. Really can't go wrong."	&&&
I bought this Wet Ones Antibacterial Hand for my kids pre school teacher's class, they use them every day	&&&
"These things are great! One side is smooth the other a texture meant for heavy duty cleaning. I have used these in the kitchen, bathroom, camper, car, etc. They hold up to heavy scrubbing pretty well. Love that they kill germs in the process. The scent is a fresh clean smelling scent. The double pack will last you a long time. I have sent these with my kids to college for their heavy duty messes and they have asked for more. I like these better than the Clorox wipes due to the textured side for heavy messes."	&&&
"Very durable. Not very moist so several had to be used to fully clean."	&&&
My daughter insists on these wipes for her baby. A wonderful product.	&&&
Perfect for diaper bag! Keeps wipes moist, perfect size.	&&&
"I use these wipes for every part of my son's body and the smell of them is amazing."	&&&
I have no complaints. Plenty thick for me, no diaper rash for baby.	&&&
Terrible. Does no warm wipes properly: 1 second after you take one out it is cold already. I used it for 1 week and as I opened the dispenser to replace wipes (I have 2 babies), the insert was really mouldy! Very scary and disgusting to think I was wiping my babies with all that mold under the wipes. I returned it and Amazon was great for that ( I have Amazon Prime and they instantly gave me a refund). We decided not to buy another wipes warmer as it seams like a waste of money and very un-hygienic.	&&&
I have tried other brand wipes that were just too thick and dried out easily. They also didn't hold together well when pulling them through a wipe dispenser. Pampers wipes held up better then the competition.	&&&
"I love these wipes my son has such sensitive skin and these are perfect for him. though every baby is different my son got really red and irritated with generic brand wipes. So if you have the same issue then i recommend giving huggies a try. I also love i can buy it in bulk like this because when daddy is changing diapers he uses way more then he should lol in another note theses are daddy approved as well."	&&&
We always keep these for on the go cleaning. We are happy	&&&
Works better than the tail of your tee shirt. Looks "professional" in use. As is if you should care.	&&&
Awesome deal on great wipes. Have already ordered some more to have on stock.	&&&
Love these wipes They are gentle on the baby but tough on the mess	&&&
They are worth the additional cost as these wipes are thick and durable, which are great traits when you are cleaning up after poopy diapers.	&&&
I always buy Pampers Sensitive Wipes. They are way better than Huggies Natural Care, which are way too thick and smell nasty. I wish the Pamper's had a scent but the less chemicals, the better.	&&&
"First of all, I'm writing this after using the product for only two months so my outlook may change. However, so far I am extremely satisfied with this gentle cleanser. My make-up comes off easily and my skins feels so moist afterwards that I no longer use a moisturizer before going to bed. Because I have rosacea, I need a product that will not irritate my skin, and so far I have had no issues with the Aveeno exacerbating any redness or skin eruptions. Others have complained about the odor but I barely notice it -- although my husband once mentioned that it smelled quite strong when I got in bed.

As one who formerly only used a washcloth and soap to remove make-up, I felt a bit guilty about creating more unnecessary garbage with the wipes. ( I only began to use a make-up remover because I started wearing more make-up due to my rosacea.) To mitigate the waste problem I re-use each wipe twice by briefly wiping off my face with a wet washcloth first, and then using the Aveeno product. I store the used wipe in a separate plastic baggie and throw it away after the second use. While this really doesn't do much to help the planet, it assuages my guilt a bit.
my guilt a little bit."	&&&
it sucks! (in a good way) :)	&&&
These wipes were actually used by my sons, u s usually they avoid the "baby eipes" in the bathroom. They appreciated the flushability and subtle scent.	&&&
I have tried these wipes and they are excellent! Very durable and I like that they are healthy for my baby girl and the environment! Would recommend to all with babies!! Must have item! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
These wipes are the best! They are thin and soft like pampers wipes without all the garbage added:)	&&&
These towelette are smaller than the original towelettes. However, they do a great job of cleaning and treating my windshield.	&&&
My shih tzu has stinky face. These help tremendously and when wiped every day or other day, no stinky face.	&&&
I like knowing that I'm safely cleaning my laptop screen, however, the towels are so moist that I needed a dry cloth to dry it, because the cloth left streaks.	&&&
I first bought these facial wipes to use when I travel but I liked them so much that I am now using them at home too.	&&&
My son uses it after wrestling and it has kept his skin free from any skin issues. Recommend it for anyone in contact sports.	&&&
Started out using pampers natural care but switched to huggies natural care to see if like better. My newborn got a diaper rash from using these and how I know is because it started when I first switched and once I stopped using them it cleared right up. I was using desitin and such but it wasn't clearing it up. I won't go back to using these diaper as my newborn must be more sensitive to what is in the wipes.	&&&
I love this because I didn't want an expensive one that warmed wipes. So I love the way it looks, but unfortunately after just 2 months of use it doesn't close right anymore and I have to put something heavy ontop of it to keep the lid shut. Really disappointing. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.	&&&
"I love ordering wipes and diapers from amazon, many in a package for a great price!
I recommend for those that are looking for good quality and quantity for a non expensive price."	&&&
I'm always pulling something out of my jewelry box to wear at the last minute, usually silver, and it is almost always tarnished. These cloths make it shiny and pretty super fast.	&&&
We love the refreshing scent of this product. We are using it for our LO. Wipes wetness stays for a longer time.	&&&
These used to be thick and high quality. They have changed and are just as bad as target/Walmart wipes at a premium price :(	&&&
Although the processing was good and received on time, the product itself was a little disappoinring. They used to be wider and not as long. They used to last through wash after wash, but these seemed to shreda litlle sooner. I have used them for YEARS and will continue....just something else that has changed. :-(	&&&
I liked the previous version of it... it is thick but it does not feel good to touch compared to its previous model/version of wipes! But it is certainly better than others out there... :)	&&&
These are definitely the best wipes ive ever used! They are so soft but still get the job done. I love them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We do like the sensitive wipes however there tends to be inconsistency with the wetness of the wipes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
My daughter has never had a diaper rash in her life and all we use are these wipes and either swaddlers or cruisers diapers [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Not my choice out of sensitive options. Too thin and tear too easily and smell horrible. I'm pamper all the way except wipes (any of them). I feel like I have to use 5 wipes to every 1 Huggies Clean and Clear so not worth the money to me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I've used every style of wipes in every brand and pampers sensitive is what works best for us! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love how you can use them on the go. It's perfect for when you need to pump in the car or anywhere where you can't wash out all the parts!	&&&
They are soft and clean nice! Not like some of the other brands that fall aparr [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
So I did too. I use all the wipes but if I ever have to wipe my daughters face I use these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I like the thickness of this wipe. I take care of my sister who is incontinent. I don't have to use as many of another drug store brand. The price is great compared to other wipes.	&&&
Consider these a necessary evil of having warm wipes. Just wish they could come up with pad that was permanent.	&&&
Good for newborns but I wish they came a little bit warm so my baby wouldn't cry every time I use it on him.	&&&
"I currently own a bbgear and a fisher price diaper bag. Both I bought because I loved the wipes carrier that was so conveniently on the outside and could pop open and shut at ease. Both of those cases have broke, one from the baby pulling in it and the other fell on the floor too hard. I have been looking everywhere for a case to replace them and this is it!! It can fit in both bag's slots perfectly and with its own tether it fits on the stroller too! I love this. I had read previous reviews and was a little nervous so to be clear... 1. It does keep my wipes wet. I've been using it now for a couple months and have never had an issue and 2. The dimensions are 5x8x1.
Hope this helps!"	&&&
Love the 800 plus pack of wipes. The refill bundles fit great in the wipe warmer.	&&&
Really thin compared to the Clorox alternative. Seem to have to use more at a time to get up messes. With four children and a dog that adds up quickly.	&&&
These wipes do what their supposed to do. What more can you say. They are probably not great for the environment.	&&&
You can never have enough wipes around. Nice package to get. I keep them in my diesel truck to wipe my hands after filling up. It keeps you from keeping smelly gloves in your truck (or car now). Tip - they freeze, so bring them inside if you're in the cold weather states.	&&&
"I have used many wipes before, but Clorox is one of my favorites.
I love the cleaning power of bleach! I also have two dogs and a cat, and these wipes are easy to use and great at keeping mess away!"	&&&
I buy these repeatedly to keep by the porta pot	&&&
Soft and gently on my daughters skin. Easy to pull from package with one hand	&&&
Very handy to have for a quick, easy, sanitary cleanup!	&&&
Great for washing hands any where, any time, especially when away from home. Wipe hands before/after eating, wipe grocery cart handles or other devices used iin public places. I trust Sam's Club will continue to offer this product.	&&&
"Great choice especially for babies with sensitive skin."	&&&
"I haven't had my baby yet however I have used these on my face, when removing makeup and they are so soft! of course I will want to use these for when baby comes in March."	&&&
Works great! reduces my sweating. I work a very physical job and I'm able to stay dry. I have used on my hands, feet, underarms and forearms. Definitely recommend to all the people who struggle with Hyperhidrosis.	&&&
Plenty of alcohol, evaporates rapidly, no streaks. Unlike other wipes, I can use the same cloth for extra cleaning of my cell, computer screen etc.	&&&
Was glad to get them. Getting hard to find in stores near me.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the only wipes used in our household; ever.	&&&
Great price and these are my favorite wipes for baby.	&&&
"I love this item. The wipes are great and the clutch makes it super easy to store and grab when needed. I keep on in my diaper bag and one in each vehicle."	&&&
These are amazing my niece has these has I love them they work great and she don't mind them which makes it easier on her	&&&
I love these! I use these for everything- as personal wipes, cat clean up wipes (sometimes he needs a little help cleaning because he's very fluffy), makeup removing wipes and cleaning the insoles of my sandals. I do brave a trip to walmart for these and try to go in the morning haha. They're very moist, mild, durable and thick, takes every bit of makeup right off and way cheaper than actual makeup remover wipes. Leaves skin feeling clean. The only thing is, they're pictured as 3 packs but they really come in just one resealable bag as a refill pack, which I don't mind. Less waste. Excellent quality and unbeatable price. I like these better than even the big name brand baby wipes.	&&&
The price was such a great deal. I am so glad that we purchased these while I was still pregnant. Our son came a little early and he had newborn rash so our pediatrician advised us to use cloth wipes with warm water until it cleared up. My son is breastfed and these wipes do the job for bf poo! We purchased a small laundry basket from a dollar store and ordered a wet pail liner to line the basket with and we toss the soiled wipes in the basket until it is laundry time. Some of them have stains even after washing, but who cares when they're for cleaning up soil! They are soft and have held up going on 3mons now.	&&&
"What baby likes having a wet, cold wipe touching their skin - especially in the middle of the night?
We used this product for all of our kids and I love purchasing this for others. As long as you fill it only 2/3 of the way up with wipes and add enough water to steam and continue to replenish the water on a daily basis, this will work perfectly!"	&&&
"You've got to experience getting baby wipes delivered direct to your door with Amazon Prime 2-day free shipping. What a difference over buying them in bulk from the big box stores. We are talking about a whole new level of freshness which really makes an improvement over how effectively the wipes clean. Instead of pallets of baby wipes sitting in warehouses and drying out, Amazon Prime moves merchandise lightning quick and the difference has got to be experienced to be believed. It's that wonderful.

Huggies Natural Care 648 count baby wipe refills provide three large inner resealable packs and one white, undecorated tub. Our household has tubs in every room that constantly need refilling, so it's nice to be able to order in bulk and have truly fresh packages of wipes that are actually moist instead of practically dried out. These wipes are capable of gentle, yet highly effective cleaning, are hypoallergenic, fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and also contain aloe and vitamin e. The price can't be beat, not even by the big box stores. At a unit cost of around 2 cents, Huggies Natural Care is not only a tremendous bargain, they are also our household's best friend. Whatever messes life hands out to us, Huggies is there to clean it up."	&&&
Works great, they are soft wipes, they smell great and the pack is very stylish. I would use these on occasion, and would have used them more but the price is a little high for me to buy all the time. "	&&&
Pamper wipes are the best compared to other branded wipes i used in the past [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These are gentle enough to clean a babies bottom and also clean a messy face and hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
these are a great smell for cleaning baby up and making them smell wonderful. But would not recommend to be used in wiping hands or baby surfaces like highchairs up the smell can be a little wrong.	&&&
MOST FAVORITE BUM CLEANING WIPES, SMELL GREAT AND I USE TO KEEP A GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE. NEVER HURTS TO HAVE A GOOD SMELLING BUM AND A CLEAN ONE AT THAT! PREFER OVER CHARMIN BRAND WIPES, BECAUSE THEY SEEM THICKER AND THE DISPENSER IS BETTER THEY DON'T RIP AND ALWAYS PULLS ANOTHER OUT AFTER YOU USE ONE.	&&&
This is a good moisturizer cream. I would recommend it to anyone, especially is you have any blemishes. I have been using this product for a while. I have been pleased with the product.	&&&
Best, safest, and most healthy baby wipes ON THE MARKET. Nice scent, no chemicals, nice size... L O V E these!	&&&
Have been using 20 months now and still loving it. Keeps wipes moist and soft. The sponge will turn brownish is u don't keep water In there as I believe it burns slightly but it can be cleaned. We are very pleased.	&&&
I bought this before and it was perfect but this time it arrived in a separate box and was missing the 2 travel size packs. strange. other then missing a few packs product is great	&&&
Easy to carry and use. I can take them with me and never need to worry about being able to clean my hands.	&&&
Their Super soft, best wipes I've used so far!!!!!!	&&&
I tried the wipes on my computer screen and they worked just fine and dandy!	&&&
I love this brand of wipe. It comes in a convenient pop up container, the wipes are very soft and smell good.	&&&
Husband loves his Dude Wipes. I got it for him on a whim, having never heard of it before - just based on reviews here on Amazon. Feedback from husband was that these are "great". He's an avid athlete and these come in handy for him. He said he even mentioned it to his male colleagues. So, it sounds like he might prefer these to the baby wipes he's been using.	&&&
Only wipes that don't make my son break out best wipes ever?	&&&
We love the wipes, but the container is a bit tricky. We find it tears the wipes as we pull them out. The opening is very snug so it keeps the wipes moist, but we find that they tear no matter how carefully we pull them out. SO...we put them in a different container. We buy in bulk so we are refilling anyway. Not a big deal, but something to consider.	&&&
I love Tarte products and these are great wipes from them! They remove eye makeup very well. They do not make my eyes blurry like some other eye makeup removers which is a huge plus! They also do not leave an oily residue behind which I love.	&&&
They smell so good and work just as good as any name brand wipes for half the price! These are the only wipes I use.	&&&
I travel a lot and can't live without these wipes on airplanes for eating trays, in hotel rooms to wipe the remote and phone, and just traveling by car. I love their size and how moist they stay for long periods of time or in the heat. I always make sure I order them and stay in supply.	&&&
Simply Perfect	&&&
Through the years, I've tried several different brands of lens wipes with mixed results. But the one brand which has always worked well, and has been consistent from batch to batch are the Zeiss wipes. These are the best I've found. I keep a few in all of my vehicles, keep some in my office and take them with me as I travel....very convenient to have around. I have given many of these away over the past several years, and have quite a few others now using them on a regular basis.	&&&
Bought a bunch of boxes of these wipes when on sale for black friday. not worth it...their baby wipes are extremely dry and have to use double the amount to clean a regular diaper. I was stuck with a ton of wipes i hated to use, basically gave them away	&&&
These wipes are a good size and nicely moistened.The price is very competitive for the product and truth be told a bit better than the pet stores. We like them a lot and intend on purchasing again. Give them a try!	&&&
"use for baby's bottom, face and other body parts! soft, strong, and very durable. use for all of my children."	&&&
Perfect product for little ones. My niece is enjoying her new bibs. My sister is enjoying easier cleanup. Thanks Rainy Day, LLC.	&&&
"I used this product in the morning, afternoon, and night and I still got the same results.I would find myself using the wipes that we were using before we purchase this.

The good thing about it that's it's compatible
with a number of the wipes.

What I feel isn't good about this warmer is that it will not keep the wipes warm at all, as soon as you take it out it's cool.And I do understand it is just a warmer.I was not impressed at all. I was told by my niece not to get it but I did anyway, her girlfriend experience the same thing.

Needs to be able to hold heat longer."	&&&
Great price, and fantastic quality. The wipes are well moistened with witch hazel and are nice quality wipes. I wouldn't flush them though - they seemed too thick. Offered great relief from burning!	&&&
Good wipes for babys	&&&
"These have been my favorite brand since my ten year old niece was a baby, and they have been my first choice with my daughter as well. Both my niece and my daughter have sensitive skin and the simply clean are the ones that have worked the best to get them completely clean without causing rashes. They don't rip or slide all over the place like some other well known brands and they work great as a one and done type wipe. We've tried other brands depending on sales but I never use the whole pack of the other brands because they just don't work the same. Huggies are also the best if your kids draw on stuff because they are wonderful to get anything off, including permanent marker off them:)"	&&&
I do not know what I would do without these! My elderly pug has diabetes and neurological problems and my floors would be a disaster otherwise.	&&&
"I've been using this product for a week now. It's doing the job so far. The pad underneath tends to dry out in about a week so it is important to follow instructions and keep it wet. I wish the night light had a switch to turn it off. I would definitely recommend this product."	&&&
As excellent as seen. Every time that I want to clean up my glasses I buy these cloths. I recommend.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes. I love the smell, the container patterns are cute and they don't dry out my daughters skin.	&&&
When sams club stop producing wipes we decided to purchase these. Sure, I feel better using them on my kids, but I hate their smell! Thank God we are about to potty train!	&&&
nice thick wipes. one wipe does the job!	&&&
"I love the texture of the wipes and how they feel so natural and soft on my baby. I also they have no scent or chemicals so my baby does not get a rash, he has very sensitive skin."	&&&
"Sanitizing wipes are basically gold in my apartment. I have a faulty immune system, so staying minimal on germs is really important. Unfortunately, most wipes leave your hands dry and cracking in this cold weather season. These don't, however! I love that they feel as soft as baby wipes with the same power of my usual brand of disinfectant! They have a pleasant smell and do a great job of cleaning up.
Each canister has a huge supply of wipes! I think the quantity is great and the quality doesn't suffer. All of my wipes had a good moistness to them. The lid seals well and I feel confident that these wipes will keep sanitizing my world for quite some time to come.
P.S. These make a great teacher gift for your child's classroom. Flu season prevention is a truly helpful gift. :)

I received these to review in exchange for my honest opinion."	&&&
This was perfect so I could have a couple extra cleaning cloths available and a small refillable glasses cleaner that can go in my briefcase and still have the large bottle at home if needed. Always cleans the lenses really well. Had this before and loved it. Highly recommend.	&&&
We like to slip one of these into the diaper bag for on the go, however the purple 'lid' is held on with very little adhesive and ALWAYS comes off. it is more of an annoyance than anything else. The wipes come out ok and do a fine job. I don't have much experience with other wipes to compare them too however I have not noticed them to be too thin, nor have an issue with how they smell (being on my 4th pregnancy, I have a pretty picky nose). My only REAL issue is the packaging on these! We have made our 'choice' to switch brands, though I wouldn't "NOT" buy these again.	&&&
These wipes work, obviously. However the smell just reminds me of a dirty diaper. Why is there a scent at all if they are supposed to be sensitive? Shouldn't they be unscented?!	&&&
I am a picky person who is constantly looking for a better product. I have used higher end products such as Lush that carry huge price tags, desperate to make my angry, dry, bumpy and red skin happy. Many products have worked temporarily but with changing climates and the incredibly cold Vermont winters, nothing lasted...until this. Seriously. I love this moisturizer. It is also small enough to toss in a bag if you are going for a walk or a hike in the winter and you want to keep your face from drying out. It is great. I have also mixed it with my foundation for a smoother and less-flaky application. I hope they never stop making this.	&&&
The sides of this case do not close completely , my one Dollar case I got from Walmart is better than this one!!!	&&&
The price of the wipes are great. However, I have such a hard time trying to get these out of the package or to separate from each other. When you are a mom on the go all the time, you need something that you can quickly grab without the hassle or without having them rip. I think overall for the price, I think they are a great deal--but not my first choice."	&&&
Huggies are awesome wipes. The count and quality for the price cannot be beat. I will never buy another brand.	&&&
I love how quickly these wipes dry! I've been using them for years and they are still the best product out there for cleaning up the kitchen.	&&&
These wipes are very thin and flimsy. They are also hard to pull apart. I'm not impressed. I've always used Huggies wipes and these definitely do not compare.	&&&
I initially bought these wipes because when I went to the Lip Lab in New York, the wipes they had were incredible, and they said they were these. Of course I wanted to pick them up if they work so well. I was a little disappointed in these though. They work, but they are very small, and they don't get all of my lipstick off in one go. I don't have exceptionally large lips, so it was definitely a bummer.	&&&
I love the convenience of these wipes. They work great when my 3 year Olds hands are a mess and even better when my 1 year Olds entire body is a mess.	&&&
"These work very good,my daughter prefers Huggies brand so when I buy I buy Huggies."	&&&
This is an awesome product. I've used these now for a riding season and would recommend to all my friends with high end bikes. I have a high end carbon frame with high end components and I don't hesitate to use these wipes on a daily basis. In fact I've purchased 3 packs and gave them to my riding buddies and they love them. Also, the unused wipes seem to stay very fresh in the package.	&&&
very happy with my wipes	&&&
Does the job perfectly!	&&&
Good price, good wipes.	&&&
Great scent and works well!!	&&&
"I prefer these wipes over all others. My son has a sensitive bottom and these have helped so much in the last 5mths. Plus its a great price for the box."	&&&
Great product!! I care for my 91 year old mother and these wipes have been a wonderful help in so many ways. I primarily keep them in the bathroom where I use them every day for quick messes. I also like to use them in the kitchen to keep my counter tops extra clean. They have a nice scent and are not rough on my hands. I know my surfaces are clean after using these wipes. I find them also helpful cleaning my cell phones, TV remotes and door knobs. I feel this is a great deterrent to ward off colds during the winter.	&&&
"Love it as it is inexpensive and let you know when to change the diaper. Love the wipes, its not so watery, just perfect!"	&&&
I'm a say Sephora brand makeup wipes perform pretty well and are priced very affordably. I've purchased this makeup remover several times and I have no complaints other then the wipes can be a little bit more moist.	&&&
"I've used many brands and types of flushable wipes, but these are by far my favorite. I'm very sensitive to fragrances, and I really like the scent of these wipes.

They are soft and thick, with just the right amount of moisture, and I can fold these over multiple times to get 2-3 good wipes out of each sheet, without any tearing. This is way more comfortable and clean than using dry toilet paper."	&&&
"I bought this product because our new home has only tile and wood floors. I thought it sounded like the perfect product...all-in-one, easy to use, great for easy cleaning.
I'm underwhelmed. As a vacuum, it's very marginal. I can run it right over dirt and it just leaves it behind. We do have one dog, and the dog hair seems to really get in the way of the rotors and suction. As a floor cleaner, it's pretty good. It took me a while to get the hang of distributing the spray, but it seems to do an adequate job. The drying function, however, seems almost useless. I barely see any evidence of the water being picked up, which is a problem if you happen to over spray.
I am not thrilled with it overall."	&&&
"Everything is great"	&&&
"i use it every where i have one in my purse one in each car i put one in my kids bags when they go to sleep overs its jus so conventent. i totally love it..."	&&&
I keep these wipes everywhere from my car to my house. I love clorox wipes!	&&&
I'm a big fan of Boogie Wipes so I figured it was a good deal to get the jumbo container but I was disappointed by the quality of these wipes compared to the ones in the smaller packages. I think I'll continue to buy the smaller packages since the wipes are bigger and thicker.	&&&
I love all of the pampers wipes! When it comes to cleaning the are perfect and they are just the right amount of softness! I have noticed with huggies wipes they aren't near as soft as pampers! Love them! Especially the baby fresh because of the light scent but it's not overly scented so it's still good for my sons sensitive skin.	&&&
i really like the product would love to buy again and recommend o my friends!	&&&
Best of the best for our little princess - we only use the best and these are the best	&&&
This is the best lens and glasses cleaner out there, bar none..... No streaks at all...none !	&&&
Baby's bottom is always clean and smooth and protected from unwanted bacterias	&&&
"These are great when pumping on the go. They are just expensive hence the 4 stars and not 5."	&&&
these are the wipes that I prefer to use because the fresh scent of them and the way they work on my son	&&&
They smell great and are gentle on our little ones nose and the fact that they smell great our baby doesn't mind us cleaning her nose. I like the big pack because we go through a lot of them when they get sick and the sizes are smaller than the smaller pack, that seem like a waste because their nose is so small!	&&&
I love the thick and sensitive wipes. Wet enough to clean up mess but not too wet to have residues like some brans	&&&
The only wipes that i will use, these kind does not break out my daughter [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I actually prefer these over Huggies and Pampers. I've tried them all and these are by far my favorite. They don't irritate and the price is right.	&&&
no worries about what we are putting on our babies skin. a soft safe product to use! Love them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
This to the trick and they smell awesome plus they are alcohol free	&&&
These wipes are pretty good for what they are. There is no scent (awesome) and they get the job done no matter how messy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
"Bought these from a promotion, and I was regretted I bought them.
For the same brand, the big giant ones from Costco have better quality.
For some reasons, these Lysol wipes were so wet...very wet and I do not like that condition at all. It caused a lot of mess when I swipe my table indeed."	&&&
Used one for the first time last night! Wonderful, catches dropped food, and is super easy to clean!	&&&
Soft, gentle and easy to use wipes	&&&
"These are great. I use them for cleaning up messes on the floor in between mopping, pet accidents, or doing a quick toilet rim or sink bowl cleanup. I hate cleaner smells and this product smells natural but also gets rid of odors without leaving a floral or chemical smell behind.

I'm a natural cleaners kind of person (I use diluted Dr. Bronner's, baking soda, or bleach water for almost everything) and I'm skeptical about most cleaning products because I just don't find them effective enough to justify their prices, all the plastic waste, and the chemical impact on the environment. But if something needs to be disinfected or deodorized this is my go-to."	&&&
We have been using these wipes for 5 years now. They are they best out there. Pampers are too slippery and others aren't thick enough. These are just right. We use them everyday for everything! Even after the kids are grown I see these being a household staple for us.	&&&
I bought these to use in a middle school classroom. They stand up to the rough use and dirty jobs. They get up marker stains, glue, etc. Unlike other products, they aren't dripping with chemicals -- just moist enough to do their job effectively. Students are more willing to use them given their soft texture, and the smell is pleasant, subtle, and clean instead of being astringent, noxious, or overwhelming. I will definitely be looking to buy another one when these run out.	&&&
this is the best baby wipes i used it doesnt irritate baby skin it cleans well and gentle enough to use on face hands ect #1 baby product	&&&
Can't say enough about these wipes. Huggies makes the best wipes and the scent is refreshing.	&&&
Finding the best product for your newborn, is a little nerve racking. As a first time mom, I worry about allergies, sensitivity, and durability in wipes and diapers. After trying Pampers sensitive wipes, I feel they've nailed it! The wipes are strong, have a light, refreshing fragrance, and are softer than other competing brands.	&&&
"I love these wipes! Soft, fresh and feels good for skin. I must admit, I use it also for taking off my make-up. :)"	&&&
"This is great to have around my house! It fits perfectly in the bathroom and right next to the changing station where it is easily accessible when I need it!"	&&&
My daughter has no issues with the diaper.	&&&
"This product is such a perfect balance of clean and gentle. I only use Huggies brand wipes and this is by far one of my favorites. Raving reviews for this full time mommy."	&&&
Excellent for home or travel...very little fragrance....perfect.	&&&
Just as good as wet ones - I actually prefer these wipes. The canister also works much better than the wet ones canister. I would highly recommend this product. it is an incredible deal as well. You won't be disappointed.	&&&
Great on the go and super convenient, but i prefer pampers wipes.	&&&
My son has sensitive skin and these wipes are the best. I have never had issues with this brand. I wont use any other brand. Huggie faithful	&&&
I am a papmpers mom at heart, but huggies wipes have won me over. Green Tea and Cucumber - how cool is that!	&&&
I bought these for our office to help combat the dreaded cold bug that is circulating around. The wipes are easy to use and smell good."}},	&&&
It took me forever to find a fragrance free hand wipe. I keep some in both cars so we have them when needed. I always through a few in when going hiking. If you have scent sensitivities these are great - there are some natural scent in there but they don't trigger my migraines or asthma.	&&&
Pampers wipes are incredibly soft and gentle for baby skin. The softness can almost make it difficult to clean well, but they do get the job done. The wipes also have a pleasing scent. I would recommend.	&&&
Very moist, easy to get the wipes out, and have a very mild to no scent. Wipes are thin but strong and work well without having to use a million of them on one diaper.	&&&
These wipes are great for baby's face and hands too. I love Pampers.	&&&
This is a product our house uses a lot. We have been getting case lots in warehouse stores, but they come with additional dispensers, and after the first dozen who needs more? This is just the wipes, and that is just what I want.	&&&
These are by far the best wipes that I have used on my son. They are very soft and my son has never gotten a diaper rash or irritated from using them. I also like that I do not need to use a ton when he has a solid diaper.	&&&
I received a free sample of these wipes and liked them. I wouldn't use them as my everyday makeup remover because I don't feel like they do as good of a job as a liquid cleanser/remover but they are great for easily removing makeup after a late night out. They even remove my waterproof mascara.	&&&
It's good not great, it takes awhile to remove my mascara (not waterproof). I would rather opt for a normal make up remover or cleansing gel.	&&&
I had been looking for wipes that were gentle enough for the eyes, yet able to thoroughly clean my face too. These wipes fit the bill. We do a lot of traveling and camping where being able to easily wash my face every morning and evening can be difficult. These are the perfect size to through into my overnight bag and never have to worry about not being able to clean my face. I did receive these wipes for a discount as a trial in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	&&&
The wipes I received looked slightly different from the ones that I purchase in stores. The box was already open, and when I opened a wipe, they were very dry. There was practically no moisture on the wipes to clean anything even lenses. When I have purchased them in stores, the wipes have always been very moist. Very disappointed with these.	&&&
These are really great for poopy diapers ! When my little girl started eating baby food , these really helped !	&&&
I was very pleasantly surprised by these wipes. I bought them on Amazon Prime Day for a steal. I was apprehensive, but for the price I decided to give them a whirl. With disposable wipes, I usually have to pick which features I like and I cannot get them all in one wipe. Until now. These fit my preference to a T. They aren't too thick or too thin. The little circle texture is just right. They are strong and don't tear, yet gentle on bottoms. The scent is light and fresh. They really are great for sensitive skin. Other wipes give me a slight burning or tingling sensation, and these do not. Yay! 10/10 on this one, Amazon.	&&&
These wipes are perfect for after bjj. I have a 40 min drive after class and these wipes are great to clean off as much as I can before I can get home to shower.	&&&
"this package comes in a big size and has more wipes compared to the ones sold at walmart! smells great!
affordable! its a must BUY here at Amazon! get yours now ;)
thanks amazon"	&&&
It works okay as wipes, but has a strong smell.	&&&
I usually use Seventh Generation wipes and have been for years. I love the amazon ones and will be switching to them for full time use. The sensitive ones don't have any odor at all and they are much thicker and nicer quality than seventh generation. They also seem to have very similar and nontoxic ingredients to the Seventh Generation.	&&&
I have one of these in every room . I also have 11 dogs , which explains my fondness for the Lysol wipes .	&&&
The best wipes out there	&&&
Sanitizing Wipes for Hand and Surface. 150 ct Extra Large Alcohol-Free. These are really good smelling and they don't have a bad smell; the wipes were very soft. I would invest in buying these Softy wipes. The communications with the company are awesome they will answer any questions you have; also they ship out very fast I highly recommend this to everyone A++. I received in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	&&&
"I watched several presentations on these wipes and finally gave in... So glad I did !!
They are so gentle,so moisturizing and get the make up off so so easy, even heavy eye makeup. What a great product, thanks Josie."	&&&
"Best brand of wipes- the only product that doesn't break out my daughter's diaper area in a red bumpy rash.
With diaper wipes you truly do get what you pay for!
Nevertheless, a great deal for wipes!"	&&&
Wow, did not expect this container to be so huge! I thought it would be as big as maybe the lysol multipurpose wipes but it was even bigger than that maybe a inch taller and wider. I did receive this product in exchange for a review. Nevertheless this is my own experience and opinion. I love the scent of these wipes and how they are made in the USA. I've been taking care of my sisters 1 year old for a few days while she's away from business and these came at a great time. I like they are great for your hands as well and alcohol free. They don't have a chemically smell and work great when cleaning up. They are sturdy but not as thick as I thought they were going to be. All in all these are a great product!	&&&
Great value!	&&&
I purchased these bibs for my toddler, they are awesome. Easy to clean, cute and they fit him perfectly. Catches all the mess so that it doesn't pile up in his lap. Great for babies and messy toddlers. Also works great as an apron for craft time.	&&&
great product	&&&
"This is a nice product. The only issue I had with it was the fact it did not take the old dry erase ink off my board very easily. I had to scrub my board hard to get it to come off. But it works great for fresh ink that is on there."	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes have been my go to brand sanitizing wipes for several years now. I always stock up on clorox wipes because i have kids in the home and it helps when cleaning the house to disinfect things.	&&&
Best baby wipes for my baby! I have Tried a couple of other brands and so far this is the only wipes that my baby's sensitive skin loves :)	&&&
I used Pamper's wipes with my 1st son, but after trying Huggies thick, soft wipes with my second I was not switching back...they have worked the best for us.	&&&
These are great. They smell wonderful, have the perfect degree of moistness, and I don't have to worry about using harmful chemicals on my infant's sensitive skin. I will continue to order these!	&&&
I tried these for motorcycle riding in the PNW. In this climate, cold & humid, these wipes do not work.	&&&
I do like these wipes, they easy to use and not so expensive. We tried different brands before but they weren't as good (too dry or too easy for tearing them up). But this product does just right for us	&&&
I have used wet ones fresh'n flush in the past which I bought at my local store. I recently moved, could not find them and ordered on line. I think that they are superior over other brands.	&&&
excellent wipes but just too many of them but they were sent as stated and I am happy with my purchase	&&&
I use these when we are out and about, or around the house ! These are perfect for a diaper bag, purse, or swim bag! I even use them myself sometimes! Even useful to wipe down a dirty kids side of table at a restaurant!	&&&
I have Used this item for a few years. So have some of our friends, all of us like the product and use it often . It comes in handy when eating out or for cleaning hands without water.	&&&
My grandmother bought these to use at her house. I find then to be very soft but hard to use on a number 2 diaper [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Good product. I always carry some of these in my bag to clean my glasses. Don't keep them for too long though because they may dry up.	&&&
I love them only thing I dislike is how thin they are! If they were thicker that would be great!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love pampers wipes. They were the only wipes that did not leave any rash on my daughter when she was a baby and also held up nicely without tearing on tough jobs. She is older now. However, our family uses them for the # 2 deal since they are cheaper than flush-able wipes. They are scented well enough that no one ever has a clue we use them for that, even though they are just placed in the trash can by the toilet.	&&&
Product is fine, but discovered that these didn't have a resealable sticker on the top. Have to be put in the tub. That's annoying and impractical b/c like most Mom's, I grab a pack for my car, diaper bag, etc. Now I pay extra for the box of Pampers Sensitive Wipes. Those refill packs have the resealable sticker on each individual pack.	&&&
"We started out using this line (Thick & Strong). I've read that others prefer the original, thinner line. Not us. This line is the only one we will use. I accidentally purchased some of the thinner ones and my babe got a rash. Never a rash with this Thick & Strong line. It also feels like it's actually cleaning her bottom rather than just spreading stuff around. It is definitely personal preference and probably worth trying both.

We use the OXO Diaper Dispenser and I've found that these pull out easier than the other, original line of wipes."	&&&
I use these wipes daily for little one. They have a refreshing scent and it not only looks clean when i am done but smells clean. They are very soft and leave the skin feeling smooth.	&&&
Nice and soft and absorbent. I prefer these over the osocozy wipes which are too thin. I wish I would have bought another pack but wasn't sure if I would like them.	&&&
"These were wayyyyy better than I expected, and at a great value through Amazon.

I bought 2 dozen(2 packs) at first - and after using them, I bought 2 dozen more.
They work as wipes, wash rags, and small burp cloths. They're the perfect material for every type of soiled diaper.
They wash great with cloth diapers (you have to know how to care for your stuff).
They fit perfectly in my wipe warmer. The material is thick and durable.

This is just an all-around great product. Even if you're not cloth-diapering, I'd still recommend them as wash rags for every day baby messes as well as bathing.

And they cost less than cheaply-made wash rags!
You can't lose.

(Pre-wash all baby products before using them)"	&&&
I have a newborn who shivered and cried during changes because the wipes were extremely cold. I decided to purchase this item and when I did I was extremely disappointed in the price (over $30.00) and disappointed at the fact that it does not even warm the wipes enough. Lastly, by the time you grab a wipe and use it on the baby, the wipe is cold again. I haven't had it for a month so I can not tell if it will dry out the wipes. At this point I will not be surprised if it did.	&&&
I like Huggies brand. Other brands just don't seem to work as well.	&&&
"This is not an overmoist wipe, which depending on your preference and use could be either a good or a bad thing. While they are not dry, they are dryer than other brands. The moisture is not oily, and the texture is comfortable.

There's no lingering smell with these, and the smell of them is just light and clean (not overly pleasant, but it is light and fades). Wipes are sturdy and thick.

I do love Seventh Generation products in general, and I would (and will) likely buy these again."	&&&
LOVE these wipes. I have been using them for a few years now and just love them. They are strong and don't fall apart and are very gentle on my child's skin.	&&&
I absolutely love this product. I love how it is not as bulky as a hard wipes case even when it is filled with the same amount of wipes. I have never had a problem with wipes drying out in this pod. I had an issue one time with the pod opening after I zipped it but that was because I over stuffed it. I took a few wipes out and no issues since. This does not take up a lot of space in my diaper bag which is one of the reasons I love this product.	&&&
I first opened these, and accidentally tore off the part that keeps them sealed. I wish this was easier to prevent. The wipes themselves almost have a polka dot pattern - except the dots are raised. They don't have much of a scent, which I prefer. I thought they felt dry at first, but after using on my face I could tell that they had the perfect amount of moisture. One wipe easily took off all of my makeup - even my eye makeup. It didn't burn my eyes like some other wipes have in the past. They felt soft, but not too soft. The twin pack is a great value as well. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and the opinions expressed here are entirely my own.	&&&
Sensitive wipes should not burn when you use them. I could figure out why my daughter was throwing a fit when I changed her. I tried a "mommy" test. These burn. Do not buy the sensitive wipes if you really need sensitive or if you have lady bits to clean.	&&&
TERRIBLE FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!!! my entire face is covered in small rash like bumps after using these wipes for two days, face is sore and inflamed and red! RUN! :(((	&&&
I recently had surgery that required a cast and thus no showering for six weeks. I ordered this product based on the reviews I read and it really lived up to its promise. The wipes themselves are nice, thick, and a good size so that way it was easy to clean my body. The smell of the cleaner is a nice citrus and is not overpowering. I found that it cleaned well and dried nicely with no residue. I highly recommend this product to anybody that is forced to clean this way.	&&&
I can honestly say it's better than the Honest wipes!	&&&
"These are the smallest and thinnest wipes I have ever used! They claim to be better than the Huggies and I found them to be worse than the Wal-Mart brand. They are hard to hold on to and like to stick to my baby's butt when I am trying to wipe, so I end up sticking my fingers in poo. GROSS! They have a gross smell to them too - blah!!!

Buy the Huggies or Kirkland (Costco) brand wipes."	&&&
These are great wipes! They smell great and aren't too thick or thin, will definitely be ordering again!	&&&
"I think it's a bit weird that these are labeled as eye makeup remover wipes, yet they also offer exfoliation. I don't want to exfoliate around my eyes or on my eyelids ... ouch. As a makeup remover in general, it works great. I like the gentle exfoliating nubs on the one side. They do make my face feel cleaner than just baby wipes would. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy, and didn't cause any breakouts, so it's a win in my book!

I bought this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
They look feel and SMELL LIKE BABY WIPES. So go ahead and spend more money on smelling like a feshly changed infant. Ill rock my b.o. and feel like a REAL DUDE.	&&&
"These anti-fungal wipes are a life-saver!! My dachshund had ""hot spots"" on her hind legs and back paws from summertime allergies that we just could NOT find her relief for! :(
Our vet gave us these wipes with an Rx to order ketochlor shampoo and a round of antibiotics and over the course of what has now been a few months (and a second, longer round of antibiotics) she is HOT SPOT FREE and has grown all of the fur back on her sweet little legs/paws!
I included all the detail because I know how lost and desperate I was to find a solution (it took 3 visits to 2 different vets before we got a solution), hopefully this review helps someone else to help their sweet little friend!
Specifically to the wipes: we used them in conjunction with a cone collar so she couldn't lick. I still haven't found anything that says it would be dangerous, but we like to veer on the side of safety.
We used the wipes on all affected areas- around her legs, in her armpits to be thorough, and between her toes/under her pads - after every walk outside, 2-3 times per day.
Now that she is doing so much better I still keep them by the door for the occasionally messy/snowy/wet trip outside for an easy and quick-drying clean up, so she doesn't sit around wet and feel compelled to lick! And they are a great ""dry bath"" for her feet and arm pits between baths!"	&&&
"This is a great product to clean with, great for the cold and flu season. they are so handy."	&&&
Sanitizing Wipes for Hand and Surface. 150 ct Extra Large Alcohol-Free. These are really good smelling and they don't have a bad smell; the wipes were very soft. I would invest in buying these Softy wipes. The communications with the company are awesome they will answer any questions you have; also they ship out very fast I highly recommend this to everyone A++.	&&&
The perfect solution for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Thanks	&&&
Love these wipes and the price was really comparative to other places so a good bargain	&&&
These wipes I stock up on in my home and at the office, I wipe everything down with them , and its so simple!! Keeps everything sanitized!"}},	&&&
The wipes leave a wet residue at first but drys well.	&&&
They are soft and strong, and the mild fragrance is perfect. The shea butter prevents tender skin from drying out.	&&&
Clorox Wipes are my go to when it comes to cleaning and disinfecting just about any surface in my house. Having 4 kids, I depend on Clorox Wipes to keep my home bug free and the kids healthy!	&&&
Work as advertised. Great for travel.	&&&
Throw away your Wright cream polish. These wipes are applied dry on your wet silverware. Where have they been all of my life?! I liked them so much they will be stocking stuffers for the girls on my list. Easy enough for a boy to use.	&&&
I prefer these wipes over all others. My son has a sensitive bottom and these have helped so much in the last 5mths. Plus its a great price for the box.	&&&
Nice that toxin free but wish they were way more more moist. Have to use up so they don't grow bacteria which is expected	&&&
Great concept but why do all of these natural wipes smell like poo?	&&&
"Easy to use, with great smell."	&&&
"I brought these wipes for my son and they work good they smell good and I like them cause their not too wet or too dry
They work perfect for me"	&&&
Makes it so much easier to hold tumbler. Glad I bought it!	&&&
My babies love them!they like go use wipes but they aren't flushable so we switched to	&&&
"Boogie wipes are awesome! We have been using these for our daughter for most of her 3 years now. These are much more gentle on her little face than plain tissues as well as being much more effective at wiping away any dried Boogies (yes let's call them what they are!) These are soft and gentle on the face and that may be the most important benefit. Adults understand how annoying it is to have a snore nose from constantly blowing and wiping during a cold. Kids dont' understand why this is happening, they just don't like it! My daughter actually looks for to having her faced cleaned with these. Now at age three she actually asks for them by name when she has a cold. These are also good on Mommy and Daddy's hands as they leave no residue unlike regular tissues with aloe.

I would have given these 4 1/2 stars is that was an option! I have no real issue with the fresh scent variety of Boogie Wipes. The scent is very light and non-offensive. However our family prefers Boogie Wipes Saline Nose Wipes, Great Grape, 30-Count (Pack of 6). They have a much stronger scent but we actually like that. To the parents it probably makes little or no difference but my daughter loves the strong grape smell that is similar to Welch's Grape Juice. The scent is part of the positive experience for my daughter. I will stick to the grape scent although functionally they are exactly the same."	&&&
Other wipes I have used just fall apart if you look at them wrong. These actually function as old school wipes did and all wipes should. They actually stay together! With most of the other brands you would be better off just using toilet paper!	&&&
Forever, I bought cheaper wipes for me and my family...and were they EVER. Cheap, I mean. Not only were the price(s) some of the lowest for this type of product, the quality, size, effectiveness, moistness were less than anything acceptable. What was worse is that I actually PAID for wipes like that, over and over again. Then, like the wrestler who said, "Hey, if I just don't get in the ring, I won't get jumped on..", I stopped wasting my money. I saw these and decided to pay the few pennies more, just to see. Well, was I ever pleasantly surprised: they were bigger than ALL THE REST; they were softer yet stronger. I only had to use one instead of the usual two or three to get the job completely done. I STRONGLY suggest this brand. I didn't get any rash (as what happened with 2 of the cheaper ones). I am very sold on this brand...forever. Always remember, especially in the case of wipes, you get what you pay for; just don't let it be over 'n over 'n over.	&&&
These wipes, from Huggies, never fail to perform on children and adults, alike. Wonderful product, time and time again. Kudos to the workers who strive for a great product, they've mastered it.	&&&
We have been using these on our newborn. No rashes and they hold up well. I'm not doing backflips but they seem like a standard wipe and get the job done.	&&&
I find Pampers wipes are the right thickness for manageability (Huggies are thicker but I don't feel I have as much control). Pampers might be slightly larger too, but I haven't measured. My three kids who all had sensitive skin had no skin problems with these wipes. The packaging has changed a bit recently and I really like the soft pack with the hard plastic opening - makes pulling out wipes one handed much easier and the plain packaging ones always rip which means the seal isn't as tight and the wipes don't stay as moist. At home we always use the tubs for dispensing. I highly recommend these wipes.	&&&
We have been using these pads for years and can vouch for their effectiveness on our two German Shepherds' teeth as a complement to a daily tooth-brushing -- however, this is the first time that a vendor ("Fat Happy Pets" in this case) has sent us these pads -- we bought several containers -- with their tops loose and with all the containers holding pads that were dry, not wet with saturation of the product's active ingredient.	&&&
Huggies Natural Care wipes are the best. They are cloth like and not to wet. We buy them by the case from our local warehouse club store. Nothing else for our little one!	&&&
Good wipes. Thick, soft and definitely don't irritate my daughter's skin. 4/5 stars cause I am really not a fan of the "smell" of these unscented wipes.	&&&
I really love the Yes To line of products, but these wipes were a fail for me. They barefuly removed my powder foundation and I had to soak them with eye makeup remover to eliminate mascara residue (not even waterproof). I've used other wipes from Boots and generic wipes that performed much better.	&&&
Wipes come pre-packed in disposeable containers. During diapers changes, the container is easy to pop the lid open, and removing wipes is effortless and easy. Sometimes a couple wipes come out at a time, but that works in my favor since I almost always use more than 1 wipe during a diaper cleanup. The pre-packaging in the light weight plastic containers are BRILkLIANT! Whoever thought of that deserves a raise. No longer do you have to refill your large and clunky wipe containers yourself, they've done that for you. You have made my life easier because of this invention, Thank You :) I will purchase only these wipes for the rest of my life, the price, quality, and conveience doesn't get any better than this.	&&&
I started buying these instead of Clorox wipes because Clorox wipes come in that devil death trap container that clings to the wipe you're trying to get out like a mother being dragged from her children, but immediately drops the next wipe in the queue back into the container, requiring that you stick your fingers in there to fish it out, only to realize you've just put your whole hand in the Chinese Finger Trap of household cleaning products. The more you struggle, the tighter it grips you. Damn I hate those things.	&&&
"I really like these wipes. They are very sturdy and the material feels soft but also tough and definitely deals well with big messes. It feels like I can gently scrub with them without any worry that they will not hold up.

Two minor complaints is that my husband noted that they are not as wet as other wipes we've tried. I realized that the start of a pack is less wet, but it actually gets more wet as you use the pack so I get why he complained but I don't think it's a huge problem myself. The other is that the material is maybe too strong because I like ripping wipes in half so that I can use half a wipe for a small mess but that's not possible with these.

Overall, I am very satisfied though because they are really nice wipes."	&&&
I use this for my camera, laptop, glasses, etc.. really useful	&&&
My little one prefers MAM pacifiers, so we opted for the MAM pacifier wipes. I'm pleased with the product and keep a package in my diaper bag at all times. They aren't too wet or too dry and easy to get out of the package. They also are reasonably priced and some of the cheaper ones.	&&&
These wipes are great, and very effective in keeping me dry . They are portable , gentle and smell great. If you have sensitive underarm skin, these wipes do not cause any irration . The smell is tropical, clean and fresh !!!!	&&&
"You really need to know some basic algebra in order to know exactly what you are buying. For starters, this is what they call in the diaper business as a ""13x multipack""; Yes this sounds like something from one of those trek wars or hanger games movies. Alright let's try and work this out together. For all you troglodytes out there, 13x implies there are 13 times (something) amount of diapers in here. What is the something?

Well continue reading. ""808 count"". What does this mean? It's basically smarty pants jargon for ""808 diapers"". Let's put this all together.
The ""something"" from earlier, lets define as variable Y. 13 x Y=808. Little deevide.. and you find that Y = 62.153846 (etc)

ATTN: Pampers advertising crew, could you please include that the full equation defining how any diapers are in your box? Also, 808 divides very cleanly by 4 (202). Oh I just read there are 13 packs of wipes included. Thats probably what 13x means. Nevermind all what I wrote."	&&&
very satisfied with these wipes.cleans well.no allergic reactions.but i am not too fond of its smell, although they say it does not have a scent.	&&&
I love having professional disinfectant wipes for my home. I'm a germaphobie and using these make me feel like all is right with the world.	&&&
Great thick wipes ! It smell wonderful !!	&&&
Nice wipes and my daughter loves them.	&&&
Too many harsh, unsafe chemicals	&&&
These wipes are very handy and very easy to use. They also don't have an overpowering smell.	&&&
These wipes are absolutely wonderful. My child has an allergy to aloe and these are the only wipes that I have found that do not contain aloe in them. They are very soft and clean very well. I'm very pleased with them and would definitely recommend them to others.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great to have around the house. I keep one canister in each bathroom and one in the kitchen. Great for quick clean ups and to just wipe down door knobs light switches, etc. for germs and during flu season.	&&&
The Clorox wipes are great for cleaning the stove top area and also the kitchen counters. Always keep these handy.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes in our kitchen & bathroom. They're quick to grab & easy to use! The price is reasonable too.	&&&
These are super thin. Would not buy again. I prefer the one and done wipes.	&&&
I use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to clean around the house. I am a teacher and also use them in the classroom to clean student desks. They are especially effective during cold and flu season!	&&&
Cleaning wipes are easy to use and I know I am disinfecting too.	&&&
I have 3 teenagers that don't always clean off the counters but if I have the Clorox wipes, they use them. I love the lemon scent!	&&&
I have always used clorox products and when they came the wipes I was pleased.	&&&
My kids do the chores after dinner and I found that when they used to use a spray it would go everywhere except the counters! Now, we use the wipes to clean all of the kitchen surfaces with no extra mess. I love Clorox wipes!	&&&
"I love these wipes, they are very convenient. Easy to use and always on hand.
I mainly use Clorox wipes to clean surfaces around my house"	&&&
"Background for this review: My pug's nose wrinkle was getting infected, so I bought these, hoping that they might help. Unfortunately, they didn't quite perform as I'd hoped.

1. They smell VERY strong. It's not exactly a bad smell, but it's very harsh - kind of like vinegar.
2. They seem a bit abrasive. Every time I'd use these, my pug would go nuts. He'd run around rubbing his face on everything. I think they might sting a bit.

After a visit to the vet, I stopped using these wipes and switched to Ketohex wipes. Ketohex smells a LOT better, the little wipes are softer, and my pup doesn't go nuts after each cleaning. I use them twice a week, and (per the doc's suggestion) I cut them in half so the pack lasts a lot longer. You can do the same with these if you're cleaning a small area, I guess. In my experience though, the Ketohex wipes are less abrasive, less smelly, and more effective."	&&&
Being a busy mom with 3 boys we are always on the go. Clorox wipes is a very convenient way for me to keep germs at bay, at home and on the go.	&&&
I use this product daily. at work and at home I always have these wipes near to clean up any and all spills!	&&&
I love the convenience of the wipes and the results!!!	&&&
I liked the wipes, they were inexpensive, easy on my newborn's skin and had a pleasant scent. My only complaint was that I tried to put the wipes into a dispenser, and they would often come out in clumps or not at all, requiring me to have to dig into the container to get them. Not a big deal, but that was the only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars.	&&&
I got these wipes because I wanted something gentle for my little one. They are all natural, which I love, but they are not that soft. The material they are made of is quite stiff so if he is at all rashed I can't use it. I wish the wipe was softer to the touch.	&&&
The feel and the smell are great. They are so soft on little bottoms.	&&&
soft on me booty and booty hole like angels made of feathers were playing sqaush in me outback the whole time	&&&
want to save money for wipes just as good as the expensive one buy this brand I guarantee you will not be disappointed	&&&
We ONLY use Pampers products!! Made the mistake of using huggies wipes that we got from our baby shower, and our little one got a terrible diaper rash!!! Immediately threw them away and got stocked up on pampers never letting that happen again!!	&&&
My daughter broke out in a rash with any other wipes. However, when we began using Pampers Sensitive Wipes we had no more problems and stuck with them ever since and for the rest of our children too!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
quick delivery	&&&
When my daughter was a baby which was almost 6 months ago, i didnt like pampers too much. It seemed to dry out fast and didnt feel thick enough. I was only using huggies wipes. But when i had my son 4 months ago, i was introduced to pampers sensitive wipes at the hospital. It felt soft and moist and got the job done well on dirty diapers. Ever since then i have been only using pampers sensitive wipes. Best wipes ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Soft and right amount of moisture to gently clean undercarriage [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
How did I live before these wipes were sold in stores? I have multiple open canisters of these in use at the same time - 1 in the kitchen, 1 underneath the bathroom sink, and 1 at my desk at work. They do a great job of cleaning and disinfecting.	&&&
Clorox wipes cleans up the tough messes, and sanitizes everything!	&&&
I love cleaning with the ease of wipes. Great on counters after cutting raw poultry, wipe and throw away. The same with cleaning the toilet	&&&
i enjoy the easy convenience of clorox wipes..they are great for everthing	&&&
Clorox wipes are very helpful in helping my kids keep their bathroom clean.	&&&
Clorox wipes are super easy to use and get the job done fast in my crazy pace of a life that means I get more time to myself!	&&&
I like Clorox wipes. I use them every time I clean. Feel naked without them.	&&&
I love clorox wipes because they clean very well and they are convenient. I can clean any room with these wipes. I also love the fact that I can take them with me.	&&&
use Clorox cleanup wipes daily in the Kitchen and around the house and couldn't get by without them.	&&&
The Clorox wipes are life savers especially with kids. The travel packs helps clean and disinfect germ and dirt in the car. Highly recommend to have some on hand.	&&&
The wipes clean good leave a fresh smell and help keep from having to wash dish towels and cloths from spreading grease.	&&&
My husband likes it when we have Clorox wipes on hand for easy cleanup around the house.	&&&
Clorox wipes clean really well and they are very easy to use, We will continue to use the wipe.	&&&
"i use it as normal
i started saw a shimmer on the wipes i started wondering what it was looked it up it has fiber glass are you kidding me that hurts adults i dont care if there is not alot in it. my baby started getting a rash i stopped using huggies now it is fine you are not good people if you think that is okay!!!!!!!"	&&&
I wish the wipes pulled out the next wipe, but otherwise the wipes themselves are fabulous.	&&&
We used to use the "popular" brand of diapers and wipes bur my son broke out in rashes so we switched to natural.We gave Seventh Generation a try and we will never switch!Since using these wipes, my son has not broke out and it also doesn't take many wipes for his clean ups!	&&&
It smells very good and leaves a fresh sensation. I always try products on myself before I use them on my children those wipes amaze me.They feel nice on your face unlike some other wipes they do not burn.And the price is amazing for the quality of the product.	&&&
I love these wipes. They get the job done they are nice and thick the smell omg so awsome and my son does not break out from them.	&&&
These wipes remind me of pampers wipes. If you prefer those over huggies i think you would like these pretty well.	&&&
"For years I've been a loyal Target brand wipe user. I have tried other brands but they have all just been too thick or expensive for my liking. But on a whim, I decided to add these to my cart and I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. I love these wipes! They are thick but not stiff. They are strong so they don't tear. They don't bunch up when you're trying to pull them out. And they're stacked well so that a new wipe always pops up. I don't know how many times I've gone to grab another wipe in the middle of a messy diaper change only to not have one pop up. So then I have to dig for the next wipe and end up pulling out a wad of 10 and using way more wipes than I needed to. That doesn't happen with these!
My one complaint would be that they do get a little too wet towards the bottom of the pack. But, as my mother-in-law mentioned, wouldn't you rather they be too wet instead of dry? And I would have to agree."	&&&
I am extremely picky concerning products for my baby! That said, I love Seventh Generation Free & Clear Wipes. They are thick, sturdy, and are plant-based. There's plenty of moisture on the wipes to take care of the job, too! I have to add that I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I tried these when my 4 month old was a newb. They are awesome wipes. But, my lo's bum doesn't do well with thick wipes. They would be perfect if there was a sensitive (thinner) option. But for now, my hubby and I use them :-)	&&&
"They're alright if you have to use them and have nothing else but I wasn't that impressed with them.

They were drier than Huggies diaper wipes that we like and use all the time and also had to use twice as many wipes to clean the diaper messes up with these wipes.

I just tried them for a few dollars so it wasn't a big loss but I won't be buying them again. I will be sticking with what works best for us with Huggies wipes."	&&&
"I love these wipes and have bought them multiple times, but it really annoys me how they stick together. It's as if the wipe cutter at the factory wasn quite sharp enough to cut them into separate wipes, so when I try to grab one while one handed, a whole long chain of them pulls out. Seventh Generation wipes are thicker and easily pull out individually, but these are a good natural option if Seventh Generation isn't available."	&&&
These are my go to wipes. I prefer to use the "sensitive" formulas, and these are much better than the Huggies variety. Other wipes rip, as these have a nice stretch to them. I definitely use less wipes when using Pampers Sensitive. I recommend these to other moms as they are best wipe out here in my opinion. Great price...especially if you put them on subscribe and save!	&&&
My daughter has eczema and is sensitive to the products I use with her. I have tried all brands of wipes and these are by far the best! I love that there is no scent, but they are also strong enough to handle all the messes my daughter can make. With other brands, it seemed just a little lunch time messy face was a five wipe job. With these, it's easily a one wipe job. These wipes are worth every penny. Say goodbye to the thin wipes that do nothing for you and get these!	&&&
these wipes are great! my husband and i use them in place of regular generic bathroom wipes. they do not make a lot of fragrance free stuff for adults so we ended up with these that are much more gentle for sensitive skins.	&&&
I purchase Lysol wipes every time Amazon has a reduced price. They are great for every room in the house. The wipes do not leave streaks. I have young children in my home and using these helps keep my home sanitized.	&&&
Huggies brand wipes are thick and moist, but not dripping. Perfect for cleaning baby bottoms and all the other messes they make.	&&&
For the price these wipes are amazing! I am not a huge fan of the smell, but it is very light and not overpowering. The dispenser it came with is ok. I prefer to use a empty Pampers container instead.	&&&
Pampers wipes are the best.. Very easy storage , clean fresh smell!	&&&
We love the pampers sensitive wipes. Gentle, unscented and tough. We use them for diaper changes, cleaning hands and faces, emergencies for the whole family.	&&&
These wipes work just as well as the chemical kind but are gentle on baby's skin. I would recommend keeping them in a container though to keep them from drying out. I use the Oxo tot container.	&&&
Good, sturdy wipes that get the job done! They occasionally leave little fuzzies behind.	&&&
If I could give you 0 stars I would! Your wipes discolored my 1 years old skin tone! She is diagnosis with post immflammatory hypo-pigmentation! Her skin hasn't gotten worst but surely her skin torn hasn't restored it's color. It's been almost a week! Please call me Amazon like you promised!	&&&
Clorox products are so simple to use and I use them on a daily basis. With three messy kids in the house Clorox wipes especially help me with quick clean ups!	&&&
i always use these wipes to clean up my messes! they are the best	&&&
We love the wipes for a great clean that keeps our home safe and clean	&&&
Clorox is the best. I have the Clorox wipes in every room of my house. I use the bleach for all my white loads for laundry. The wipes are convenient.	&&&
These wipes work great! I use them on everything and they have a great smell!	&&&
I always use clorox wipes for cleaning my office at an elementary school and they work great! Haven't gotten sick all year!	&&&
Clorox wipes work great when I'm in the garage working or after cutting the law. I keep a pack in my car also.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I keep a tube in each of the bathrooms and in the kitchen. I love the convenience of just pulling out a wipe and cleaning multiple surfaces. Clorox wipes are the best!!!	&&&
They are awesome! The wipes are definitely handy for cleaning up after our kids!	&&&
I love this product not only does it get my counters and other surfaces clean but it has a fresh smell also which is very important. I definitely prefer the power of clorox wipes on my surfaces.	&&&
Love Clorox Wipes! They clean so well and work on almost everything! Thank you so much!	&&&
"I was given the Skip Hop wipes dispenser at my baby shower and originally was using that one. I liked it as it held a lot of wipes but my biggest problem was with the bit red button on top. It made it hard to put into my diaper bag or purse without sliding it open and/or popping it off which in turn would dry out all the wipes.
Frustrated with dry wipes all the time, I found the OXO dispenser and love it! It's slim and fits into my purse well and doesn't pop open. I find that it doesn't hold as many wipes as the Skip Hop, but for me the pros outweigh the cons. This particular dispenser will get a lot of use from me!"	&&&
"""I purchased two packages of these wipes before I returned to work. I use them to wipe down the desk area before I pump and then use an additional one to wipe the pump accessories after I'm finished.



They work fine: you wipe down your flanges, and other parts you can reach with your fingers and wipes. You then let it dry and can use the pump accessories next time you need them.



They are basically a disinfectant wipe, which is alcohol and bleach free - but they use ingredients found in other antibacterial products. I was expecting it to be something more I guess. I use them every time to wipe down the desk before I pump, but will probably purchase a less expensive wipe next time - like seventh generation with thymol. Being alcohol free doesn't really matter since it evaporates off. Alcohol is a more reliable disinfectant in my opinion."""	&&&
These wipes get the job done..even the big messes! Leaves my DD's bottom fresh and clean.	&&&
I usually go for all-natural products but I could not find any flushable all-natural wipes that dispense well and are not too pricey. The ingredient list in these is mostly long chemical names, but none that I recognize as hazardous. They do contain alcohol, and my daughter says they burn her skin a little (no visible effect), while the all-natural-but-terribly-dispensing ones I sometimes get do not.	&&&
Bought these wipes primarily to keep a few in my bag for cleaning off my mat at yoga class. They smell like fresh rosemary, no joke. Also, very strong, I was able to wipe a whole mat with one back and forth a few times without it falling apart, and plenty of cleanser on them as well. Really great product, I was pleasantly surprised!	&&&
very bad product! made my face break out and my skin started to feel very weird and very patchy and had redness. Don't recommend anyone to use this!	&&&
i didnt like the quality!	&&&
My kids are all potty trained but we use wipes for traveling and personal things. This was a great deal for these and I've always loved pampers!	&&&
I bought this tooth cleansing tissue for my baby, and thought it had three packs as written in its name. But actually it was only one pack.	&&&
they work really well for my sons extra sensitive skin. I love these [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes are my absolute favorite wipes to use on my 6 month old. They are the only wipes I buy. I would highly recommend these wipes for many reasons. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes are great for sensitive newborn skin and for taking care of diaper rash. Very soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
"I got these cloths & used them on my laptop today. They are definitely worth the money I spent on them. I have 2 boys at home and there always touching the tablets, phones, computer, laptop, & TV screen with there dirty hands! So these will come in handy & I will definitely be ordering more too and I'll make sure to tell everyone about them too. The shipping was nice & fast too I ordered these on Friday and they came on today which is Sunday!!

Disclosure: I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
These wipes sting like crazy. It takes a while for the affect to wear off, it's like a light burning sensation. My skin is super sensitive, and it hasn't hadn't any other real reaction aside from the stinging, but it's a lot to get over. I also wouldn't say these wipes are capable of removing your makeup fully, even with two wipes. Eye makeup/mascara especially seems to always have more to remove after use. Not my favorite.	&&&
We have tried many toilet paper products over the years, however, when I started buying Cottonelle, this has become my preferred brand. It's soft, but yet durable, because it's a little thicker it lasts longer than using a lighter weight product.	&&&
Great cleansing wipe. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and gives it a brighter appearance. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 starts is due to the strong rosy scent. I wish it were a little more subtle.	&&&
I've tried many brands, but Pampers far exceeds my expectations for the quality of wipe. Gentle, yet strong enough to get the job done. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These are great for quick cleanups. My son gave me a new idea to use on grimy IPhone screens and computer keyboards. I take them to work for my phone and keyboard. We all know how many germs float around offices.	&&&
"These would be better if they weren't so darn small. If they were the size of a baby wipe they'd be 100 times better when it comes to cleaning my little dog's teeth. Bottom line: they are too small to be useful. If they actually clean the dog's teeth and freshen his breath I'll never know it because my dog won't cooperate.

The problem is not the size of my dog. My dog is small. But he's got a tongue that can move more ways than a Reno lap dancer. While I'm trying to wipe his teeth he's wrapping his tongue around the teeny little Excel Dental Wipe which he believes is a tasty morsel brought to him by the good people of Amazon.

Don't be so cheap, Excel ... make these things bigger. They're simply too small to be practical unless you have a dog who likes to stand quietly and patiently with his mouth wide open while you carefully wipe each and every tooth with a teeny little cloth. (If you have such a dog, I'm guessing you got it in your ceramics class or at a Myrtle Beach gift shop while on vacation)."	&&&
I have been using these wipes for a couple of years now and sometime during that timeframe they changed them. At first I wasn't happy with the change because the other wipes were a little smoother but these are certainly thicker and strong wipes that have held their moisture.	&&&
Great product. Works as designed and smells great	&&&
I bought this product to use while backpacking where there was no place to bathe. The wipes were ineffective in removing the days sweat and dirt. I still felt sticky and dirty when I climbed into my sleeping bag. I found it just as effective to wipe myself down with a damp handkerchief.	&&&
Never used Pampers wipes before. These were on sale so tried them and won't ever buy again. They are slimy, have a very strong scent, and very thin. Have to use about 3 times as many as I would with Huggies wipes or Wal-Mart brand wipes.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes! They are super easy to use, so I always keep them in the bathroom and in the kitchen, so that i can be ready at all times to clean up a mess when it happens!	&&&
The answer is no! With Clorox disinfecting wipes you not only get that easy feeling of the trusted name brand but you are put to ease knowing that all germs in every room (and objects) are covered. From a spill to disinfecting baby toys, Clorox is the name I trust to kill every germ in my house....and then some!	&&&
I love using clorox disinfecting wipes my bathroom smells so clean and fresh	&&&
I buy these hand wipes all the time and carry them in my purse. I prefer these over the hand sanitizer since I can also use them to wipe off other things, in a pinch. Ordered them as a set since it was cheaper in bulk.	&&&
love the product. I use the wipes everywhere. Kitchen bathroom door knobs counters etc	&&&
Clorox has been in my family for years. I figured if my grandmother and mom used it I would too. It is a great product to whiten dingy whites. Also a great disinfectant for tubs, toilets and counter tops. I always worry about raw meat/blood leaving bad germs on the counter top but I just use Clorox wipes and don't worry about it any more. Definitely a trusted brand.	&&&
I really like clorox wipes because they are very easy to use and they work really well in cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. I use them on my counters all of the time.	&&&
Clorox is so dependable and their wipes are no exception.I like using a wipe for fast yet thorough kitchen or bathroom clean up.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes with my kids and am very happy with the messes that they can clean up.	&&&
My whole family uses clorox wipes. If I send the kids to clean the bathroom or the kitchen this is the first thing they grab. We like that you don't have to mix anything up all you do is just grab and go. The smell is also a plus. We will buy these again and again.	&&&
We used these wipes for my firstborn and found ourselves returning to them again for baby number 2. They have no strong odor - a requirement for my husband AND they contain no harsh chemicals which is a high priority for me. They are softer than Seventh Generation which I find a little abrasive on sensitive skin. I would prefer them to be a little thicker. Other than that, my only complaint it that they often stick together, making it difficult to pull out additional wipes in a messy diaper change. Overall a good option if you want a natural baby wipe.	&&&
I like the wipes, they fit in your bag so they are nice on the go for a mom to have because kids touch everything!	&&&
This is the way to buy clean wipes, they are less expensive, and easy to use with the refill container.	&&&
"I love using the Clorox wipes (Lemon) in the kitchen and bathroom. Especially to clean up the counters in the kitchen and I would recommend the to everyone to use :) Thank you,
Tracey"	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are a great cleaning tool and are available at a great value. I would recommend them for anyone who is looking for convenience and value.	&&&
We tried other brands on our first baby - but found Pampers sensitive to be the absolute best for his skin. With the new baby that was one less thing to worry about & knew that Pampers sensitive was the choice! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Perfect for a quick clean up at a restaurant or ice cream date. Can be used for clean up or even a more gentle hand santizer for a baby after an event. Easy, mild, and works great with my little ones sensitive skin.	&&&
Very good wipes for the price. Every other month delivery works fine for my usage. Price is good for it's quality.	&&&
I have bladder and bowel issues due to ms and I love these flushable wipes! They are soft and strong.	&&&
I Wish they were thick like Huggies. They tear so easy.	&&&
they work really well for my sons extra sensitive skin. I love these	&&&
I do love these! They're unscented and the perfect amount of moisture. Other wipes are usually too wet or too dry. I just wish they had more of a texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes have single handedly helped my preschool classroom to survive this brutal flu season. Tables, chairs, refrigerators, door handles, everything in the room is easily cleaned and disinfected. At the first symptom of a cold or stomach bug, we break out these great wipes and get all of our surfaces clean. I use these in my home as well. Now here is the catch, you will pay for their performance. These retail at one to two dollars above the leading disinfecting wipes.	&&&
The wipes are indeed pre-moistened in their own packets. About 3 wipes get pretty much all of the oils off my lenses.	&&&
These wipes are horrible for wiping poopy bums. There is no texture to give any "grip" so you end up using a 10 wipes at a time. These are very expensive since you end up using more of them to get the job done.	&&&
Product not same as descriptions said I return.the iten and got the different box but it was same as old one	&&&
We really enjoy these! We keep them with us all the time for our glasses & sunglasses - makes things crystal clear!	&&&
Does the job without needing tons of wipes. I like the smell. My kiddo has sensitive skin and it doesn't cause a rash	&&&
I bought the sensitive wipes and I love them. Comparable to name brand wipes. I am not sure how what the price difference is since I got these on sale. I need to look into it.	&&&
I cannot believe I am writing this review! I love these wipes they are amazing I used the hippy dippy delivery brands for a very long time and thought that they were the best, they are not, these wipes are! they were a hundred times better	&&&
I got these as a free sample for review. I loved them because they are chemical free, and they are thick enough to take care of the mess! These wipes are our preferred go-to wipes for everything from messy faces to dirt-covered hands AND the diaper area!	&&&
I love these wipes I love how its not too wet or dry its a perfect mixture of moisture. And my daughter does not break out with these. I absolutely love these wipes .	&&&
I LOVE CLOROX WIPES BECAUSE THEY ARE READY TO USE ON A CONVENIENT CONTAINER AND ARE REALLY GOOD AT CLEANING UP MY BATHROOM WHEN MY DAUGHTER IS TAKING HER BATH. Thank you for making such a wonderful product!	&&&
Amazing product! Easy to use for children. Also for my older mother in law, who shouldn't strain herself. These wipes make it easy!	&&&
Love huggies diapers and wipes. Love that these ones have 'grip' to clean that bum!	&&&
Clorox wipes are perfect for our busy family! I have 3 month old twin girls and a 3 1/2 year old and these make clean up so easy!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes on my kitchen counters. . so convenient!	&&&
I use these wipes for everything! They're easy to use and they keep my house smelling clean and fresh	&&&
I love cleaning with these wipes! They make my house smell and feel so clean!	&&&
Best wipes on the planet...and I've tried them all for my sensitive skinned babies! Plus they work well and aren't to dry so they really clean their bums well	&&&
I carry clorox wipes in my car and in my work bag, whenever I need to disinfect anything I use them.	&&&
I love clorox wipes! They are super easy and keep my home clean and disinfected.	&&&
After reading the reviews on these Kimtech Science DELICATE Task Wipes I had no option but to feel as I had to speak up for this product. Kimtech brand is all we purchase. I've used them in my place of employment for years. The company builds electronic based equipment and various other items related to the industry. The company purchases these for a multitude of uses and they are made available to everyone to use. We have many employees who are required to wear safety glasses who use them to keep them clean, we clean some items with alcohol based cleaner and they stay strong, as well as several types of displays from pc monitors to cell phones and they hold up well for the job that they are intended for. I feel the two ratings for 1 star was because someone felt they were wipes similar to paper towels since they are listed in with paper products and they are a good value for the qty you purchase. I hope this helps someone understand that it's not a paper towel product. It's a delicate wipe similar to something they would clean eyes glasses with. Thanks."}},	&&&
I used this item several time already and it helps to keep the actual mask on your face more snug and in place. I would not use clorox wipes, because the my mask can't have harsh chemicals used on it. Since using these my mask stays in place more and does not move around as much at night. I will buy these again as needed.	&&&
Gave to my niece as a shower gift for her first child. Best idea ever! Wish these were around years ago when I was changing diapers on little ones! Also, goes well with the diaper organizer for a more complete gift idea. I like that this item also helps prevent bacteria growth in the wipes. This is a really great item!	&&&
These wipes are great and easy to use perfect for cloth diapering and wiping dirty hands after feedings. I would purchase these again.	&&&
Title says it all. These wipes are perfect ! Love how thick and moist they are !	&&&
Wipes are something I'm in and out of 8-10 times a day and this dispenser makes it easy. It's solid and sturdy. Easy to load wipes into and they never dry out. A must have for our changing table.	&&&
Target has these wipes at a good price and they are helpful for me while I am pumping at work. It is difficult to completely clean the Madela pump parts with the wipes alone, there are parts that you just cant get to. I like to clean as much as I can with the wipes and then rinse with water. I pump three times a day at work	&&&
These stunk something fierce. One package was more than enough to convince me not to buy these again. Luckily I've got no babies running around anymore.	&&&
Definitely worth the money. They are absorbent, edges don't unravel, and they are soft, even if you hang dry them.	&&&
I had no problem w/ Kirkland baby wipes until approximately 3 years ago. Either something changed in the product manufacture or there is a latex derivative in the packaging, or manufacturing that was not used in earlier years. My allergy is a gradual and near intolerable itch with continued use. Thus far, only Pampers baby wipes have not caused a skin reaction.	&&&
"The wet wipes are the same as they always have been, but the -new- plastic container, NO.

When I placed the wet wipes inside, I didn't have an issue, but when I checked on it (day 4) because I purchased it for my husband, I cut my right side of my thumb so drastically, that I needed stitches. It was just like I took a razor blade and ran it deeply and evenly - It slashed it from the lid that you use to open it to refill.

I could not get my thumb to stop bleeding for almost two hours. My husband wanted me to go to the emergency room to get stitches, but I had painting to do (I was just about to start when this happened) ...needless to say, I didn't get to my painting for a few hours because of it. I finally got it to stop bleeding over the day, but the next day, I wish I had went and got stitches. Two days later and it's still hurting.

I was very upset about this obviously, because Kleenex/Cottonelle isn't a company that I've noticed before, to not notice something like this. I hope this hasn't happened, nor will happen, to anyone else.

As for the company, I don't blame them fully, I blame the container they've chosen to hold their product - hopefully they didn't make it.

If you purchased this, just be extra careful with the lid :)"	&&&
I used this product for my sons diaper wipes to carry.when I am out and about with family or to run errands this Mickey Mouse wipe case is great because it.sturdy and locks tight with out any leaks it's the best I've ever used and it's better then huggies,pampers diaper wipes travel case.	&&&
Using regular tissues or other methods to wipe a kids nose will make them red so fast because their skin is so sensitive. These help, though our kid still hates getting her nose wiped.	&&&
I am obsessed with these wipes. They are so think and durible and last longer then any other wipes I've ever used, plus they are natural and that makes a huge difference. DO NOT buy off of here though. The price is more then double what it is off of the actual honest co website. Don't lose money!	&&&
We love these wipes. They are so easy to use and great for quick spills or to disinfect counters!	&&&
The Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are so easy to use I use them on practically everything. Especially if someone in the house gets sick!	&&&
"We really like these wipes. They get the job done quickly and efficiently. The thickness is good enough to keep your hands clean but not so thick that they are hard to maneuver.

We've tried a lot of different wipes - ranging from store brands to major labels to subscription services, and these are in our top three. Huggies Simply Clean has hit the sweet spot of a quality wipe at a reasonable price."	&&&
I like Clorox disinfecting wipes, easy to take along with you. I always keep it in my car.	&&&
Love these wipes! They're easy to use, smell great and kill those germs!	&&&
Clorox Handi Wipes Heavy Duty Reusable Cloths are the best things I have found to help with all the wiping up that happens in my kitchen. I used to use regular dish cloths but the Handi Wipes make wash day much easier as I can throw them into the washer and dryer and they last for several washings. Then I just toss them. Works for me!!!	&&&
"Makeup remover wipes are so handy. I use them on the nights I am so tired that I can't even move, but still want to get the makeup off my face. I also like to keep some in my car in case I need to freshen up my makeup.

These wipes are a good size and thickness, I just wish they were a little moister (would've been 5 stars). That being said they still work pretty good at removing foundation and eye makeup. When it comes to my eyes there was no burning.

Specific Beauty provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review."	&&&
"Cons: Not very clothlike/soft. Our baby got a baby rash while using the wipes (formula is made with 99% water).
Pros: Since it is rougher it grips poop better."	&&&
I love these wipes. I think they are comparable in quality to Pampers and the sensitive have never irritated my kid's skin. They dint rip like huggies wipes.	&&&
I received this product at a discount price in exchange of my honest review I got this wipes for my wife she says that they are great she loves them	&&&
I bought these as a promo on Prime Day. Very good wipes. Sturdy and scent is not overpowering	&&&
So much better than the dispenser that comes with the cottonelle wipes! The weight makes all the difference in helping pull out the wipes one at a time and the container keeps the wipes from drying out. Wonderful product!	&&&
I purchased the Pampers Sensitive Wipes since it is scentless. I've considered buying the Huggies Natural Care Plus wipes, which is also scentless, from Costco because it's cheaper. I got a chance to try the Huggies' wipes at my sister-in-law's house before purchasing them, and I did NOT like it. The wipes are mushy that they break easily being pulled from the wipes warmer. Though Huggies' wipes are thicker, it is also harder, and more difficult to wipe.	&&&
amazing tikness. takes less huggies wipes to clean the messiest dirty diaper than pampers. thanks for great products huggies	&&&
They are cheaper than Johnson and Johnson face wipes but these wipes are smaller in size.	&&&
Great product when you have children. Easily wipes up messes.	&&&
This has always been my go to. Use it in my laundry and I always have the TO GO wipes in my purse.	&&&
Love my wipes! Keep them handy everywhere, even the popup for quick cleanups!	&&&
I love everything made by Huggies, I prefer their brand wipes because they are thicker and beter quality than other brands. You don't have to use 50 wipes for a messy job because they're thick enough to fold over and clean more.	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes and keep them in every room of the house and around my office at work.	&&&
The wipes are easy to use and give you peace of mind knowing your family has some protection from germs.	&&&
These wipes are SO much better than Cottonelle, and I love that I am using something natural in my nether regions.	&&&
Wipe canisters are so easy to use. Wipes do not dry out even the very last one in the canister. Great for school. The only brand I give to my kids' classroom.	&&&
We love the wipes. The are easy to use and a good price.	&&&
Clorox is a household staple and so easy to use their wipes for a quick cleanup wherever and whenever necessary.	&&&
I totally depend on clorox wipes for a fast easy cleanup of my messy kitchen. Love them!	&&&
We use clorox disinfecting wipes for everything. The hold up and clean very well!	&&&
I love these all natural wipes. They work really well and have only two ingredients, both completely natural! The package says not for use in any other wipe container, but I go through a pack so fast that I have no issues with them drying out in the wipe warmer.	&&&
These are much more mild than any of the other "natural" or "hypoallergenic" or any of the other wipes. love em.	&&&
Does the job and does it well. Don't leave home without them! Easy to carry, easy to use and easy to dispose of. For those that understand no further explanation is necessary.	&&&
I love the idea of these, and bought them because of the excellent reviews. I used them a few times and liked them, but my cat began to recognize the container, and when I got it out to give her a little cleaning, she would run away. They do have an odd odor - not really bad, but distinct, and not pleasant that I guess she hated. I gave them to my local animal shelter.	&&&
Great price for a great product. Haven't been let down yet, I've purchased these on Amazon many of times and will continue to until my son is fully Potty trained.	&&&
I bought these along with 124 count Huggies slip-ons. I couldn't believe the price. These work so much better than any brand and type I've tried before!	&&&
I have ordered this item several time. The new mothers just love them. I'll probable order more down the road	&&&
My newborn has very sensitive skin and these wipes are gentle but still get the job done! Excellent value as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\r\rI LOVE these wipes. They are durable, moist, and I feel good using these on my children.	&&&
Nail polish remover made quick and easy. Only advice: use in well ventilated area as has strong odor.	&&&
I love pampers. These pampers wipes are great for my son. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love the pampers wipes, they are soft and get the job done. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.	&&&
excellent product. great price. have one for ea bathroom	&&&
"Just got a Google cardboard headset and these lights will be perfect for cleaning my phone screen in order to be able to view my phone in virtual reality. It cleaned my screen while and made my viewing experience crystal clear.

I received this item at a deep discount or for free in order to give my honest unbiased opinion."	&&&
Love the ease and usefulness of these cloths. The rose has an especially nice, delicate smell!	&&&
So I love using these when my son has a diaper rash but the only thing I don't like is the scent it has. I know it's suppose to be scent less but it has some type of smell that is left over every time that I'm not fond of. But I would definitely recommend for sensitive skin/bottoms [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Great for when pumping on the go!	&&&
"Thanks these are just what we needed
Great price for the number we got.
Pampers makes great products have never had a bad experience"	&&&
I wish these were larger in size. We ended up using them as washcloths in his tub. If they were larger you could really put them to good use.	&&&
I like this product, the only reason I gave it a 4 is because sometimes it is a little too wet.	&&&
These are the best wipes ever, they are strong, smells good and gets the job done with 3 maximum.I have used several brands including others from Huggies.	&&&
If your a mom you need this in your life! Say goodbye to dry chappy little noses. I was skeptical about these with my first child. Now I'm a mommy of three there a must have! These are so much better on there dry sore runny noses, plus it cleans the boogies up in one wipe. If your still on the fence about these check out babies r us they usually have the sample wipes for sale."	&&&
I love these! I was using a Skip Hop changer with a hard plastic wipes holder, but the wipes kept getting colored by the plastic and it was just big. I would up having to get my own diaper bag because my husband kept messing with the system I had on our shared diaper backpack (a Fisher Price which was okay, and came with its own hard plastic wipes case which didn't seem to close well so the wipes kept drying out) so I bough a Ju Ju Be BFF diaper bag (an awesome bag, worth the price). The BFF is a bit small, so I needed to pare down my items. I didn't want to use a hard wipes case because of the size, so I decided to try these out. I wish I had these from when my son was born. They are shorter than a hard wipes case, but still fit regular size wipes (I use the Pampers sensitive wipes). So far it has kept the wipes moist, and that's after two weeks in my diaper bag. I'm able to easily unzip it with one hand while changing my son, and the flexibility of these means they don't take up much space in my diaper bag but still fit a good bunch of wipes. I think I put in about ten wipes, maybe more, I've never counted them because I just grab a bunch. On Etsy I found a seller who makes covers for these with the materials from the Ju Ju Be bags, so I was able to get a cover that matched my diaper bag. I only use one, so I have the second one as a spare. I have to say these are the best wipes holders on the market now!	&&&
The Pamper Sensitive wipes are the best. They are thick enough to clean anything and the correct size. These are better than the regular Pampers wipes which I find to be too thin and unhelpful. I'm not a fan of the Huggies smell.	&&&
"It smelled good and I like that it is chlorine-free.
However, I always waste the tissues whenever I use it for my baby's diaper change.
I am holding my baby with one hand and take the tissue out from the package with the other hand.
All tissues stuck together and it is hard to separate them, so ended up, I have to use two or three sheets of wet tissue to wipe as it is so difficult to separate the sheets."	&&&
My dogs actually stand still and seem to enjoy being "wiped" down. They smell good afterwards and I am amazed at how much dirt comes off their coats.	&&&
I will never buy these again. Very thin. It's a great deal for what you get, however seems like you have to use double compared to competitor.	&&&
A friend was able to purchase this for me using her account, and bout the wipes i just run out of these wipes and i need some for the house, i have already used this wipes and they are just work well with my baby. great necessary wipes to have.	&&&
Love this nail polish remover wipes it really does the job and the price is great	&&&
Great wipes came on time and my cousins is very happy to have them for her new bundle of joy.  	&&&
My son has really sensitive skin and these are so soft and gentle. Plus no real perfume smell. I absolutely love them.	&&&
"I am hooked on these new amazon baby wipes. They are strong, moist and there are a lot in the package. We use a hybrid of cloth diapers and disposable. These wipes get caught in the wash sometimes and when they come out- they are thick and still great quality. I sometimes throw the washed ""disposable"" wipe in with our cloth wipes and get a second use out of them.
Pampers are moist but are small and thin. Huggies are thick but are often dry. BJ's wholesale club are the only store that has wipes that are comparable but I don't have a BJ's near me.

The cover snaps shut well and keeps the wipes wet.
Amazon, you have sold me on these. They are great! I will be ordering more!

The tub was a nice bonus- but not necessary. We just used them right out of the package and taped it back shut again before the next use. I guess if you don't go through wipes quickly, the tub is helpful."	&&&
These wipes are great for tiny hineys, but are a bit thin for a larger toddler hiney and sticky poos.	&&&
These are my preferred wipes. I've used all brands and decided to only buy these from now on. They simply wipe better. Decent price with subscribe & save.	&&&
THESE ARE THE BEST WIPES FOR THE MONEY. IM AN ADULT AND USE THEM TO BE FRESH AND CLEAN.THANKS WALMART TRY THEM YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.	&&&
The natural wipes are better for really sensitive skin I did use the sensitive wipes but wen my son got a diaper rash I changed the wipes to natural and he seemed to like these better than the sensitive ones.	&&&
The wipes does a good job of removing makeup and leaves my skin clean and not oily.	&&&
These used to be really great wipes, but recently they changed the product and packaging...both very much for the worse. The new ones smell bad...I can deal with that. Most of the time there are other worse smells in the room if you know what I mean. But some chemical they added is irritating to the skin for most people...especially soft baby skin. And the new packaging easily rips and dries out the wipes. Changing a diaper can be enough of a challenge sometimes, I don't need to be worrying about if I am going to rip apart the wipes packaging when grabbing a wipe one handed. Boo!	&&&
I switched to these from Pampers Sensitive last month and am not looking back. These are great. The wipes themselves are a little thinner than the Pampers, but I haven't had any problems with them. They seem to be more gentle since they don't have alcohol in them - there's been a lot less crying during diaper changes with these wipes. And I love that for the price of the Pampers wipes I can get these which have simpler ingredients in them.	&&&
My son has never ha problems when using these wipes, he got a diaper rash after using the pampers wipes after that I've switched to huggies and been a huggies fan ever since !	&&&
A big issue that we have always found with any wipe (especially sensitive wipes) is that they are either too wet or too dry, too thick or too thin, or they aren't packaged well. These are perfect. The texture of the wipe is perfect, the moisture is perfect, these do not bother my baby's skin at all, and the package reseals again and again without issue. I highly recommend for babies with allergy-induced eczema like our daughter has.	&&&
I've used tons of removers and makeup wipes and even after washing my face I always had eye makeup residue. I was skeptical about these wipes but after I've used them I can truly say they are magic in a wipe. They really work! Don't let their small size fool you - they're pretty powerful and REALLY get the gunk off!	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes! I love to keep them handy for a quick clean up. These were perfcect when we went camping to clean up the camper and tables. I love them around the house to quick clean off kid tables or the kitchen counter. My only complaint is that they dry out rather quick. I wish they held a little more cleaner so it took less wipes to get the job done.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great! I use them all the time, especially in the bathroom!	&&&
I love using wipes. They are easy and stay fresh in the canister.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best. Disinfects and is easy! I just walk around the house wiping all the light switches and door knobs.	&&&
"Being the grandmother of 4 boys under the age of 5 calls for a lot clean ups. Clorox Wipes are my go to wipe. They clean, disinfect, and very convenient to use. I just wipe and toss!
They are the main item in my Boo-Boo Bucket!"	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes I use them everyday	&&&
I use Clorox wipes for everything. They are very convenient, easy to use and makes everything smell clean.	&&&
Some packages are a little dryer than others and the bag they come in isn't all that great but we have a wipe holder and have no problem with these. They definitely do NOT dry out the baby's skin like other wipes. We use other wipes for our own hands and cleaning up messes on the changing table.	&&&
I use these wipes in my kitchen every single day and also in my bathroom. I love the wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes makes cleaning so convenient and easy to use.	&&&
The wipes are always handy in my kitchen.I use them to clean up spills on the counter all the time. Also use them on my cutting board and in the sink. Gotta keep everything clean.	&&&
Clorox wipes (all kinds) are good for wiping down and disinfecting almost all surfaces.	&&&
Very high in price for the amount of rags you get. Very small amount in the bag. Also was the terry cloth that I was looking for. Too thin of a T shirt material.	&&&
The color bled the first time I washed it, but these are absorbent and dry fast.	&&&
Soft, easy to wring out, absorbent, and strong. I used to be able to buy these is stores locally, but now all I can find is the inferior Heavy Wipes. Love them!	&&&
As expected, on time, good price! :) What else can you say about baby wipes? Amazon, the minimum word count is silly in some cases.	&&&
These wipes are great for spills. They smell good and really disinfect. I can see the dirt on them after wiping.	&&&
I love these wipes. They have a smooth feel and don't irritate my little one at all. The price is great.	&&&
i would not recommend this product ... it still needs to be wiped off and it is shows lines ... skip this product!	&&&
I am a long time fan of Lysol products and have used Lysol disinfecting wipes with micro locks in the past. These small, sturdy wet wipes always come in handy when I need to clean in a jiffy. I have used to clean and disinfect all the possible places in my house imaginable. I have used it to disinfect my bathroom sink, kitchen sink, table tops, kitchen counter, cabinets, refrigerator, oven, microwave, doors, latches and the list goes on. It has inbuilt cleaning power which makes it very much comfortable to work with. No water or after cleaning required. One wipe is all you need, and you are all set. They are very well packed in a pop up container, easy to pull out one wipe at a time, it is not overly wet and does not leave any layer after the cleaning as well. It disinfects up to 90% of the germs. Though, now I use other wipes from Lysol, I would recommend these wipes to everyone and anyone, especially for the busy moms!	&&&
Great cleaning product. Easy to use. Never leave open or it will dry out all of them. Expensive but great. I have it on subscribe and save.	&&&
"I like these wipes. They are soft, but sturdy. I've got three little boys and we go through a ton of wipes. I usually buy the Walmart brand because they are the best value for the price, but I got these wipes because they were on super sale for ""Prime Day."" Now that I've tried them, I'd definitely say that I'd use then again, assuming the price was similar to the Walmart brand.

They are definitely a lot softer than the Walmart brand, but they are stretchy and sturdy. Haven't had a single issue."	&&&
Good wipes. Work well and clean good. I really like the thickness of them.	&&&
These wipes clean very well and are large. I did not like how thin the wipes were. I found myself using more then one when if there were thicker one would have been enough.	&&&
I like the smell of these wipes but they aren't thick enough at all. Thinner than Pampers wipes and thinner than Huggies for sure.	&&&
I have been using these wipes for about two months now and I have not had one issue. I tried huggies and it just made my baby girls butt all red and irritated. With pampers No rashes, no irritations at all.I would never use anything else but these wipes.I don't care how far I'd have to drive to get them, it is worth it.	&&&
I have always preferred Huggies wipes over any other. I love the thickness. But now to have a wipe that is thick and can clean up a "mess" with one wipe is even better. I try to be environmentally conscious when I can and these wipes are perfect for that, when you don't have to use 3 or 4 to clean up.	&&&
This is my first time trying these wipes and I have to say that I really wanted to love them. The only thing holding me back from that is when dispensing from the tub, sometimes 3 or more come out at once. Other than that, they are plenty moist and wipe messes away quite well.	&&&
The very best I have bought for my Jack Russell. They stay moist and are huge. I think he loves the smell of them, too !	&&&
I love using these wipes because they are a perfect mess maker size and have a a decent amount of cleaner to make it feel like U have exactly what u need to get ur mess under control ;-)	&&&
great product that I use regularly for disinfecting various areas of my home. It makes cleaning easier and makes everything smell clean and fresh. After I use your wipes I know that my counters, bathrooms or whatever I have cleaned is truly clean!	&&&
I use a lot of clorox products but the wipes are my favorite. they are convenient. We keep them everywhere and use them on everything.	&&&
I love the wipes. I use them religiously everywhere in the house and.	&&&
I love the convenience of these wipes. I use them for everything and they smell great!	&&&
Hate using any other wipes. These don't smell like chemicals and they are super gentle. They don't leave a soapy residue the way pampers, huggies, etc.. do. I even use these to wipe makeup off my face at the end of the day, and I don't have to wash my face with water or soap after. Not to mention they clean a babies butt better than any other "less toxic" brand of wipes I've tried, and I'm an explorer. Obsessed with these! Make the switch for your baby!	&&&
This is the second kind of Huggies wipes that I have tried and hated. Like the Natural Care, these are not soft and irritate baby's skin. I also noticed that they dried out my hands after only a few uses. I don't mind Huggies diapers, but I will stay away from their wipes.	&&&
This is nice package design and takes less space than a baby wipes. I would not flush the wipe for safe.	&&&
Excellent product, good price,quality wipes, thick and strong for the big jobs, no harmful chemicals for delicate skin, made even better by being on the Suscribe&Save program	&&&
I am seriously loving these wipes! When I ordered them online, I had expected these would be the size of a normal container with containing wipes of whatever kind...but, I was WRONG. I was shocked (happily shocked!) to see that this container is HUGE. The wipes are a good size and I have a feeling that they are going to last me quite a while! They've worked perfectly at wiping down counter tops, cleaning up after my pets, etc. Also, they have kept their moisture and I've not had to worry about them drying out! Great product that I'm happy I was able to receive in exchange for my honest review.	&&&
I alway have wipes close by they are In the car, bathroom, kitchen and i have a container in my desk at the office.	&&&
Love the cleaning wipes, not a big fan of the lemon scent	&&&
"Don't have a single negative thing to say about Pampers Sensitive wipes. They have just the right thickness and moisture to effectively do the job and avoid diaper rash.

The package we ordered came with:

1) 3 Pop-top packs which are great for travelling. These packs contain 56 wipes compared to the 64 wipes in the refills. The Pop-tops do a great job at sealing the packet and retaining wipe moisture.

2) A plastic tub which is somewhat bulky but works well at keeping the refill wipes moist.

3) 9 refill packs (64 ct) which have a sticky lid to seal them if used without a tub (I wouldn't recommend using these without a tub).

Some reviewers have complained that when trying to pull out a single wipe, several wipes come out. This does happen SOMETIMES but I really don't see why it's a big deal. If you're worried about pulling out an extra wipe then just use 2 hands to make sure that the wipes don't stick together when coming out.

Last thing worth noting is that the wipe packets come with Pamper Rewards codes on the bottom that can be used on the Pamper Rewards website. Don't expect too much in terms of 'rewards' but you might as well enter the codes if your going to be buying a lot of Pampers products."	&&&
Is a very good product, very effective, also is affordable and easy to use. I like very nuch the clorox wipes to clean the house	&&&
My baby and I loves this wipes so much. It is very soft unlike other brands that will scratch your baby's bun. Using it doesn't pretty much require you to wash your baby after diaper change.	&&&
I love the convenience of the Clorox wipes. I keep a container in the kitchen and the bathrooms and it makes for easy cleanups!	&&&
I buy and use these wipes on my 78 year old mom. My mom suffers from dementia. As often happens with dementia patients, bathing is something my mom is afraid of. You have to get creative in order to make something scary become something safe. I give my mom pedicures, which she does enjoy. These foot wipes help keep her feet cleaner, fresher smelling, and the extra attention/pampering my mom gets from her pedicure time is wonderful for both of us. I consider this product one of the elements that helps to maintain the hygiene and health of my moms feet as well as being a product that boosts her self-esteem and morale.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes - lemon scent adds that touch of freshness when cleaning my countertop in the kitchen or my desk top at my office. I am also pleased with the disinfection action these days as the flu and cold season rolls in. I have 2 young children ages 18 months and 34 months and they are constantly bringing home germs from daycare. So the doorknobs are cleaned with clorox wipes and remote controls to prevent the spread of the cold or flu. i would recommend this product to anyone, and of course the price is always right!	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes they are so easy and convenient to use	&&&
clorox wipes are a great product and convenient for quick cleanups	&&&
The wipes do a great job on cleanup and disinfecting.	&&&
I refuse to use any other brand! These wipes are tick and get the job done. I don't have to use many and the quality is great! I recommend Huggies wipes to all my friends!	&&&
I am a germaphobe and I can trust clorox disenfecting wipes to do the job. Given that I have a 19mo old, I need to rely on a product that will clean without worrying if it didn't do the job!	&&&
These wipes provide a textured surface great for gentle cleaning. They are also excellent for sensitive skin. My daughter reacts to many wipes and she doesn't have a reaction to these.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes - they do a great job disinfecting my kitchen, bathroom, dining room, den, everywhere in the house..	&&&
I'm obsessed with these guys. These wipes are good quality and they smell nice. I wash the counters then go over it with these wipes to disinfect anything left behind. They leave my sink nice and shiny and no left over marks. The towels are strong enough to scrub food off counter or stove and they don't rip, it might be a little difficult to rip. They have a good amount of wipes per bottle but since I use so many they run out fast, so I get the 3 pack.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are the best! When I use them to clean, I know that what I am cleaning will be clean and safe. I wouldn't use another wipe for my disinfecting needs!	&&&
Love these wipes! We were looking for a chlorine free wipe because our son is sensitive to rashes and these work great. Love how gentle they are too. Yes, they are pricier, but feel they are worth it to keep his skin healthier. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a chlorine wipe.	&&&
We have tried all wipes and pampers are the only ones that I don't get sick of smelling or using. Other wipes get dry fast or are too oily. We like the price and quality of pampers wipes!	&&&
"my family likes the way these wipes smell - we prefer them over the pampers sensitive baby wipes.
Great product"	&&&
We've been using Kirkland wipes for years and have recommended them to countless people. However, the new packaging is awful and makes me consider no longer purchasing the wipes and unlikely to recommend them to others. The packaging is flimsy and it rips constantly, leaving my wipes to dry out. The snap up lid now comes off the package due to either poor design or lack of adhesive or both, sometimes I can realign the adhesive but most of the time I have to put the wipes into a plastic bag to keep them wet. They also no longer dispense easily. Kirkland or the supplier cheaped out on the new packaging and this is really not up to the quality that I expect from Costco products. Very disappointing	&&&
Loved the wipes always hard to trust brands that aren't the obvious known expensive brands but I'm glad I did. These do not irritate the skin and best of all aren't too dry nor too wet. They are just right and I love the (scan to see where your wipes come from) these are just great wipes I recommend them 100%	&&&
Great wipes for a great price! These wipes are good! They don't seem to irritate my baby, they have a good thickness and are a good price for the amount you get! i think they are comparable to Huggies wipes but cheaper.	&&&
"I love the convenience of Lysol Disinfecting Wipes. I use them throughout the day in the kitchen, the bathroom, and anywhere else I feel needs sanitizing. These canisters are portable enough to take along with you in the car.

I received my order quickly in a single box. These wipes have definitely become a staple in my home."	&&&
These are the only Lens Wipes I us.	&&&
Great economy box for excellent wipes	&&&
"I will be ordering all my wipes from here from now on! I've always gotten pampers because they have the biggest and thickest wipes out there but these exceed pampers without a doubt! Not to mention cheaper!

They're super thick, they're BIG and you only need 1 or 2 wipes to clean up a mess! The little girl had a horrible diaper rash abefore using these and she had no problems with me using these on her at all! I'm not saying it helped clear it up but I can't honestly be sure!"	&&&
I much prefer them over Lysol wipes.	&&&
works good	&&&
Great wipes	&&&
"I wanted to get this because the wipes that I was buying in bulk had that horrible sticker closure and would dry out the wipes. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It keeps the moisture in and I only get 1 wipe at a time.I would definitely buy again and recommend it to others."	&&&
I really like these makeup remover wipes. The wipes come packaged in two separate packs . The wipes easily remove eye and face makeup. They have a textured surface on one side for exfoliation and the opposite side is smooth. I have very sensitive skin, but this product did not make my skin burn or get irritated. Perfect for everyday use or using when traveling. Thanks for the opportunity to receive this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.	&&&
Awesome....use 2 after a workout because I have no access to shower before work and it gets me thru the day.	&&&
This is the first time I have tried these wipes and they great. I usually buy Sam's Club Members Mark wipes. These are just as good if not better.	&&&
Yes you get 6 Clutch and Go packs, each with a 32ct refill pack. They are also assorted which is nice. I got 3 designs and 2 of each. I believe they are cheaper at Walmart individually but I had a coupon for my first subscribe and save that made this a deal. Anything that saves me from going to "Hell-Mart" is a deal in my opinion. As far as the wipes go, they are just like the ones I get from BJ's, I just wanted the packs.	&&&
Great size, great package. I like that they are unscented and they are not scratchy like some wipes. I use the wipes for so many things, not just diaper changes! They work great removing makeup, stains from clothes, cleaning my white stair banisters...love when items have multiple uses!	&&&
"I love Pampers wipes, but prefer the Huggies wipes TUBS. So I bought a single Huggies tub at the grocery store, used them, and now refill it with Pampers wipes. I find that the Huggies wipes tub has a better dispenser - it's zigzag and separates the wipes better than the Pampers ones.

I know that's a little strange to mention but maybe someone will get value from it. Thanks Pampers for the great wipes!"	&&&
"It was hard to decide if this product should get four or five stars.
I really like them. They are not expensive, and easy to grab a pack for on the go.

Inside each resealable pack are slightly moistened wipes that are very soft. If you are a parent or caregiver, they are an excellent way to wipe a nose that might have fragile, sensitive skin.
There are many disabilities that cause an overflow of mucus, these wipes are gentle and effective.

Also nice for a nose that is sore from having a bad cold. I always keep a box of Puffs around for just that reason. When skin is red and even the softest tissue (Puffs!) makes you cringe, it's these wipes to the rescue. The wipes don't leave a sticky or tacky film on the skin, they are saline based.

Now for the bad part, which actually isn't so bad.
The scent isn't just menthol. There is something else, can't identify what the smell is, and I just don't like it. Maybe plasticy? Slight chemical-ish?
While you have a cold you probably won't smell it at all, and the scent does dissipate.

Still, these are just perfect as a quick refresh."	&&&
I am a mother of five boys. My youngest is 2 weeks old. Over the years I have tried almost every baby product under the sun. Pampers is by far the best in wipes and diapers. They provide the best protection while being extremely soft and gentle on my little ones tush. Trust me, pampers is the only baby brand wipes and diapers you need.	&&&
Convenient singles. Large wipes...	&&&
Perfect for those who use air conditioning and the wipes are cold. With this heating the wipes are warm and your baby don't cry.	&&&
These are the best wipes I've ever used. I got them as a free sample in the welcome baby box and now I'm purchasing them. Much better than the Huggies wipes I had been using. They're strong and durable while getting the job done with fewer wipes.	&&&
These are the best wipes- soft, clean scent, and thick enough to clean well.	&&&
"You can use Clorox disinfects wipes anywhere and everywhere. My sisters and I travel a lot and we always take our Clorox wipes with us. We start disinfecting the door knobs , TV remote anything that we will touch. The we clean the bathroom with scented Clorox. We constantly clean and use Clorox on everything. My mother whom is 83 years old still insist on Clorox,my nieces and nephew
also love Clorox. Clorox is just part of our family!"	&&&
Use clorox wipes to clean, whiten and disinfect your everyday messes.	&&&
I love this product having two little ones running around the house means they make a mess but the wipes are very convienent	&&&
My eye doctor gave me a sample to use to clean my eyes prior to doing some testing. I liked the way it worked so well that I ended up going on-line and purchasing a box to have at home. I use them every night to remove my eye make-up and mascara and they work very, very well. I plan to continue using this product.	&&&
I love these wipes! They are my new favorite, after trying three other natural brands. No more diaper rash, perfect thickness, nice scent, and great packaging!	&&&
The wipes are quite effective. But I am not really happy with the temporary packing. I was expecting to find a wipe dispenser box along with the pack of wipes in order to ease usage and storage.	&&&
I bought this for in-between baths for my cats. It smells great and gives their coat a nice texture. It is safe and my kittys didn't mind it at all. Also great for my tom cat who lives outside and a regular bath is NOT an option for him. Great price and was shipped super fast. I LOVE this brand and will buy again and again!!	&&&
Had always used Cottonelle wipes but thought I would try these to compare. Well, as far as I'm concerned, there is no comparison. This brand, in my opinion, is much better than Cottonelle. Each sheet is larger, softer & easier to grasp than the other brand, so my young grandson can take care of his bathroom needs without much help by using them. Having read on line that flushing any type of cleansing wipe is not advisable due to possible plumbing issues, I don't flush them. I'm not a specific brand shopper, I use what works best for me & my family and this is the brand I plan to use now. Very pleased with the product.	&&&
Having 2 babies at once, I am always looking for the best quality and least expensive type of wipe available. Huggies natural care, out of the dozens I have tried, works best for my kids. The wipes are sturdy, hold up during wiping, fairly thick, non perfumed and have never irritated their skin (the kids have sensitive skin). I can use them to wipe my hands clean without feeling any residue. They come out of the pack easily as well, and when you want just one wipe, it releases easily without bringing several wipes along with it. This size package (32 ct) is perfect for the portable baby changer mesh pocket. I am not necessarily brand conscious, but after trying even the generics, this one by far is my favorite wipe.	&&&
Works like it should	&&&
Thank you so much!!!! I love it.... smell really good!!!!	&&&
I'd been looking for new cloths for a long time, but hard a hard time finding colors and sizes that fit my needs. These do both and work well. I'l be buying more in other colors for other uses.	&&&
These wipes are perfect to throw into the breast pump bag and clean everything between uses. Small packaging allows you to take only what you need.	&&&
I've been ordering these for a very long time and they are the best. I've used these since my daughter was born (2 years old now) and now with my 7 month old baby. They are not too wet and very soft. I've found that Pampers tend to be very wet and they leave the skin too moist.	&&&
My FAVORITE wipes of all time! I love that it only takes 1 or 2 wipes to clean a big mess. They also smell so freaking great!	&&&
Great product, wipes are always perfect and it's very practical. love it!	&&&
"This is an effective way to quickly reduce the extent to which your colleagues, roommates, carpoolers, etc., will mock you endlessly if your work-out happens to end right around the time that you have to hang out with other humans.

For example, if you work-out right before going to work such as over a lunch hour, or if you bike or run to work, you can keep these in your gym bag or desk and quickly towel off before returning to work. The wipes are fairly big and are enough to get one good wipe off of most of your torso, arms, and legs. It's not a deep clean, of course, but that's a little much to ask from a bag.

Overall, I recommend this to others."	&&&
Only wipes that my daughter's skin can tolerate. If you have a baby with sensitive skin, this is the way to go!	&&&
Shout wipes are convenient enough to put in my purse. It has saved me from a mustard mess on my shirt. This is a must-have.	&&&
I am a huge fan of these wipes. I was given some samples to try and fell in love. We don't use anything else anymore. They have a great consistency and a perfect blend of thickness and moistness. I am also loving the free and clear aspect of them. It makes me feel great when I know I am using the best for my daughter. I would highly recommend these to everyone I know. If y9u haven't tried these wipes you need to soon trust me you won't be disappointed!	&&&
Through 3 kids me and the wife have tried plenty of wipes and always go back to huggies. Natural care is our favorite because of how soft they are and do the job. There are cheaper wipes out there but nothing compares to the quality of huggies.	&&&
These facial wipes are generous size and adequately moistened to remove your heaviest makeup and even waterproof mascara at the end of the day. They leave the skin feeling moistened and soft. And to boot the price is right!	&&&
Got this for my daughter. She says it works very well. Each pack comes with 30 wipes which is not stated. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.	&&&
I love these wipes! You may pay a little more than generic but they aren't kidding when they say one and done. They are nice and thick and gentle on baby's bottom or face or hands. We have these strewn through the house and van because we use them for everything! And with 3 little ones things get sloppy :)	&&&
My baby use to cry when we would wipe her with room temperature wipes but she does not cry when being wiped with warm wipes. The temperature of the wipes is perfect! My only complaint about wipe warmers in general is the units are a little bulky. We and the baby are very happy with the wipe warmer!	&&&
Best wipes I've used... not too dry, not too wet, and not made with all the chemicals that other wipes are made with	&&&
I love all Clorox products, especially the wipes I have 4 little ones and its very convenient	&&&
I love Clorox wipes - they are so easy to use and they work so well!	&&&
These wipes make me more at ease in the kitchen with easy cleanup of messes and knowing that the areas I have cleaned are also disinfected. Love the smell too!	&&&
With active teens in my home, Clorox is a life saver. The toilet products keep the bathroom smelling fresh. The disinfecting wipes make it easy to clean up messes. And the bleach keeps the stains from ruining their clothes. I love Clorox!	&&&
For as long as I can remember there has alwyas been a form of Clorox in the kitchen. The wipes are one of our family's favorite products.	&&&
i love the clorox wipes it works wonders when im on the go!!	&&&
I've always use clorox wipes to disinfect my home and classroom. They work really well!	&&&
I enjoy using these wipes in the kitchen and bathroom for cleaning surfaces!	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes to disinfect everything in my house!	&&&
Clorox wipes makes cleaning and disinfecting super easy with their wipes. Just one step instead of having to get paper towel plus cleaners.	&&&
I am an UBER MAC fan. I love most things that MAC makes, but I am not crazy about these wipes. The scent is really different...herbally but fresh. The wipes work ok. They do the job but no differently or better than any other wipe. The worst part is that the top does not seal well, and when I try to pull one wipe out I almost always get two. For the $$, this shouldnt be happening, particularly with the top not staying closed. I wont be repurchasing.	&&&
The wipes are easy and quick. What's easiest is pulling out the individual wipes. They tear easily and you don't end up pulling out more than you need.	&&&
we love clorox disinfecting wipes! great for families with young kids	&&&
These wipes are so incredibly thin. They rip very easily and fall to pieces. It's like drying to use a wet tissue! Won't buy again. The pampers wipes are so much better!	&&&
I use these wipes in my kitchen and bathroom. They're great!	&&&
Pampers make the best wipes. They are moist to get the job done using less. I've tried saving money with other brands but you just end up using more wipes! These are gentle enough on baby's skin with no irritation.	&&&
"This is definitely a useful product but not 100% perfect. We bought 2- one for upstairs and downstairs changing stations. The containers keep the wipes moist. Most of the time only 1 wipe comes out but sometimes more than 1 does."	&&&
It takes me 2 wipes just to clean eye makeup off. Not enough product on the wipes. Takes a lot of rubbing to remove mascara. So I'd say it was a good idea but doesn't work well enough to be worth the price. 20 wipes for $18. That's only 10 days of use. I know it's pre cleanse and you still have to use you cleanser after this pre cleanse, but it doesn't pre cleanse enough to be worth it.	&&&
It gets the jewelry sparkling clean to a brand new finish. Worth the money! I like this product very much!	&&&
My vehicles really get dirty, and I mean really dirty, in no time at all. Between dusty hay fields, drifting dust from riding arenas, all the dirt and sawdust I drag in with me, and just general dust, they are in a constant state of needing cleaned. This used to be an all day chore, but thanks to Armor All Cleaning Wipes, my vehicles stay (somewhat) clean all the time, and I do not have to take time out of my day to do it.	&&&
The product works and that's what counts	&&&
good for the price	&&&
"Would be good if the sheets came out of the container correctly. They keep ripping and I have to open the container and take out the thorn sheet then rethread the next sheet only to have it do the same thing."	&&&
These wipes are amazing for out little girl with her sensitive skin!	&&&
Prefer over competition.	&&&
Loved for many years, until I tried amazons wipes which are better. These are the best wipes from pampers brand besides the sensitive.	&&&
The wipes are great but I was upset when they arrived from Amazon. The two canisters were wrapped in shrink-wrap but somehow the lids opened. The cleaning solutions dripped all over the canisters, the labels were soggy and fell off, and my other products smelled like Lysol. I bought these to send with my kids to school, and I will still send them. But they are now without labels and the wipes might be a little dried out.	&&&
These wipes are horrible. The first time I used them on my son he broke out in horrible blisters. He's two and has never had an issue with being sensitive to wipes, so this is very unusual. I definitely don't recommend them.	&&&
I found these to be excellent removing my eye make-up. Non-greasy and totally effective in my opinion.	&&&
These wipes were a fantastic deal. They are thick enough and decent quality especially for the price. They are unscented and gentle enough for my daughters sensitive skin.	&&&
Enjoyed my free sample that I received for purpose of my review. First off cute little design on the wipes- not that this is personally an important factor for me but sometimes just seeing they take that little bit of extra time shows that they are thinking more about the customer.Secondly this wipes are strong but gentle! I've tried multiple different wipes wanting this feature but you'll get normally one side of the spectrum; either gentle wipes so not made strong enough and can rip easily or a strong wipe that feels rough on my baby's skin. Definitely loved the product test and will be switching!	&&&
I got a package of these to try at a very good price between a coupon and the Black Friday in June deal. The texture is good, they are a little larger than Pampers swaddlers wipes, but the only thing I don't like is that they don't pull apart quite as easily so when they're in the wipes box and you go to pull one or two out you get a long giant strip and you have to shove them back in. They have a texture which Pampers swaddlers do not and I'm not sure if I like it or not. Overall if they were significantly cheaper I might buy them over the swaddlers but did not dislike them by any means	&&&
I got these to use as face and hand wipes and they work great. It's nice to use something that isn't full of chemicals, dyes and perfumes.	&&&
These wipes stay wet the entire time I am cleaning my face and easily remove my makeup with no scrubbing. This is great for eye makeup and mascara! The wipes clean it right off with little effort and no irritation! One wipe is all I need to remove my makeup and leave my face, neck and decolletage feeling clean and smooth! I LOVE that these wipes are made with Micellar water- in fact the first ingredient listed is actually water! The package boasts the wipes contain NO artificial perfume or dyes which explains why I don't feel like I have to rinse my face with water after using these. They leave no residue behind just a clean and refreshed feeling with soft skin!	&&&
I received a free sample of these Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes and I loved them!I like that they are truly safe to use on my daughter and of good quality!	&&&
Love these wipes! We used to use Huggies Natural and they worked well. But this is a perfect alternative. The wipes are a good thickness and do not leave your hands feeling slimy like the Pampers Sensitive Wipes. I do wish they were a little more narrow to fit in the wipes container a little better, but overall, these are our go-to wipes from now on!	&&&
Wipes are fine but the container they come in is not. Plastic pop open piece comes off very easily leaving them useless because all the wipes dry up.	&&&
Amazon Elements Baby wipes met all the requirements that I was looking for. Some wipes are small in size and tear easily, not this brand. One wipe does the job. Only con would be the container. The push button to release the lid broke after 3 days when husband went to use it. I will have to find another container.	&&&
I use no other wipes then these for my baby girl. I had used other brands on my other children and I see the difference it makes on her skin. She hasn't had any reactions. And may I add how soft they are, a must on a baby's skin. Great product!	&&&
I been using huggies wipes for years just for myself, for makeup removal and to clean my hands where no soap and water was available. But now I have a 7 months old little girl and I can confirm this are the best wipes ever! they clean everything from diaper changes to high chair food mess. I 'm recommending this product to everybody, especially first time moms like me. Nothing bad to write about this product, excellent!!	&&&
Of all the Huggies style of wipes these have got to be my favorite! The wipes live up to their job! They're best to use on soiled diapers. They're a little more moist than Huggies other wipes but still gentle.	&&&
the wipes are so easy to use, are durable, and leave a nice scent	&&&
My wife an i use nothing else but clorox wipes. We love the cleaning power and the way the disinfect everything	&&&
I love using these wipes to quickly clean counters and doorknobs!	&&&
These baby wipes are wonderful. They have no perfume to upset my nose or cause breakout on the baby or anyone else. We got our first big package of these last December. The following month our water was polluted by a chemical and we couldn't use our water for drinking, bathing, or anything but flushing toilets. We used these baby wipes for everything from cleaning our hands to washing our bodies if we hadn't managed to get enough water from the bulk water distribution to take a pot bath. I even used them to wash out my kid's sippy cup and then rinsed it out with bottled water. We love these wipes. They do the trick and are thick enough to stand up to the job but are soft enough for any sensitive part of the body.	&&&
Use these at every mealtime to wipe little fingers and face. The "Boogie Wipes" as pure saline and gentler for the face especially with teething rash cheeks, but these are a must for sticky little hands!	&&&
Been using these wipes for years. My skin has never had a sensitive reaction and the price is right.	&&&
I haven't used them much as I just received them - seem to work well though. The wipes are not wringing wet like another popular brand that I used to purchase.	&&&
Great product to use around that time of the month to stay nice and clean and fresh. I always carry a few with me in my purse when I'm on the go.	&&&
The upright dispenser works well. We have a septic tank so it was very important that the wipes were okay to use; they are. We get the Cottondale Wipes through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. Good product.	&&&
My daughter has sensitive skin. Other brands have often caused rashes, but these wipes have consistently worked well for more than a year. Just be sure to close the package as they will dry out quickly if exposed to air.	&&&
As advertised.	&&&
I work in a preschool and I trust nothing else but Clorox wipes to kill germs fast!	&&&
These wipes are wonderful. My kids always seem to be making some sort of mess in the bathroom and the wipes make it easy to clean up. I also love that they disinfect the surfaces to keep everyone healthy.	&&&
"I feel comfortable knowing I have a product in my household that works and makes me feel confident that germs and what not are being killed off. With a husband who gets a little OCD about germs it helps to have wipes like these around.

These Softy wipes smell really good and aren't overpowering and stinky like most other wipes of it's kind. I like that they include aloe and Vitamin E to keep my hands soft and not sticky when I use them. Also love that they can be used on the body.

I love using them to wipe off my counters after making a meal and dealing with raw meat of any sort or even raw eggs. No one wants to work with a dirty counter or set stuff on it and risk germs getting on stuff.

These wipes are extra large in size to make it easier to clean up any sort of mess and not have to keep grabbing more. As a mom of a toddler, this is a big must have. She likes to get into dirt or when she sneezes, she may not cover her mouth. Same goes with coughing.

They are also very soft hence why they are called Softy. No need to worry about rough wipes here folks! Great product and a big MUST HAVE for parents."	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They are great to clean up messes from kids and they are quick and easy. They are also great for quick cleaning before company comes over.	&&&
I like how easy to use the Clorox Lemon wipes are and they leave a nice, fresh scent when I am finished. I keep these in all the bathrooms at my house.	&&&
Clorox is the only cleaner I use ! Clorox spray with bleach for the tough stains...Clorox anywhere spray BUT MY FAVORITE is the lemon disinfecting wipes. Durable wipes and cleans great. It doesn't just move dirt around If you want proof the next time you use them take a look at the wipe after using it on just a small area. It will show you how ineffective your previous cleaner really was !!!!!	&&&
We love these wipes because they are so convenient.	&&&
I highly recommend these flushable wipes to anyone that travels a lot. I travel almost 200 days a year & I ensure these items are in my suitcase. These individually wrapped wipes are small enough to fit conveniently in one's pocket or purse.	&&&
These wipes are very convenient to use. It is easy to use, does the job well, and is also affordable.	&&&
I love the lemon wipes . I have a messy toddler and they work great!!!	&&&
Im always cleaning and clorox wipes are my best friends. Love the simplicity a effectiveness of this product.	&&&
Love the convenience of Clorox wipes and all the many surfaces that we can use them on in my kitchen, bathroom and even outdoors. We always bring some along when we go camping because they are so convenient we can use them in place of bringing along multiple cleaning products.	&&&
Love to use Clorox Wipes with a toddler in the house!	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes. Great to bring to work to clean your desk and cubicle from those nasty germs!	&&&
Love the ease and convenience of the clorox wipes!!	&&&
Love these wipes! Use these to wipe down the counters every night.	&&&
baby wipes are the bomb. I mean you need them, and these work well. Just HATE how a new container is included in every shipment, I feel a little robbed, but this package works well.	&&&
Love clorox disinfecting wipes. I trust them to always get the job done.	&&&
I have used Clorox wipes for a while. They are so convenient to clean up quick messes everywhere.	&&&
The wipes are magic no matter the stain it is easy and convenient to pop a wipe out and handle it.	&&&
The disinfecting wipes are great except for orange fusion. The smell is nothing like orange. It smells of chemicals and stays on your hands long after use and many hand washings. Other than that I have no complaints about the product. My complaint is about the dispenser that is so frustrating to use. It doesn't hold the wipe securely, they fall into the container, the top must be removed to get one, then top replaced. And the lower the quantity of wipes gets the dispenser will not hold them at all. Again the top must be removed to dig one out, then it must be squeezed out so whatever is being cleaned isn't drenched with the cleaning liquid because they are SOAKED then the top replaced again. Surely Clorox can come up with something better.	&&&
Five stars for Clorox. I need it for everything. when i go to may country, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes is in my bag.	&&&
I was really looking forward to trying these eye make-up remover / facial cleanser / exfoliator wipes but am very disappointed once I did. I received a twin pack so I thought I'd keep one for my every day routine and one for traveling. I do like the size and the nubs on the exfoliator side but once I opened them they were extremely dry! I read to see if I need to run them under water or use my regular eye make-up remover, but that's what I'm trying to get away from. I really wanted one product for all types of make-up. Not sure if I received a bad batch because both packs had a weird smell to them...but I'm sensitive to smells. It was a great idea but I would not recommend this product. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.	&&&
I've been ordering pampers wipes for over a year and will continue. Very good wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are essential for cleaning the drool off our walls (we have an English Mastiff :) They are super convenient for wiping counters, tables, walls, toilet, sink, and even the dash in the van. They leave everything clean and disinfected in a very short amount of time and with little effort. We couldn't do without them!	&&&
I had coffee stains-spilled a bit on me-greasy stain from cooking in the kitchen- A touch of red wine spilled on the linen dress that I was wearing. I had the wipes and used them on my dress. Then put it in the wash. Came out just fine.	&&&
For the money, these wipes are pretty good. They are actually wet, don't dry out, and seem to hold up during a major poopsplosion without having to fold them up. The only downer is that they can be hard to get out of the container---pull one, get ten. I notice this with a lot of wipe brands so I don't think it is that big of an issue, but an opting nonetheless. That being said, they are cheap...and shipped to my door every month and I don't even have to think about it. Love.	&&&
A family member recommended these to me. I have tried about 4 of them, and none of them have cleaned my glasses fully. The one time they cleaned a little bit of my glasses, I had to press pretty hard, and it's not good to press hard on your lenses. They do not feel like they have much solution on them. I now have almost a full box these wipes that will probably just end up in the garbage.	&&&
I use these wipes from time to time in my diaper bag. I tend to buy whatever catches my eye and/or is on sale. I always go with Huggies because they are thick without being too thick. They aren't my absolute favourite wipe (I prefer naturals or one and done) but they're good nonetheless.	&&&
Charmin wipes are the best on the market. Since the grocery stores don't always have the product we purchase from Sam's Club on line.	&&&
The wipes seem good and nice not to have a chemical smell. But as some other reviewers noted, the dispenser is poorly designed and so far I have to remove the top to get a new wipe --- can't just pull and have the next one waiting. That will probably prevent me from re-ordering this brand.	&&&
I think I have tried all of the wipes brands and huggies breaks apart from the other wipes the easiest when you need it the most!	&&&
I wear double glitter on my nails (two different brands) with smaller glitter and then larger glitter. Taking it off is an ordeal and a lot of use of liquid nail polish remover and cotton balls. So, I thought I'd try these. WOW! Just 1 wipe cleaned all 10 of my nails. And, the textured side is great at getting rid of the glitter. The softer side is moisturizing. These also do not stink like nail polish remover normally does. There are no strong fumes. I was so impressed, I just bought more to have on hand. They also are great to take along for traveling.	&&&
Best wipes out there	&&&
I ordered these last week and then saw videos of people finding glass in their Huggies wipes. I'm not taking that chance, so I'm returning mine.	&&&
Most wipes leave my skin feeling tight. Simple's cleansing wipes have absolutely found the right ingredients to achieve the refreshing, clean and moisturizing feel I need for my face. I use these almost everyday.	&&&
Love these wipes. I keep them everywhere...kitchen, bathroom, office, car, backpack, so that I always can clean my glasses which seem to magically get smudgy several times every day.	&&&
Boogie wipes are a fabulous creation--especially for cold season. They are soft so don't roughen up baby's sensitive skin.	&&&
I love how these wipes don't irritate skin, and the material is so soft!	&&&
I absolutely think that Amazon wipes are the best. U can use one wipe to clean up a lot. They are thick, wet and well absorbing. I've used huggies, pampers, target brand. And I like these best.	&&&
I love these wipes because my son has sensitive skin and he has no skin reactions to these.	&&&
Some say baby wipes are baby wipes. I disagree. Some are thinner than others some have harsher chemicals than others. These I have to say find a right balance all around to provide me with a great wipe. My daughter is just about potty trained so we're not using them for hinies anymore but they still work great to clean little fingers and clean up spills.	&&&
Absolutely love the sent of these wipes. Ive tried others but these are tough and get the job done leaving a wonderful sent. Always my go to wipes!	&&&
Absolutely love these chemical free wipes. I also like the texture of this one, it is very gentle for baby's bottom. I took 1 star just because the wipes are not piled up perfectly in the package, I have to fish around one wipe at a time.	&&&
I have used the germ-x wipes before and they are safe to use. I wanted something safe for our toddler to use.	&&&
The best baby wipes. They are soft, gentle and great for baby face and hands too. Pampers Natural clean are my 1st choice in baby wipes.	&&&
"These are the only wipes that I use. They smell great and don't crumble or rip in your hands like other brands. My son has sensitive skin and he hasn't had a reaction with these wipes ever. Pampers all the way ! I will continue to buy this brand !
Other brands that I have tried, Parents Choice, Huggies, Up and Up. These brands never seem to smell good, Keep moist and rip very easy. I know for a fact pampers wipes have never ripped on me once, they last for a long time, They aren't dry so when wiping a babies bottom you don't have to worry about the wipe being dry and hurting them. I won't ever switch Pampers all the way !!!!"	&&&
i use these wipes to clean my baby fast and easy!!	&&&
I got a packet as a sample with a purchase of the facial wash I buy my husband. I had my doubts they would work because I've used wipes by other companies and they usually left my face clammy or smelly. Like so many nights, I was too tired to wash my face but knew I had to because I wore make up. Add dirty hands from kids touching your face and sweat and you have one disgusting face. So I decided to use the wipes. With one wipe, I cleaned all over my face and neck. My face felt clean, soft, and didn't stink. Best of all, I was in bed asleep within minutes because I didn't have to splash water in my face.	&&&
love pampers wipes. much softer than huggies. the smell is great	&&&
sanitize and disinfects the bathroom area and I love your travel package clorox wipes	&&&
"Clorox wipes - lemon.
Nice smell and easy to use. Strongly recommend."	&&&
Get Clorox clean! Tis the season for germs\u2026use Clorox wipes to make sure the whole family stays healthy.	&&&
These wipes are durable enough to wipe a baby's bottom, however be careful to not pull too hard or else it will rip. My only complaint would be that the wipes sometimes stick together which makes it a bit difficult to get out of the case. Other than that, great scent and no allergic reactions from my baby.	&&&
Great multi-use wipes. Very soft and durable. Feels a lot like real fabric. Cleaning solution doesn't drip off the cloth like most other cleaning wipes. Easy to use on counter tops, microwaves, and other kitchen and bathroom surfaces. The tub releases the cloths easily without tearing them or allowing them to fall down inside the tub. No strong odor from the cleaning solution.	&&&
I love everything about these wipes, especially the convenience they offer.	&&&
The Huggies Baby Wipes are super soft and gentle on our sons hiney. I would recommend these above all others.	&&&
I LOVE CLOROX WIPES. THEY KEEP MY BATHROOMS CLEAN AND DISINFECTED.	&&&
I love using the Clorox wipes they are convenient and easy to use.	&&&
I fell in love with these wipes! they are so thick and soft and the they have the cleanest ingredients in mainstream wipes that I have found. We started with Seventh Generation and these beat them in every area. I recommend them to EVERYONE!	&&&
it is a great help for organizing the wipes. easy to carry with when you are traveling or outside. recommended!	&&&
Love these. I was skeptical, but having trouble erasing off our wall-paint whiteboard. Problem solved. These wipes take even the toughest dry erase marker (any color) off quickly and easily. Convenient package, too.	&&&
This came so fast! And it was a such a great price too! I look forward to getting these wipes at a discount for the next few months. :)	&&&
I wasn't going to get a wipes warmer when I first found out I was pregnant, but I am glad I did. You do have to keep replacing the antibacterial cushion in there every few weeks and I found Amazon had the best deal for a pack of three. The only downside to a wipe warmer is that if you don't use the wipe right after you take it out of the warmer, the wipes get cold pretty quickly. As the boys got older, they wiggled a lot more during changing so sometimes we had to wait a few moments to get them back on center after we had already pulled the wipes out. Every change started with a cold wipe after the boys were about 8 months old. We unplugged it and just use it as a wipe holder.	&&&
These are my favorite clothe wipes. I have ordered them several times. Hold up very well too after many washes.	&&&
I've been buying this for three years and use them constantly. They have the right amount of moisture and I love the smell.	&&&
So far my baby has not expressed any concern over the use of these baby wipes. That' probably due more to the fact that he can't talk yet.	&&&
I use this wipe warmer in my little ones nursery. While this wipe warmer adds a great pop of color and blends well with her bed room decor...it has been a source of disappointment... The latch that keeps the top down doesn't work properly and because of this the tops wipes are always dry, which unfortunately is a waste.... I have the old prince lionheart wipe warmer (the all white one) that I kept from when my oldest girl was an infant and it has worked fine.	&&&
"These wipes are great for cleaning breast pump accessories on the go (that's what I mainly use them for). They clean well and don't leave a smell or residue behind."	&&&
Our son has extremely sensitive skin & breaks out in a rash if regular wipes touch anything but his bottom. Having used other products brands we decided to give them a shot and were very happy when no rash appeared. We can even use these on his face with no issue. The wipes don't have a scent & are nice size, thick & soft. A must have for the diaper & around the house. Plus cheaper & better size then Boogie wipes	&&&
This product made it even worse when I tried to wipe his nose, my three year old hated these. They may work for others, as I bought it because of it's rating. Maybe a different age would respond better?	&&&
We definitely will be buying these wipes again. I just wish our first box was delivered to us so we didn't have to wait an extra 3 days for our replacement. But so far we really like them, they don't burn my face like huggies and pampers did. They're a little thin but very good. And they did great with the dirty diapers. These will be our wipes till this little guy is out of diapers.	&&&
I received a sample from seventh generation to try and I am so pleased. The wipes are very thick and durable and work great. My child has sensitive skin and it didn't affect them at all. This is my new go to wipes.	&&&
I tried the competitors wipes first, and ended up giving them ALL away and buying Huggies wipes instead after receiving a sample in the mail. They were FAR more moist than others I'd tried, yet not dripping wet. They're strong enough to keep my hands free of mess during changes, but soft and moist enough to handle my lactose free formula fed baby's tough messes (which is really saying something!). I would, and have, recommended them to others, and will continue to do so!	&&&
I have been using these wipes for seven months now and they're the only wipes I've continued to purchase. I love the fresh scent, softness and how well they clean without drying out baby's skin.	&&&
"My sister in law introduced me to these wipes. She works as a surgery nurse and says this is what the surgeons use. When I found out I could get these wipes off of Amazon I jumped at the chance.

I'm not a big fan of the cloth wipes or the spray, the spray is too bulky to carry in a pocket and without it I never feel the cloth wipes get my glasses truly clean. But these lens wipes are nice and small and easy to carry!

I keep the box next to my keys and wallet and every morning I put two or three in my pocket so that I can use them through the day. Easy!

I definitely highly recommend these wipes for people who get annoyed at the dust and dirt which can mar your vision."	&&&
Great price, great quality. Each wipes are moist and they don't have that strong chemical aroma like the clorox wipes. Great to clean tables, sticky floors, etc, etc.	&&&
I can honestly say it's better than the Honest wipes!	&&&
"These wipes have never let me down. I've been using them since my daughter was a newborn and they have never caused any problems for us. I've tried a lot of other wipes and always come back to these because they don't cause any rashes or stinging on my daughter.

I have found that they do tear and break once in a while depending on how I pull on them out of the case. This is not really a problem to me however because it doesn't happen often and the wipes themselves are nice and thick. However, these are one of the only wipes that do tear like that. Overall, very good wipes and I am satisfied. These are the only wipes I regularly repurchase."	&&&
We love these wipes they come in handy for everything from wiping her face or bottom to cleaning a little spill of her shirt.	&&&
Impressed with price and quality. Bought these for the first time on Amazon prime day for very cheap and have been using them since. Love these wipes!	&&&
I am amazed at how good these wipes are! Not only are they strong but also super soft, and no harmful chemicals for my baby. I so appreciate not having to worry about the wipe breaking in my hand and getting poop all over it! Mostly i am grateful that Seventh Generation cares about not exposing my child to harmful chemicals. I definitely recommend these baby wipes to anyone, they are so soft and natural that you can safely use them on baby's face as well. I would have liked a tin y bit of fragrance but definitely not a deal breaker. I received a free sample of this product with purpose of my honest review, opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I ordered this product every month, no need to go to my store weekly. The wipes are soft and perfect for sensitive skin if you have a kid with eczema.	&&&
The Insignia monitor wipes are fantastic. Get the job done and are reasonably priced.	&&&
These are the best wipes out there. They are thick and moist. My daughter cries when I use other brands, but she doesn't with these. They are also folded into each other and not perforated, which makes it easier to pull them out when you are in a rush and dealing with a big mess.	&&&
These are really good to keep handy in your car, purse, home, office etc... The wipes are easily accessible and smell great. I do not know how I managed to get so addicted to them but I always have them on hand.	&&&
Absolutely love the Clorox wipes. i use them for everything, from kitchen to restroom cleaning. My 4 year old loves to help wipe down her art table and play kitchen as well.	&&&
I love the convenience of Clorox Wipes and the smell is great too!	&&&
We use Clorox wipes daily, multiple times per day! Love them!	&&&
I love the smell of the disinfecting wipes! They are great!	&&&
In an effort to keep our kitchen constantly ready for holiday baking, I wipe down with one of these wipes every time I finish prepping a work station. It makes for quick and easy cleanup! I know everything is sanitized and ready for the next person and it also keeps us motivated to work on culinary creations!	&&&
I love keeping these wipes at my desk at work. There is enough cleaner in them to clean my whole desk in one wipe.	&&&
I received this with a discount for my honest and unbiased review. It got the screen fairly clean of smudges and debris. One major problem I have with it is that it leaves streak marks on whatever you apply it to. Additionally, it leaves the screen kind of tacky. Overall not that crazy about it.	&&&
I wanted one case of 7 - 100 ct. wipes. Instead, I made a mistake and ordered 7 cases! I am giving a couple of cases away to needy families. you cannot beat walmart's price. plus, it was delivered for free. One thing I suggest, though. there was an option for free shipping for orders over 50 dollars. I chose that. they said it would take about 2 weeks to be delivered. they said if I paid 2.99, it would be delivered in a few days. as soon as I saw that fedex would be delivering both shipments, I knew it would be worthless to pay the 2.99. I got the entire shipment in 2 days and didn't pay a dime for shipping. you will never beat the price plus it is delivered to your door. the only way to go.	&&&
These pads are perfect for cleaning CD, DVD or 35mm negatives. They do not scratch whether used dry or with a 98% rubbing alcohol solution. One package goes a long way for me. I buy a lot of used DVDs and it's amazing how many people put their fingerprints all over the disc. Worst thing you can do if you want to keep that disc for a long time. These pads remove the fingerprints very well, without heavy pressure. I have never bought anything but the Pec-Pad and hope they continue to stay on the market.	&&&
About 1/4 of these wipes are totally dry when opened. Terrible. Won't buy again.	&&&
Best individual hand wipes I've ever used.	&&&
Best wipes ever	&&&
I am writing this review for the 30 pack; however, once I tried them I opt for the value pack, which is twice as many. The best wipes I've found. I don't like wipes that have a scent. These don't. They are also highly effective at removing makeup. Once I use them to remove face makeup I go over my eyes to get any traces of mascara my eye makeup remover left behind. Love them! Great value, especially the value pack with a coupon.	&&&
Love these wipes! Leaves no residue on my daughter and the feel and scent is amazing!	&&&
Wipes smell very nice and are very soft. I've got the clutch and carry it in my diaper bag. The statement 'one and done' is true. My baby likes it and I like it too.	&&&
These are the best wipes. My son has very sensitive skin and these are fantastic. When i used traditional wipes on my sons bottom (with rash) he screamed. I think it had to do with the perfumes in regular wipes. These are pretty much water and so no irritating and I haven't had any melt downs while wiping with these.	&&&
I'm all about removing unnecessary chemicals in our home - especially when it comes to our kids! These are the only wipes we use!	&&&
I am amazed at how good these wipes are! Not only are they strong but also super soft, and no harmful chemicals for my baby. I so appreciate not having to worry about the wipe breaking in my hand and getting poop all over it! Mostly i am grateful that Seventh Generation cares about not exposing my child to harmful chemicals. I definitely recommend these baby wipes to anyone, they are so soft and natural that you can safely use them on baby's face as well. I would have liked a tiny bit of fragrance but definitely not a deal breaker.I received a free sample of this product with purpose of my honest review, opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
The only wipes I use. Much better than the soft and gentle.	&&&
Love the Clorox brand products. The wipes are especially handy in either the canister or the bag. Easy to carry in our vehicle for fast disinfection of carts.	&&&
I use clorox disinfect wipes religiouly in my household. easy to use, my son enjoys using them to clean.	&&&
I really enjoy these wipes and so do my kiddos! When the kids are doing chores it makes their life so much easier to just pull out the wipes and wipe down the counter tops. Instead of using a rag and spray (which can get everywhere) then the rag gets tossed in the laundry and bleaches out other clothing! With these wipes they can toss them in the trash and be done.	&&&
I carry the to go wipes everywhere I go, they are great !	&&&
Love the fresh smell and easy to use convenience of the wipes. I always keep a pack in the car and at my desk at work.	&&&
These are very handy, nice lavender oil aroma, and just the right size. I really like these hand wipes and will be ordering them again.	&&&
Good wipes, get baby clean well. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes I find that it leaves a little string behind. Not often, but occasionally.	&&&
Use these wipes all the time in the kitchen and bathrooms	&&&
I use Clorox wipes to sanitize surfaces around my house. I also use them to sanitize my office at work. They were also an item on the kid's school supply list this year.	&&&
I use lemon clorox disinfecting wipes in the kitchen to keep my surfaces clean and the lemon scent keeps the room smelling fresh. I would recommend use, they get surfaces clean with minimal effort!	&&&
I received Softy wipes in exchange for honest review. I wanted to review the wipes because I have kids, nieces, and nephews, who get into everything. From hair gel to peanut butter to soda . Their hands are sticky and nasty. The wipes help sanitize their hands and body parts, in addition to cleaning surfaces. I used the wipes on the stove top and cabinets and I liked the results. The wipes do not have a strong scent. I also like the size of the container.	&&&
Quick and easy way to clean and sanitize at the same time. Use at home everywhere. I take a container to my grandmother in the nursing home and use it to try to help combat all the germs there. Great product. I especially like the wipes because it keeps me from splashing Clorox on my clothes when I use it.	&&&
Clorox wipes are easy for me to use to clean up muddy prints from my floor from my dogs. I also use them in the bathroom as we have 6 daughters and they make clean up simple.	&&&
"These wipes were the best . At first I have to admit I thought they were pricey but I WAS SO WRONG. Its actually a good price for what you get, a TON OF WIPES. They are great wipes and I was surprised to learn you can actually use them on my toddlers sticky messy hands which is a huge plus for me. ( He loves to have waffles for breakfast which means = syrup = mess =unhappy mama ) These wipes have been a Godsend since I was sent them. I still have plenty left thank God. I will be repurchasing when I am done.
I also use them to clean up other things ( besides all the mess my 3 year old makes) such as countertops, toilets, the sink etc.
I will be repurchasing these when finished. I have even switched brands ( I won't mention names but I was previously a fan of a well known brand that makes wipes. I rather stick with a local company such as this though.)"	&&&
Clorox wipes are very easy to finish wiping off all surfaces and to get going!!!	&&&
Love clorox wipes! You can take them anywhere and we use them daily to wipe down counters and door handles (especially in the winter!)	&&&
Love these wipes. So easy and great cleaning power.	&&&
Best cleaning product on the market. Wipes are absolutely my favorite out of all your products but have to say clorox bleach is only brand I buy	&&&
These wipes are extremely moisturized, which I love and not too thick or too thin...the texture is good and the package arrived quickly....At times I have to let the baby "air dry" a bit before or I may just use a rag an pat the area dry but it's better than the wipes being harsh on baby's skin...i prefer these wipes to huggies any day	&&&
"I highly recommend these flushable wipes to anyone that travels a lot. I travel almost 200 days a year & I ensure these items are in my suitcase. These individually wrapped wipes are small enough to fit conveniently in one's pocket or purse."	&&&
I like how thick the wipes are, and they don't irritate my baby's sensitive skin.	&&&
These natural care wipes are great for babies with sensitive skin! My little one has eczema and I never have to worry that these wipes will irritate her skin!	&&&
I have a special needs, disabled child. One part of her challenges is her immune system is very weak. She asked me why I was using wipes instead of spray. I told her that sometimes when you spray "germies" can get pushed into the air and escape! But with the wipes you can sneak up on them and get them all!!	&&&
These are the only wipes I can use on my little girl she's allergic to many other brands of wipes an diaper's such as Pampers an parent's choice	&&&
Love clorox wipes. Super easy to use, great smell!	&&&
I've been a HUGE fan of your Bear Naked Wipes for years and so it was only natural to try your nail polish remover. I've been noticing that the cheap nail polish remover I bought at the drugstore was leaving my nails and my skin/cuticles dry and flaky. Your nail polish removers are, of course, FANTASTIC! I was able to use one wipe for my hands and my feet and they felt so soft and pampered afterwards! Thank you Josie for bringing us the best! Oh and the citrus hand cream is a super special addition too! I think everything you make is the best there is in the world! You rock!	&&&
Simple and sensible. For me its easier to pull wipes up and out. It lets you easily pull one at a time. I love it!	&&&
This is the only way to buy baby wipes! The box comes with three plastic, resealable bags of wipes so they stay fresh.	&&&
I can't live without these wipes. They are thick enough to get a good wipe, yet soft enough not to be too rough. I love the smell. And I have tried other wipes and none hold up as well as pampers. Thank you Jesus	&&&
I really started appreciating these wipes once I became a home owner. It is challenging enough to keep up with housework, but these wipes make cleaning my wood furniture so much more manageable, especially with two little ones running around. They are very durable, smell great, and are effective at cleaning dust off and leaving a polished look. I love the re-sealable bag they come in and have found they stay moist for a long time. The only thing I don't like is that I go through them quickly and they can be a bit pricey. I have tried a generic brand from a dollar store though, and it verified that paying a little more is definitely worth the quality.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes, keeps tables and door knobs clean of germs.	&&&
Great stuff! Use the wipes all the time in the classroom!!	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes. They come in convenient to go packages at my store to take with me easily or leaave in the car. I use them at home and at work at my desk to keep it tidy.	&&&
I use them everyday to keep my bathroom fresh and sanitized. The wipes are quick and easy to use. The best part is just throw them away.	&&&
I love these disinfecting wipes because they are easy and convenient. They make me feel I have a handle on at least the killing germs aspect of cleaning house.	&&&
Love the convenience of the wipes to disinfect after preparing dinner. Or in the bathroom to make sure germs do not spread.	&&&
"These sanitizing wipes, by Softy, will revolutionize the way you clean! I was able to clean the microwave and the stove without scrubbing. All it took was a few swipes and tough grease was gone. Other spills and stains, like coffee dribbles down the counter or cupboard, were wiped away in merely one swift motion. I couldn't believe how easy it was. Watch my 3 minute video as I clean the kitchen counter.

Plus, it can be used on hands! I don't know how they can make a wipe that smells so good, has Vitamin E and is good for the skin without burning or drying it out, yet still cleans amazingly well, and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria. These wipes do cost a little more than the store brands, but you will use many less. I used the same wipe for quite some time. It only takes a few to clean an entire room. So, in that regards, the price is comparable.

I received these wipes complimentary in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."	&&&
I really enjoy using Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for they are thick and durable with the added bonus of killing 99.9% of germs.	&&&
These wipes are very good for cleaning the dirty diapers. They stay nice and moist in my baby wipe warmer which most wipes will not. I would recommend these.	&&&
I love the wipes! Super convenient and make everything clean!	&&&
I always have Clorox wipes easily accessible! I have them under the kitchen and bathroom sinks.	&&&
I love Clorox products! I keep the to go wipes in my car and in my purse just in case. I think I've used almost every Clorox product there is and I have no complaints!	&&&
These wipes are thick and work well. I like the better than name brand	&&&
Kept my baby's booty clean!! The Unscented wipes kept it simple. Just as good as national brands. Do not hesitate to buy.	&&&
Perfect wipes for any platform or surface. Not just above most things, it is also good for. cleaning hands after the cleaning that you shall be doing. I was to the orphanage a great teacher and Good wipes	&&&
The wipes are not that moist so I would not buy them again unfortunately.	&&&
Really good wipes, and a good price	&&&
As Guy who takes pride in hygiene and general fresh behaviors I'm excited to add this new odor fighting weapon to my arsenal. Leaves me feeling clean without the residue I've experienced with other wipes. So dope, we be reordering. Thanks good wipes!!	&&&
The wipes themselves are decent. About what you would get if you went to the drug store and bought the store brand. I am not a huge fan of them, but they work. I HATE how when I am trying to remove only 1 wipe I accidentally pull out 3 or 4. I wish they would dispense better. It is especially frustrating when changing my toddler's poopy diapers when he doesn't want to hold still and I am in a hurry. What is even worse than the wipes though is the packaging. I bought a 6 pack of these wipes and so far 2 of the 3 packages I have used have had the hard plastic opening rip free of the package. Not only is it annoying when trying to open the package, but it means the remaining wipes are more likely to dry out because I can no longer completely seal the package closed. Horrible package design, and lack luster wipes.	&&&
We have been very pleased with these wipes. We tried a different brand and they did not hold up as well.	&&&
good wipes from Weiman Products. Epic to have and easy to apply	&&&
"These wipes are a must-have, even if you're not a germaphobe. I primarily use them to clean grease off of my stove and oven, and they're much more effective than paper towels. The Clorox brand wipes are larger and thicker than the store brand wipes I've tried. I tend to go through them at a pretty slow pace, but there's always enough cleaning solution in the wipes and bottle that they don't dry out, even after sitting for a while. The scents are nice; they leave things smelling clean without being overpowering.

I'm usually OK with store brands for household items, but these are one thing that I'll spend a little more on."	&&&
"I was a little concerned about using these wipes on our Chihuahua. She is sensitive to changes and we didn't want to make her sick. But, seeing all of the ingredients are natural and there was no chemical scent, we gave it a shot.

Well, she stood stock still while she was getting wiped down. We wiped her all over her little body. These wipes are kind of like baby wipes. They pull out the same but these are somewhat dryer. Baby wipes have that smell, too.

So, she didn't get very wet. When she was done, she didn't roll and carry on, like dogs do when they have a smell on them they don't like. After a few minutes, we checked her out. She is definitely softer and looks cleaner.

Her coat has always been healthy looking so I can't say if this helps for that but she does look nice. I think that she is a bit cleaner. She likes the attention and they seem to work pretty well. Way better than giving her a full blown bath.

I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own and with that being said... we love these wipes! We have officially switched to using ONLY seventh generation!	&&&
Works pretty well for the price. Soft and moist. Much better than Huggies wipes.	&&&
awesome high quality wipes! These are thick & soft, and get the job done!	&&&
My dog loves her couch and bed privileges but our apartment community doesn't do the greatest cleaning up the property and there is a LOT of pollen in our area - these wipes keep her from smelling like outside and tracking in dust and dirt (I have MASSIVE allergies). What's best is they don't irritate her skin or cause her to shed any more than she normally does. I will reorder when I run out.	&&&
By far my favorite wipes!! They don't rip when cleaning a dirty baby bottom but mainly I love them because they don't give my sensitive baby a rash. So many other products that have nice perfumes set his skin off. The price is also better than at my local grocery store so I just subscribe and save because I know I'm gonna continue needing them for about another year.	&&&
Somebody had given me a box of Huggies and they were unbelievably scratchy and not soft what so ever. Pampers is so soft and gentle, great value boxes of 808 wipes and very soft scent.	&&&
I find that these wipes really do pick up the dust when you are using them instead of just pushing it around on whatever you are dusting.	&&&
Our 7 month old has 2 little bottom teeth that just broke through so she's been fussy when we try to wipe her gums and teeth but these wipes are seriously magic! After her bottle, I wiped her little teeth and gums without a fuss or fight. I think she liked the taste of them too! I feel good using these tooth tissues because there are no harmful ingredients and are easy to use! Wish we had these with our other 2 kids when they were babies! I definitely recommend these and the wipes stay sealed well to prevent them from drying out! I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review and opinion.	&&&
"I like these wipes. They do a good job at quickly removing makeup at the end of the day when I don't feel like doing a full ""clean up."" I would have given 5 stars BUT my daughter was unable to use them, that said she has SUPER sensitive skin and they did irritate her. I however had had no issues. They are slightly thicker than other wipes I've bought. Good value.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review"	&&&
I came across this product from the YouTube makeup Guru "iheartmakeup92." She featured this product in her recent bedtime routine video. I figured I'd give the product a try since I've been concerned with how well my cleanser has removed my makeup. I like that the product comes with 30+ wipes. The wipes are well saturated and do the job of getting your makeup off. I found that the wipes do not irritate my eyes when I take off my eye makeup. My only dislike for the product is that the wipes leave a sticky residue on your face after using them. Unlike other makeup wipes where you can feel at ease using them, then rinsing your face and calling it a night - this product is at it's best when you cleanse your skin after using it. I found that on the nights that I didn't cleanse my skin after using it, I would break out. Who's to say that it is ONLY from the wipes, but after I began a routine of using the wipes to remove makeup, using my cleanser and going through my nighttime routine in it's entirety, I had no problem with acene.	&&&
I am always running out of these things but I love using them. They keep my glasses clean and streak free! It dries fast as well!	&&&
Seem to come a little dryer than expected, since they are to replace spray for cleaning glass. Overall work pretty good to clean window but would have to use multiple wipes	&&&
These are, by far, the softest baby wipes. I would highly recommend them.	&&&
They don't have any kind of re sealing method, you just open and put in a wipes container or warmer. They are not good for travel.Still they are great wipes durable and get the job done.	&&&
Never could go wrong with having wipes w toddlers lol	&&&
Obsessed with these wipes , usually get at Sam's was to lazy to go . The difference in your glasses is incredible. I put them in my purses , my fanny Pak, my cars you won't be disappointed. I use on my cell phone also !!!!	&&&
Best wipes out there they don't have harmful cancer causing chemical like the other brands	&&&
"I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
This wipes are great. I wear light makeup and they had no problems getting my face fresh and clean. My only complaint is the packaging. I had to put them in a ziplock bag because after 2 days I noticed they were drying out. Otherwise no complaints."	&&&
"I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I got this product and absolutely loved the wipes. They were wonderful for my baby since every other wipe broke her out. These wipes didn't. They are also great for the environment plus they are good prices and I love everything seventh generation. Stands for .I am a forever consumer for them	&&&
"Pogi's Grooming Wipes are large, strong & have a gentle formula. They don't have a scent & aren't drippy wet.

Our puppy had surgery today & didn't feel much like walking. She pooed in the driveway, then immediately sat down...in the poo! Oh, my gosh! With fresh surgery stitches that aren't to get wet for two weeks, I knew I had a problem that needed a solution. I pulled out Pogi's Wipes & began cleaning her behind. They were doing a decent job, but I had to do some clean up with very wet paper towels too. After a while I was alternating Pogi's wipes with wet & dry paper towels. I had to cut some mess away too. I cleaned as much as she would tolerate at one time, and continued cleaning her off & on during the day. Pogi's Wipes never tore & I eventually got her behind clean using them. Never once did the wipes irritate her or cause her to try to get away from me.

A few days ago, I wiped her coat down with them. The wipe pulled some dirt out of her coat. The wipe didn't dull her hair, nor did it add shine. She has a labradoodle coat which isn't shiny, but has some sheen.

I appreciate that Pogi's Wipes are gentle, extra large (8 x 9""), strong & Earth friendly. From the product picture, it looks like these wipes should 'pop up', so far mine aren't. I might've grabbed them the wrong way the first time I used them. This evening when I pulled a bunch out, I noticed they were zigzagging.

Ryley gives these her paw stamp of approval. I give Pogi's Wipes 5 stars.

Most wipes irritate my skin, but this is the only wipe that doesn't	&&&
I love pampers wipes!! I wish it was easier to get them with coupons at a cheaper prices!!	&&&
I love having these wipes around the kitchen and bathrooms for my 3 teenage daughters to clean up all their little messes!!	&&&
Love how it doesnt leave a sticky residue and smells great. My fav to use are the wipes.	&&&
Hate the lemon scent. Hate how wet the wipes are as well...I have to follow every wipe with a paper towel.	&&&
I just had my 4th grandson. My daughters two boys are 5 years apart and the new little guy does not like cold wipes. She has had the larger wipes warmer but she travels alot and I decided to try the compact one. We love it. wipes are warm and not dried out and it fits well into the diaper bag.	&&&
Love clorox wipes. So easy to use and love the scents.	&&&
The wipes make traveling very easy. When we travel for work they are easy to pack and use. When I enter the hotel room, they are the first thing I unpack. I can quickly sanitize every surface in just a few minutes.	&&&
I love using the Clorox wipes, because I have three small children who loves to play in dirt, plants and bring all there little germs in the house I use the Clorox wipes on everything even there toys. I have noticed since I have been purchasing the wipes my babies aren't catching common colds or viruses.	&&&
This is my go to product when cleaning the house. The wipes are very convenient and easy for quick cleanup leaves a clean smell.	&&&
The wipes also kill ant trails. I love that not only do they clean well, smell good, and disinfect, but they also keep ants from coming back.	&&&
I use CLOROX wipes every day after my students eat breakfast. It cleans the tables and disinfects. I also use them every day after they leave. This way I feel good knowing my classroom is clean and safe for my students.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes in the bathroom because I can toss each wipe after cleaning!	&&&
Had to use 3-4 wipes to clean. Wipes became slimy and unusable quickly. Water and a paper towel worked better for me. Save your money.	&&&
compact, and effective cleaning when and where you need it - I always keep some in my purse and the car - they seem to have a good shelf life.	&&&
This is definitely a useful product but not 100% perfect. We bought 2- one for upstairs and downstairs changing stations. The containers keep the wipes moist. Most of the time only 1 wipe comes out but sometimes more than 1 does.	&&&
It is just awesome. Super easy to use and dispose of. My parents wear glasses and they love the product.	&&&
Have used these wipes and Preparation H for years. They do help sooth the problem and were recommended by my doctor years ago.	&&&
The wipes container is very convenient with the easy-open dispenser. I love that it hooks on to my diaper bag so it won't fall out (that was thefeature that motivated my purchase). My only request for improvement is that Skip Hop change the direction to open the dispenser. It slides toward the side w/ the loop that secures it to the diaper bag, which means it slides open when I place it in a pocket while attached to the bag. If it were to slide away from the loop that connects to the bag, it would stay securely closed. I'm a huge fan of Skip Hop because they understand the little conveniences that make parenthood easier, so I'm surprised they didn't spot this snafu. It's not a dealbreaker yet, but may become one if it stays open long enough for my wipes to dry out.	&&&
"I really like the ease of these wipes. Great for a quick clean up in between baths. They smell great and make baby smell nice and fresh."	&&&
You can never have too many wipes with a baby in the house. It's better to buy in bulk. I get more every 2 months.	&&&
Operating a child care center can be hectic, being able to order these wipes online and have them delivered is so convenient! Also there is no shipping fee on orders above $50! The wipes themselves come is unscented- a plus for multiple children usage (with allergies & sensitivities), they are durable, work great and you just cannot beat the price!	&&&
I predominantly use Babyganics products on my children, BG are the only wipes I buy now. Great product.	&&&
The plastic wrapping around the the three containers lost color and when separating them left blue stain everywhere. Product was ok but wish they would fix the wrapping.	&&&
I carry these everywhere to clean my glasses. I keep reordering them over and over again. The price is great when you compare elsewhere like Walmart. Can't go wrong with Zeiss...if anyone knows lenses it's them.	&&&
this product contains sodium benzoate. i trusted this product and aubreys and would have never thought it would actually be harmful. sodium benzoate has clearly been shown to cause cancer. how can u put it in these products we trust blindly!!!	&&&
Our Suzie likes the flavor of these. She is 14 now and is missing several teeth due to abuse before she came to live with us. Since she has been having her teeth cleaned with these wipes, the vet often remarks about how good her tooth look.	&&&
I use strictly Seventh Generation wipes (& diapers.) I like the free & clear versions of products they offer. These wipes are thick & strong, but soft.	&&&
Great wipes, but who needs that many travel packs? My baby goes through roughly a box of these wipes in two months between home and daycare. But the travel packs last for ages bc they sit in the diaper bag and are used twice a week, three times tops. But you get three travel packs with every box. That makes no sense. This has officially become a rant. Bottom line: They're great wipes.	&&&
nice to clean and sterilize counters highchair or any ware	&&&
"Love buying wipes in bulk..saves time and money! Great buy! I buy once a month for growing baby!
Great price!!"	&&&
Great product, love how easy and compact these wipes cases are. They take up very little room in my bag and can be used with lots of different types of wipes.	&&&
Yaaaaay!!!! Finally a brand of wipes that doesn't use chemicals, perfumes or preservatives!!!! These are the ONLY wipes I will use on my daughter! Wish they sold them in stores!! I highly recommend!!!	&&&
The wipes work great and cause no rash or burn!	&&&
As a new mom filling up the sink with hot water and adding soap to clean the whole kitchen is just no longer realistic. I rely on these wipes every single day to get me through messy situations. I love that the wipes are strong, durable and disinfect all at the same time. They wipe away grease like its water cutting down on cleaning time significantly. The lemon scent is my favorite!	&&&
These wipes are essential in any diaper bag, especially when water/soap is not accesible to clean pacifiers, teethers, or any objects that baby drops and you can't rinse. Great for roadtrips, airtravel, etc.	&&&
We were given many kinds of wipes as shower gifts. But these are our favorite. They clean better and easier. And are soft. And we use less, making them last longer.	&&&
These wipes are overall really good. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the flip top design. The opening of the package, below the flip top is too small to fit the portion of the wipe that remains after you pull out the previous wipe. Often times this results in the top not being closed properly and the wipe dries out. Aside from this I like the scent and they clean pretty well. I personally would like a somewhat thicker wipe, but these are much better than Pampers wipes in regards to thickness.	&&&
I have been using these for the past year and had trouble finding them in stock where I usually buy them so resorted to ordering online. They are wonderful and have not caused me any trouble. I have sensitive skin and I have been thrilled that I have had no redness or irritation when I use these two to three times a week along with the Simple cleansing facial wipes. (I do not use them daily as that would be a little too much for skin to handle.) My daughters use them now as well and love them!	&&&
They wipes are ok, but they are almost oils and hard to hold. They often slip and then you get poop all over your hands...it's not pretty! I usually use the Sams Club generic brand and they are a better value and a better wipe. I got these to see if they were really any better and I don't think they are. The generic wipes have never bothered my kiddos and so I will continue to use those and save a fair amount of money at the same time. They also stick together really bad and so it's hard to get them out with one hand which is so annoying when you've got a little messy bum waiting!	&&&
huggies wipes are my favorite wipes. pampers never get the kids clean enough	&&&
Love these wipes!	&&&
Only wipes that I like to use on my LO especially at night when he's tired. No one would like a rough surface on there bum.	&&&
Love water wipes. They don't have any parabeens and make for a healthy safe way to use a wipe on your body or your babies tushie. A little pricey but worth the extra safegard aboiding parabeens. The are soft and durable.	&&&
I love these wipes. They're better than pampers sensitive in my opinion. You can't beat the price and delivery to your door.	&&&
I love these wipes not only are they a great price but they work just as well as top name brands. I have used almost every brand and these are the same quality to me. I like the light cucumber clean smell they have not top strong. They are sturdy and wet enough to get the job done right. I use these in a warmer and they are good quality and have not dried out being in warmer so they wetness in them is great. These are not the wipes you can flush they are folded together but I haven't hand any problems getting out what I needed. My sons does have sensitive skin but has not had any reaction to these.	&&&
"These are decent wipes. There is nothing groundbreaking about them, but they do work while causing little-to-no irritation (that is, no irritation for me -- I see that some other people who have used this product have had issues, so if you have particularly sensitive skin, you may want to avoid these, just to be on the safe side).

I have primarily been using them to remove eye makeup and stubborn lip colors. They do successfully remove eyeliner, eyeshadow (over primer), and mascara. (None of the eye makeup products I've worn since starting to use these wipes have been waterproof, though.) Every now and then I get a small amount (and I mean really small) of burning with these, but most of the time, I get no irritation. They are much less irritating than the Yes to Cucumbers wipes. (I know the product description says ""avoid contact with eyes"" but it is possible to use these wipes to remove eye makeup without actually getting liquid in your eyes.)

The wipes are soft and double-sided (i.e., both sides can be used to remove makeup and have similar textures). Although they say fragrance free, the natural ingredients do have some scent. (But it is not an added artificial fragrance, at least.) They are an appropriate size to remove makeup from your whole face (if you use both sides).

You can see the full ingredients lists in the product images and if you scroll partway down the product page. I did not find these to be drying, and also they left no residue after use (though I typically do cleanse after removing makeup).

All-in-all, worth considering at least once, especially if you haven't settled on a favorite brand yet."	&&&
"I have ordered these wipes several times. The wipes are thick and soft enough that they don't scratch, and they dry quickly without leaving streaks. The size is very good. The only problem I have had is when I order several boxes at once, the wipes tend to dry out a bit the longer they sit around waiting to be used.
I will keep buying these wipes, as they are the best I have used!"	&&&
I wish these were made from the same fabric/material as name brand wipes like Huggies. The material is super soft but thin and I feel like I need to use several at a time so that I don't get poo on my hands! Otherwise, I really like that they don't have any chemicals and there is no smell.	&&&
These are awesome. We have a dirt backyard and dust and dirt gets everywhere inside. These wipes literally pick it all up. It's amazing. So much so that we're now subscribed to get them every few months.	&&&
They shipped fast, I love them! They make my baby wipes warm. Love this product	&&&
Just picked these up last week and am in LOVE!! Still love the Micellar water but these wipes are A-m-A-z-I-n-G!!	&&&
Love Clorox wipes for everything around the house!	&&&
I use these wipes all the time for everything I clean. They are so convenient to use.	&&&
I like the ease of using the Clorox Wipes for cleaning door handles and frames. With 4 kids, I always have finger prints and dirt that needs to be cleaned.	&&&
I love having these wipes around the house. They are really useful , but was sad when i opened the third container and the wipes weren't perforated so i had to keep cutting a piece of wipe to use it. That was frustrating since i buy them because they are easily accessible. I will still keep buying them though."}},	&&&
These wipes are perfect for those that eat in their car, or have children. Spills? Sneezes? Vomit? No Prob! There's a wipe for that!	&&&
I love how I can disinfect surfaces conveniently and quickly with clorox wipes. I use the clorox brand exclusively now after trying off brands....they didn't work as well as the clorox.	&&&
With all the viruses going around I need to disinfect my house more often. I love Clorox wipes to do just that. I keep a container in every bathroom for quick cleanups.	&&&
Clorox products are awesome. Especially the Clorox disinfecting wipes which I use constantly to clean and disinfect my kitchen counter tops and bathroom. Easy to use and so convenient!	&&&
I have two cats that lay anywhere and everywhere,no place is sacred. I always have Clorox wipes on hand to clean and disinfect the kitchen and dining room tables!	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes! It's so convenient to grab one to clean up messes and, they smell so fresh!	&&&
I have no kids but I love these little wipes. The scent is great!	&&&
"The wipes work ok. So far they have stayed moist, but not too moist. However, there is a problem getting them out of the dispenser. I tried threading the wipes through the center hole in the top from the side and the middle. Neither worked. The middle sheet tore before I could get it up to thread it though the center hole. The side worked for one sheet but the other sheets did not follow after that sheet was torn off. The price was good and comparable to other products of this type. I would try another brand before purchasing these wipes again."	&&&
I am a male that has UC and Hemorrhoids, so anyone that has any form of IBS should understand the need to have a flushable wet wipe that is individually packaged for discretion. There are not many affordable options on the market to choose from. Wet Ones used to have one, but they discontinued the "flushable" wipe that had similar characteristics. The only downfall to the PureTouch Flushable Medicated Wipes to me are the sound of the packaging. I really wish that I could carry it in my back pocket without the noise. I also really wish that I could use it in a public/work restroom without someone in the stall hearing me unwrap it. Again I am a male and stealthy discretion for using such sanitary products is very important to me. I am a private person and would prefer to keep it that way! Other than the wrapper noise I would recommend this product to anyone who needs it. It has all but one of the characteristics that I am looking for.	&&&
we use only papmers sensitive size 4 and this is the only place i can find them, i have the bonus of having them delivered and not running all over looking for them	&&&
Exactly as promised! I'm a radiology resident and take these to work to clean the screens, very useful. Also have a touchscreen laptop and an Ipad, which they work great for. Worth it for sure. Haven't really tried it on my camera, though I should.	&&&
These are handy and work extremely well. They can be use up a little too quickly if you do not watch yourself though. I would recommend monitoring yourself when using these otherwise they become costly. If you do watch how you use them they do save you time and money. But the best part is that they protect your silver very well.	&&&
These wipes get monitors in our office pretty clean. I can tell they are removing some old junky film that has accumulated on the monitor surface over time. But the wipes are a little on the dry side and I fell like I have to use several of them to get a really good clean. The wipe itself is a good thickness and holds up well to some scrubbing, I just wish it had a little more cleaning solution on it.	&&&
These wipes work very well and truly cleans lenses. I *think* the wipes are soaked in isopropyl alcohol plus something else. I don’t care as they work well and are easily carried in one’s pocket. Highly recommended.	&&&
love these wipes! thick, gentle and smells wonderful! don't need to use multiple wipes to get the job done. highly recommend this pampers product wont go back to store brands again!	&&&
Great, inexpensive wipes for the whole family. We always have a pack in the bathroom. Good for cleaning up the dog after her walks too.	&&&
It helps a good cause which is the main reason I purchased these a second time. It doesn't cause any problems for my sensitive skin or irritate my eyes. Unfortunately, the wipes are a bit dry and do not remove all makeup, especially eyeliner and mascara(I don't wear waterproof). I use these pre face wash. I can't just use these wipes and go to bed.	&&&
My absolute favorite baby wipes. They are just the right amount of softness and wet wipe to get the job done. A few wipes goes a long way!	&&&
"Great wipes.. much better than the ""Store brand"" which I get locally.. They feel much softer and smell about 100x better.

Mostly use them to clean around the house nowadays but still wiping our boys butt too haha

Price was better than in store also and even shipped! Amazon has one great product here.. wonder if they will make diapers soon"	&&&
I love these wipes! Never have a problem with them irritating my baby's skin!	&&&
I am too old to be a mother with a newborn. However, I am an artist and I find that the Kirkland Baby Wipes are one of the best things to clean my hands from oil paint. I ordered two cases as I keep a case at home and one in my studio. I know that several have complained that too many come out at the same time. I don't have that problem as I am conscious of grabbing the top wipe only and pulling one sheet out slowly. They are affordable, sturdy, and smell clean...unlike turpinoid and Gamsol.	&&&
I do like these wipes, however I prefer the natural ones, so give these a 4.	&&&
By far the best baby wipes I have ever used. I was excited to try them due to the high rated reviews, but even more excited when I saw the quality of them after the first use. I will be buying these again in the future!!	&&&
Best wipes period!	&&&
Doesn't really do anything. I am not impressed. I love Earthbath's shampoo but I have not been impressed with their wipes.	&&&
Huggies is the best diapers and wipes ever!! Its the only diapers and wipes we buy! They do not leak! They fit my son great he has chunky hips and no other diapers fit like Huggies!	&&&
No scent, good thickness. I don't have to use double the wipes for some jobs!	&&&
Much more fragrant than I anticipated. Will stick with the Sensitive wipes in the future. I love Pampers wipes, though. They do not stick together, so you only get one at a time, like you're supposed to. And they do not leave lint on my baby, like some other brands.	&&&
Works great, easy to carry around and use all over my family room. My only complaint is while the Pampers wipes case fits in it, the lid lifts a little which can dry out wipes a tiny bit. Lovely color.	&&&
I usually have to choose between the Simple Radiant and the Simple Exfoliating wipes. Obviously I usually choose Simple Radiant which have exfoliating beads on one side. The texture if Simple Exfoliating wipes is too rough for my skin, even if they do remove my makeup well.	&&&
These wipes are great for tiny hineys, but are a bit thin for a larger toddler hiney and sticky poos.	&&&
These are not my favorite wipe. They tend to just spread the mess instead of wipe up. I like Amazon wipes way better.	&&&
By far, these are my favorite hand wipes. I used to love the Target brand hand wipes, but the Germ-X has a more pleasant scent and softer in texture. I'm the type of person that hates having sticky or dirty hands, so these are great and handy to keep in my purse or when I'm traveling to keep my hands clean. These wipes are also great for quick wipes for spilled food on clothing as well!	&&&
I use this before I wash my face at night. I take my makeup off. it doesn't take all of my makeup completely off as I can see some foundation on a cotton ball when I wipe my face with astringent. I use this because it doesn't burn my skin or make it sting as regular makeup remover wipes do because of the alcohol content. It's sensitive enough for me, and it works for now until I can find a more effective makeup remover/skin cleansing wipe.	&&&
I received these from Generation Good to try out for free! Best wipes ever! I love the way they feel and how they are not rough to wipe my babies bottom with. I will definitely be buying these all the time now. They are more moist than a lot of wipes too and only take 1/2 of what a regular wipe would. Would definitely recommend these to everyone I know with babies!	&&&
This case is great, like the look as well as the functionality. The slide top is a great concept to keep your wipes dry. Wish it was a little more compact.	&&&
Great wipes, I use them all over the house. Great for hand wipes too! Very durable.	&&&
Love using Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. They are quick, easy and efficient. I use them at home as well as in my classroom. The Lemon scent leaves a fresh scent as well.	&&&
These are great wipes for all around disinfecting and they smell good.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. They are my first go to for cleaning the kitchen after my husband cooks! If you have seen my husband cook, you will know Clorox Wipes are miracle workers.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. I look for products that are easy to use and get the job done in a timely manner so I can get back to my kids & Clorox wipes are just that. Its fast acting, easy to use and I know whatever I use it on will be clean!	&&&
Love the clean fresh scent and disinfecting agents.	&&&
These wipes are so easy and convenient to use! I couldn't get my housework done without them.	&&&
great product, love to use it on surfaces before my baby gets to it	&&&
I feel comfortable using Clorox wipes with my two young sons. I know it disinfects my counters, and is safe for the kids,	&&&
Wipes are very convenient. Sanitary because you can throw away.	&&&
Love to use this product. It cleans and disinfects at the same time. Helps me save time when I am in a rush.	&&&
I have two girls that can get messy at times and these wipes make a moms life so much easier.	&&&
"Quick and easy way to clean your pump pieces without having to find a sink. Works fantastic for office environment"	&&&
These wipes don't remove eye makeup as well as I'd like, but the package doesn't make any claims about mascara, so that's ok. Great for my oily T-zone.	&&&
There are few products I can use that I don't react to (soaps, lotions, etc). This is one of the few products I can use. I've tried generic "equivalents" and had a reaction. If you have problems with sensitivity, this may work for you.	&&&
I appreciate buying a big box of these wipes. They work very well.	&&&
These wipes are actually pretty good. They're soft, thick, appropriately sized, and doesn't cause any irritation to our newborn's bum.	&&&
We've tries to use other less expensive wipes but always keep coming back to these. Definitely give them a try, you won't regret it.	&&&
"The wipes work ok and they get the oily finger-leavings from using the touch screen, but they seem a bit small to be able to use with a full hand so I find myself wadding up a few so I can clean an area larger than my fingertip at one swipe. Also, they are so flimsy that they can't actually "dispense" one at a time through the dispenser hole. I have to open the entire top and pull them off the outside of the roll. Seems to me they haven't actually tested them. Because they were sold in a two-pack of 100 each it will be a while before I will be purchasing more, but when I do, I think I will try another brand."	&&&
Scent and size are great. But our lab/boxer mix gets very flaky skin when we use these on him. We'll use them on his paws only until the box is empty.	&&&
We had to give these away to friends, etc. Lyla has sensitive skin and these seemed to keep her bottom red and somewhat inflamed looking. We are now onto Huggies Natural Care wipes.	&&&
"If a product does what it says it does on the box - I do not care what it costs.
As a veteran of amazon and ebay - I am used to being ripped off with postage and handling fees - and the exchange rates.

I refuse to get ripped off by a product failing to perform how it says it should on the box - and for other people.

Having used 2 containers of catcrap - and spending minutes a week cleaning and rubbing my clear visor (on my Harley davidson full face helmet 3 months old)... I was going to buy a third... until I came across this.

Checking, rechecking, weighing up postage costs, time to deliver, I bought off ebay in USA.

I had lasik eye surgery on my eyes 27 days ago - my eyes are dry to say the least. the dark padded sunnies I wore to work this morning were useless tonight, riding my Buell home in city traffic, at night, in the rain, in Autumn (the humidity is noticaable - probably 75% or so?).

I cleaned the inside of my visor with silicon spray - and outside - and my helmet never (yes never) fogged up at all , even for a second or two) when I rode home with visor down and miniscule vent open at chin....

Catcrap requires frequent opening of the clear visor - esp stopped in traffic.

I do not know about how many uses per wipe - but I recieved exactly this picture - 3 wipes.

Like I said - I dont vare what it costs - I need it to just work.

I had high doubts, but I did not feel nervous in such risky conditions - this does seem to do what it says, how it says....

Ive not come across a product that works better, quicker, easier"	&&&
it works	&&&
i cannot live without those, i have them on every floor of my house and in the car, as well as at work.	&&&
"I love Clorox wipes!
I use them everywhere, kitchen, bath, and toys. Any hard surface, after someone is sick in my house has to be wiped down. I love using these because they disinfect and are easy to use!"	&&&
"With winter here and running noses these Boogie wipes are awesome! My son hates any one playing with his nose and these have helped me keep him looking so cute! :0)"	&&&
i like the clorox wipes i can use them for anything around the house	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use! And with the multi packs I am able to keep one container in each room I need them in so I don't have to take from one room to another. Plus the smell great, love the orange scent!	&&&
The wipes are easy to use and so convenient. Gives me piece of mind to know everything is clean!	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy and convenient. I love them!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes for everything from cleaning bathroom cabinets to kitchen cabinets. Also great for quick cleanup jobs when you are in a hurry.	&&&
I've only used Clorox wipes a few times but I've been happy each time. I'm looking forward to using the glass wipes next!	&&&
I love the smell and the cleanliness of the Clorox wipes. So easy to use and leaves a powerful clean smell.	&&&
These wipes are sturdy, scent free, and gentle on baby's bottom. I usually only have to use one on a poopy diaper (Unless it's really, really bad). The only complaint I have (which is minimal at best) is the package that I bought wouldn't always stayed closed....a little work need to be done on the packaging to keep the wipes there freshest & wettest. Please note: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&q uot;	&&&
I use Lysol wipes all the time! They're so convenient and easy to use, it's hard not to want to use them. I especially love how versatile they are--door handles; sinks, counters, shelves, etc. My inner OCD LOVES these wipes and getting three at once is a heck of a deal! These three will last me quite a while, so I'm pretty happy about that :) Thanks, Amazon!	&&&
My daughter has sensitive skin so I always look for a wipe that won't irritate her skin. I liked that the wipes were thick but I cannot pull out a wipe one at a time, it always sticks to the next causing 2-4 to come out at a time. Very wasteful and frustrating when dealing with a dirty diaper. It also has a smell of alcohol? not exactly sure what it is. Guess I will stick with Pampers sensitive which I can usually find for the same price if not a little cheaper anyways.	&&&
This is the best stainless steel cleaner I have ever used. Took away rust better than the many other brands I have tried. I used it on my stainless steel gas oven and I tried it on the porcelain top and it melted away all the build up grease and grime. Gives the porcelain an amazing shine. Easy to use. Also used on the gas diverter tops that are also porcelain with heavy usage for over 6 years and with bakes and burnt residue on them and they also turned put amazing looking. Wish I had used this product years ago. It's made my kitchen appliances look brand new again. I also used it on the plastic knob and it completely removed all the grease and oil buildup in the crevices. Be careful with the knob though, if rubbed to hard over the color print on the knob it will start to remove it as well. It restored the knob to looking like I replaced them with new ones. Makes me wonder how well it may clean on other surfaces. Drawback is that it could use more wipes in the container. I would pay more for a larger quantity if available.	&&&
These wipes are phenomenal! Way better than using normal tissues or other wipe brands. My niece suffers from allergies throughout the year and these work great! Also a life saver when she has a stuffy nose due to a cold. Def recommend these!!	&&&
I was so glad to receive a request to try and give an honest review for the Pogi's Grooming Wipes to use on our Lab. She loves water and mud so she often wants to come in and needs a good cleaning. When it is raining, it is a pain to go outside and use the hose to clean her off before she can come back in the house, plus then she is all wet so we have to deal with her shaking water everywhere. The grooming wipes work great on her feet and lower legs to eliminate this problem and make it easier to take good care of her and keep the house cleaner too. The grooming wipes are fragrance free, eco-friendly bamboo-based and hypoallergenic, which means they are good for the environment, which I like.	&&&
...Lysol Disinfecting Wipes can be used as a convenient way to clean and disinfect your household surfaces. Each pre-moistened disposable wipe kills germs. wherever you use it. No bottles, no sponges, no mess. Lysol cleaning wipes are great for cleaning most surfaces and disinfecting surfaces	&&&
Delivered quickly and in good condition. I've used other grooming wipes and been disappointed with their durability & the fact that they dry out quickly. Pogi's seem to be of much better quality than I expected and they're doing a good job cleaning up my frequent messes	&&&
we love, love, love these wipes. They are so soft and gentle yet get the job done without irritating my daughters skin	&&&
We received these wipes for free in exchange for our honest opinion and I can honestly say that we loved these wipes! My daughter has sensitive skin and these wipes worked perfectly for her. They are thick and super absorbing without the toxic chemicals in other wipes. Love these!	&&&
Only wipes that I like to use on my LO especially at night when he's tired. No one would like a rough surface on there bum.	&&&
I love these wipes they remove all of my eye make up with just one wipe! The only thing is that they leave my face a little oily after but a little bit of witch hazel i am fine. Please note: I purchased this product at a discounted rate in exchange for a honest review.	&&&
I love pampers and will keep buying. Love how they get the job done. The wipes arent too wet or too dry like most. Plus they make my husband happy.	&&&
We've used many brands of wipes and these are the best. They are thick, soft, moist and gentle. Love them! They will definitely be part of the next baby shower gift I give.	&&&
Plain and simple container, but just as good on every aspect as the high priced wipes. I think what initially attracted me to these is the plain packaging. Fancy and artistic containers are costly and therefore you pay the price. I am elderly and therefore am partially disabled. It's quite a chore to get up and down to use the sink. These wipes are beside me at all times. I use them for everything, sticky or dirty. Be smart, you won't regret it.	&&&
"Great Wipes. Starting Chemo and needed something to keep things clean and sterile. These wipes
do the trick everytime."	&&&
This were better than expected. I liked that the case kid is spring loaded and the way it dispenses better than the name brands!! I will say I feel like the wipes will dry out faster than name brands but it's rare that they are not used by that time.	&&&
"We love this product. My daughter has bad allergies and constantly has to blow her nose. With a three year old that can be a little challenging. With Boogie Wipes they are soft, smell great and my daughter does not mind me trying to clean her nose. Try that with a regular tissue and she will fight you an the task."	&&&
These are my go-to makeup remover wipes. They don't break me out and they're tough enough to remove even the most stubborn mascara.	&&&
My son has sensitive skin, and these wipes are great for him.	&&&
Like these so much better than Clorox wipes. Don't hurt your hands. Smell better.	&&&
"I especially like the fresh, pleasant smell. I use these for a quick swipe clean of my vinyl flooring when attached as Swiffer floor pad. These wipes are larger and thicker than most and do fit a Swiffer. Also great for sanitizing bath fixtures, kitchen counters, etc. I was pleased to find a source to purchase these again."	&&&
Love these wipes!!	&&&
Great wipes, refreshing scent!	&&&
These are the only wipes I buy anymore. They are strong and don't tear when pulling them out of the package.	&&&
"I love these saline wipes for my one and a half year old son. He refuses to let me spray saline solutions into his nose when he's sick or his allergies are flaring up and so these wipes are the perfect solution. He's even interested in wiping his own nose now. I would highly recommend them to those with stubborn little ones."	&&&
I received a trial pack from Generation Good to try for free. I loved these wipes so much that i completely switched my kids to these! The seventh generation wipes are soft, strong and you don't have to worry about the ingredients being harmful to your babies ? We use wipes for a lot of things in our house, thesehold up to cleaning up paint, marker, and yet are soft for little faces, hands and baby bottoms ? I tell everyone about the seventh generation br and, if you are looking to get the chemicals out of your home without breaking the bank, Seventh generation is the way to go!	&&&
"I don't have small children in the house, but I always have baby wipes. Ever since my kids were small I've kept baby wipes in the house. They are older now, but I always have baby wipes in the house. We use for everyday wiping of hands and always have some in our cats.

This is the first time this I have purchased the Fresh Scent Baby Wipes. I am pressed with these wipes. I love the delicate fresh scent. They are extremely sturdy and work marvelous.

I like the fact that I was able to buy them in bulk, so I do not have to keep running to the store."	&&&
These are fairly good makeup remover wipes, and they remove makeup well,, but the reason i put three stars is because they dont smell well at all! If Im going to put something on my face, it should smell well, for starters. I have had makeup remover wipes that smell worse though, so i guess It could be worse. If you dont mind that type of thing though, then these are good overall at scrubbing and makeup removing.	&&&
Great wipes, good value. Would buy again	&&&
The whole family loves these wipes. They are non-irritating like some wipes can be. The only annoying part about them is that they really stick together. You frequently pull out more than one.	&&&
I got these because everyone in my family has really sensitive skin. These are nice for that they don't bother my daughters skin at all. However they're a bit dry and come out in bunches so you go through them really fast. I guess that's a good thing though because every time you shove wipes back in your adding bacteria to them. They don't clean as well as sensitive wipes with more in them. They aren't awful, they work ok and aren't too thin or too little but they could really be improved. Think I may just start making my own with reusable wipes because these weren't the best option for me.	&&&
These wipes do exactly as expected and are equal to all alike brands.	&&&
"Germx individual hand swipes, There are so many reason I recommend this brand of wipes.
Large in size all around
Easy to carry
Great for getting small stains out
Moisturizing
They are great for my line work (constantly hand washing) Give them try you like'em too...."	&&&
Love using Clorox wipes to disinfect my infants toys and play mats.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the perfect go to for everyday disinfecting. I keep some in my car for quick & easy clean ups on the go.	&&&
love these wipes they are so easy to use and get the job done	&&&
Its the best stain removing product I have ever used and only use clorox wipes to disinfect and clean my house. Thank you.	&&&
Great product, nice portability, better than Handi-wipes	&&&
These wipes don't tear easily, I've used other big name brands and expected better quality, but these are still the best I've used.	&&&
I use this product in my Holistic Health Clinic and absolutely love it. I have this product in both the blue and green version and they are all look great. This dispenser is great quality, actually much better than I expected and keeps the wipes very moist. The dispenser has a weight that holds the wipes in place and that you pull the wipe you are getting out at the time through and I have to say that I love the design as the wipe pulls out perfectly every time. It is important to me here in a clinic setting that this is easy to use and that people aren't necessarily having to touch and pinch through wipes that are underneath the one being pulled out. I am very pleased with this product and as the boxes that are in all of my therapy rooms here in the clinic get opened dozens and dozens of times per day I will definitely be purchasing replacements of these exact dispensers when these finally wear out. I would highly recommend this product.	&&&
I do not care for the stiff material. I am glad that it is wet enough, but it is not pleasant using it because of the cloth that is like stiff paper.	&&&
I have two little boys with allergies, and these wipes have been a saving grace for their sensitive skin. They're great cleaner uppers for both diapers and anything else you might need on the go like little hands and faces.	&&&
Baby is not here yet, but I have tried these out! I will always have a pack of these in the diaper bag. No nonsense way to safely clean those dropped pacifiers & toys. Ingredients are baby friendly/safe. I can foresee these saving our sanity in public situations!	&&&
"I used this to clean my five whiteboards in my classroom and I didn't realize how dirty they were until I cleaned them. This product works really well to remove all the marks. It does sometimes take a few cloths if the board is really dirty but they look like new when you're done."	&&&
"I use these at work for two reasons. One because I pump in a bathroom so I wipe down all surfaces before and after I pump and then I use a separate wipe for the actual pump."	&&&
I always use these. They both cleanse and sooth irritated skin. I often use them in addition to toilet paper for better cleansing.	&&&
I tried the Huggies wipes but these are much more absorbent and soft. Actually use less of these than the Huggies so well worth the extra cost.	&&&
"This is such an amazing pack of wipes. It comes with everything you need in just one box. A diaper wipe dispenser, refills, and take and go packs.

The wipes themselves are fantastic. They are thinner than other wipes which means that they stay warmer, and my baby doesn't cry when I wipe her with these. They clean just as well as thicker wipes and I have never had an issue with getting myself dirty using these wipes. There is almost no smell to them and they have not irritated my daughters skin at all. Her skin dries quickly as these wipes are not soaking wet. This helps keep her from getting diaper rash.

My only issue with the wipes was that the dispenser did not fit in my diaper caddy. I ended up moving the wipes into a different dispenser so that it would fit. It fits on the changing table though so I will still be using it.

A great value, for a great box of wipes!"	&&&
I don't see anything "natural" in this diapers. Same Huggies diaper...just with a little bit more lotion on them. I am surprised how easily manufacturer can call a product "natural" here in US. There are no 100% natural diapers, but there are definitely better options out there!!!"	&&&
These wipes are good for travel or eating out situations where no water and soap are available. They have just the right amount of moisture on them and they are a good size for most hands.	&&&
these are strong wipes that I keep in the bathroom to clean up my kids' messes. They work great and are easy to use.	&&&
These are excellent for your baby's sensitive skin The wipes are gentle and definitely get the job done. Thanks huggies!	&&&
These wipes gave my newborn diaper rash despite their sensitive labeling. I Turned to 'water wipes' and it's cleared right up!	&&&
"I like this Eye Makeup Remover Wipes. It leaves your face feeling refreshed and clean when you use them. I love that I get two packs for a low price. The only thing that I needed it to have is more moisture. As soon as you take it out from the pack, it feels dry and doesn't feel moist. I was surprised that when you wipe it on your face, it feels more wet on your face than it do on your hand when you first take it out. When I do use it, I probably would use 1-2 wipes (it all depends on how much makeup you put on or your preference). But overall, I like how it makes my face feel clean.
Discloser: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange to give my unbiased and honest review."	&&&
These wipes are great and reasonably priced. I can't remember the last time i bought a differnt brand.	&&&
What can you say they're wipes. They do the job well.	&&&
"Pogi's Grooming Wipes - 100 Unscented Fresh Wipes are a convenient and effective way to wipe your pet of dust and dirt. We have multiple dogs and our backyard has a digging pit. Needless to say the dogs get dirty while playing. Using these wipes before they enter the house is a great way to keep both the dog and the house cleaner. The wipes are large and work very well. One of our dogs has severe allergies that causes some skin problems. These wipes are hypoallergenic and do not aggravate the dogs skin condition.

Highly recommended.

Sample provide for unbiased review."	&&&
Great wipes in a convenient pack. I use them to wipe my dogs paws.	&&&
Not a fan of Pamers wipes they're too soapy	&&&
love these wipes. they are soft, yet resilient. they get the job done and leave my little one clean and happy!	&&&
These wipes stay moist and smell GREAT (like Starbursts in my opinion). Doesn't irritate my puppy's skin and he seems to enjoy the smell as much as I do.	&&&
these wipes are great better than the name brand they don't tear easily	&&&
The price was right and pampers is such an amazing company when it comes to baby. They smelled nice and were very soft. Got these for my newborn nephew and he never had an issue. Still uses these because they are the best on his skin. He has excema and the formula they use for the wipes doesn't break him out.	&&&
These wipes work great on my interior truck surfaces, to include the dash, plastic trim and leather seats. Even with caked on dirt on the interior handles, this wipe cleaned it right off. Does not leave an oily finish like some other products, and dries to the touch. This is the best product I have found for quick wipe-downs. One wipe does my entire truck interior. I highly recommend this product for routine cleaning to keep your vehicle looking good.	&&&
I'm always a big fan of these wipes. They can clean almost everything. I usually buy them at Costco but I think the home delivery subscription is actually better.	&&&
they are great would recommend 100percent. they are wonderful especially when you have a child	&&&
I love these wipes. Pop one or two out, wipe the area or glass off, toss in the trash. DONE. They leave no streaks behind, We've all had those last-minute visits or pop-ins from friends. The one room in the house they're all going to visit will be the bathroom. That's where my CLOROX wipes have a home--right under the cabinet. I can make a quick run in there, wipe off the mirror, check the sink, swish quickly around the toilet rim & seat and done...I now have an instantly fresh bathroom for guests. In the kitchen, I use them for everything: wiping off a splash on the fridge door/shelves, or swishing off the counter top after cleaning the kitchen for the night. I keep the canister right there on the sink, so after the husband and kids get done playing with the outside kitty or working on something--they can wipe their hands or tools off instantly. Not only do they CLEAN, THEY DISINFECT AND KILL GERMS. These are the best thing to come along since the lint roller, and I keep a stockpile of them in my cleaning closet. Nothing tops these, and if you ever stop making them, I'm coming to the Clorox plant to picket!	&&&
The wipes can be used on just about everything to clean and disinfect.	&&&
I love using these Clorox wipes! I use then to clean all different rooms in my house!	&&&
I love using the wipes because they are convenient, very fast and don't smell like straight up bleach	&&&
I love these wipes, they are easy to use and disinfect well.	&&&
Cleaning is not compete unless Clorox is involved. Love the products!!!!	&&&
I love these wipes. I use them everyday. I wish they were on auto purchase	&&&
After getting my baby boy circumcised i switched to the sensitive wipes and they seemed to be more gentle on his skin. While using these wipes he stayed calm while getting his diaper changed. When I had used the other wipes he would get upset like they were aggitating his skin. So very thankful Pampers has products for babies in all situations!	&&&
Perfect to clean pump. No problems with the wipes. Easy to store. Overall great item.	&&&
I use these to clean my iphone, ipad and computers. The only issue I have is they seem to be a bit dry right out of the package so I need to use multiples to clean even my cell phone. I have purchased these before at my local Costco and did not have this issue.	&&&
My husband was in the hospital and they used this wipes. I went looking for them locally. They were difficult to find and when found much more expensive.	&&&
I have been using these wipes for a long time	&&&
As a first time mom of a 6 month old, I was given a bunch of different kinds of wipes. I have even tried making my own. I always come back to pampers sensitive wipes. Love how they make baby's butt clean without harsh chemicals. Thank you Pampers!!	&&&
Amazon wipes are ok. They are not as sturdy as Huggies wipes, in my opinion. But they get the job done and they are well-priced. Plus, the unscented option is pretty huge, as some of the name brand ones have very strong scents.	&&&
I developed skin irritation, an allergy, to regular wet wipes, so these were a wonderful find; plus they are larger than standard wipes. Also a terrific value here.	&&&
"I tried these wipes out onto my friend's very nervous dog. Much to my amazement, he seemed very happy after I applied a wipe all over his fur. In fact, they seemed to cool him off and what I noticed the most is that his DRY COAT NOW HAS A SHEEN!

What I like about these wipes:

1) Easy to open and close the container/pouch. Seals well to keep the moisture inside on each wipe.

2) Wipes remove one by one similar to baby wipes and these are easy to travel with say on a road trip.

3) These should work well on a cat as well.

4) Gentle to use on a dog or cat as some of the ingredients are Aloe Vera Extract, Vitamin E.

Sample provided by Pogi's Pet Supplies for testing and reviewing purposes. I will say that I think these wipes are just as advertised, or better."	&&&
I love these makeup remover wipes by Specific Beauty. I am lazy when it comes to my facial routine and having these wipes make it much easier. I just have to grab one and wipe my face with it. There are little beads on the wipes to exfoliate your skin and make sure all the makeup, dirt or grim get wiped off your skin. They are great quality and don't fall apart in your hands even when you have to "scrub" a little area to get that makeup off. Stubborn mascara comes right off with a few wipes. I have very sensitive skin and this has not irritated it one bit. I would and will recommend these to friends and family. I have received these at a discount for a honest review in return.	&&&
"I was really looking forward to using these wipes. They had great reviews and are competively priced. Unfortunately they gave my one year old daughter the worst rash she has ever had. It looks like she had an allergic reaction to an ingredient. Painful bumps all over. I'm very sad about this. It hurts to see your child in pain and this happened as soon as we switched to these wipes, we changed nothing else. Now, I know other babies may be just fine with these, but my daughter has never broken out like this from any other wipes.

I bought the unscented kind so maybe I should have tried the sensitive ones. Unfortunately, I will not be trying anymore of the Amazon elements baby wipes because I would hate for the same thing to happen and waste money.

As for the quality of the wipes, they are kind of thin, which I was expecting for the price and after seeing other pictures. They are not bad, however. They have a good amount of moisture and clean up well. I would have used them had they not caused a rash. However, I believe there are better wipes out there that are priced the same. I have yet to find a ""perfect"" wipe though. I would compare these to other store brand baby wipes, which I switched from and never had any problem with.

I gave two stars because I can find another use for them, use them to clean up messes and for myself, no problem. However, I am unable to use them as baby wipes, which is what I originally needed."	&&&
I am a huge Pampers wipes fan and I think that these wipes definitely compare to Pampers. For the price I would even choose these over pampers going forward. They are not dried out like some "cheaper" wipes. They are not as thick as Huggins which I like. I am not a fan of Huggies. I feel like these wipes also clean better than Huggies. So in other words the only two wipes I will use is Pampers and these!!	&&&
The instructions say to keep away from the eyes! I was disappointed because I bought them as EYE WIPES!!!!!	&&&
Great wipes! Never fall apart and always get the job done.	&&&
I love the lemony smell and the fact that it kills germs on contact. There isn't anything that comes close to effectiveness of Clorox brand products. I will always be forever faithful to my Clorox wipes.	&&&
GREST PRODUCT...I WOULD DEFINITLEY RECOMEND TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS--	&&&
I've been using Clorox for many years now due to the fact that it cleans about everything around the house. I've used it in my kitchen, bathrooms, floors and even on my walls!	&&&
"These wipes are a great help around both the home and office. They claen up messes and leave behind a fresh scent."	&&&
Love the Wipes, great for toys, high chairs, tables, pretty much everything!	&&&
Love all the Clorox wipes...the ones for windows are really convenient too	&&&
I use these wipes for almost every surface in my house for quick clean ups!	&&&
Baby wipe warmer - could you think of anything better? I can't. Can't wait to use it on the little bottom and I already love that it keeps the wipes so warm - perfect..	&&&
These wipes are great to use for cleaning monitors, smartphones, tablets, etc - any electronics! Perfect moisture content so able to use on multiple items with same wipe. Leaves no residue - just a clean item after use."}},	&&&
we use thee wipes in our home because we have a 3 year old and there I nothing easier than cleaning up mess with these wipes. we use them in every room and even keep them in the car for when we go to the park. Who knows what he may end up picking up at the park but as soon as we get to the car I know I can clean things up with no worry.	&&&
Excellent product to have around. I use the wipes to clean my counters after unwrapping meats. They are also convenient to have around when picking up after my pet dogs.	&&&
We love our clorox cleanup wipes because they disinfect quickly without all the fuss.	&&&
i use the wipes i love them convenient easy to use and they are moist enough thanks	&&&
This is a really great deal and the wipes are durable. I do use A LOT when there is a #2 diaper so the 648-count price is worth it for me. They aren't thick but they're not too thin either. It gets the job done! My baby has had no issues with these.	&&&
Nice baby wipes.	&&&
This are the best natural wipes I have found. Not too thin or too thick. Very pleasant scent. Do not dry out.	&&&
I have been using these len wipes over a year and they are the best I have found anywhere. They are anti-fog and anti-streak which is a must if you work outside or ride a motorcycle or bike. Pdi wipes are like rain-x for your sunglasses no wipers needed.	&&&
I started potty training my two year old bot and got these wet wipes to help when he goes #2. He can get the wipes out easily and it works really well.	&&&
I been purchasing this product for about 1 year and I love them. I keep them in my purse, workbag, nightstand and in the care. I have even suggested to a friend to place them in her gym bag.	&&&
i bought one of this when i traveled and fell in love it is gentle on my sensitive skin and i only have to use one wipe most times. It does wonders love this too much!.	&&&
I ended up returning these even though I had registered for them for my baby shower. Somehow didn't register that these were primarily polyester. I got the prince lionheart warmer which came with a few samples of the warmies (bamboo and cotton blend). They were so much softer/more natural feeling than the grovia wipes. Will get a mix of the Warmies and the thirsties wipes next to see what I like best.	&&&
The wipes are fast and convenient for everyday messes. Has been a lifesaver when you have a little one always on the go and a mess to quickly clean and disinfect .	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes. They wipe up and kill all the germs around my house and leave it smelling clean.	&&&
The wipes are a quick and easy way to disinfect especially with little children in the house.	&&&
I don't like the smell of most strong cleaners. And the earthy cleaners aren't always enough. The green top clorox wipes are my go to disinfectant wipes when we are sick!	&&&
These wipes are great for cleaning up areas fast and leaving a nice fresh smell behind.	&&&
I am a total germaphobe and I use Clorox wipes on a daily basis. They are convenient and they work well to disinfect and clean. Using Clorox cleaning products makes me feel better about killing the germs around me. :D	&&&
If you have kids and/or dogs you need this product, cleans up every body fluid they can throw at you.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are used constantly in my household. They are tough on kitchen messes and great for the bathroom too,	&&&
This is the best on the go product when you have a small child. My three year old is always touching and putting stuff in his mouth; and yes I mean STUFF, from the table at a restaurant to the seat of chairs. Disgusting I know! I always use the wipes to wipe down the table and chairs at restaurants as well as the handles on shopping carts. I don't know why the most filthy items in the world seem the most tempting to little ones. But i can be a little more at ease knowing that clorox has cleaned the item	&&&
I do not like the new "triple clean" layer wipes. They are too thick, and leave soapy residue on my son.	&&&
Love these wipes. I've used other brands that I don't like nearly as much. They don't rip or irritate my daughter. Pretty wet which some people may or may not like. I prefer it. I like that they are alcohol free.	&&&
Really helped with dog nail scratches.....great wipes!	&&&
Really nice wipes! I was pleasantly surprised to be honest. Mine all came with the plastic flip tops which is great for the diaper bag but also to refill my wipe warmer. They are very soft, don't leave behind anything and aren't too wet but also aren't too dry. My daughter has very sensitive skin (we previously only used Seventh Generation wipes) and she has not had a problem since I started using these. I like that these wipes also do not have any parabens, chlorine or even alcohol. Something that you don't always think about is the ingredients in your wipes and some popular name brands contain ingredients that I do not wish to expose my daughter to. One thing about these wipes I will say is that I wish they didn't contain Disodium EDTA. These packs are nice and big though! I will definitely continue to purchase.	&&&
Doesn't remove waterproof mascara as stated. I use Lancome eye makeup liquid on Neutrogena wipes to remove	&&&
I recieved these wipes for free and my opinion is 100% my own. I love these wipes. I like that they are fragrance and alcohol free. I like to use them for my whole family. We all have sensitive skin. My baby will get redness from other brands.	&&&
This product was gentle on the baby, who is prone to rashes, and we need a sensitive wipe like this one. The only complaint I have is that it's *too* thick. There aren't as many wipes in the package as there are for thinner brands, so you run out faster... and my husband swears thicker ones don't clean as well when he does the diaper changes. We're still trying other brands until we find the perfect product to do the job.	&&&
I have tried several brands of wipes for my little one but nothing compares to Seventh Generation wipes. I started using them and was impressed with the quality. They are very think and softer then other brands. Because they are thicker, I used less when changing my child. They are also very affordable and are cruelty free. I just love everything about the product and brand. I received a free product for the purpose of my review.	&&&
Wet wipes. They were wet. They were wipes. Can't get much better than that.	&&&
These Lysol wipes are great. These wipes are wet enough to clean oily kitchen area and dries very quickly. After we use these wipes the surface will be completely disinfected. We can use these wipes in sweefer mop even. We get three big bottles and taking out the wipe is also easy. I really like these wipes.	&&&
I went from using these on the nights I was too lazy to wash my face, to using them every day. They do a great job getting off my make-up and are refreshing. However, it is difficult to pull just one wipe out of the package at a time. I would give these wipes 5 stars except I feel I am wasting them when I pull out several wipes when I only want one.	&&&
I am a first time mom and I have just tried the Pampers baby wipes Sensitive on my baby and I haven't had any problems with then. I recommend everyone I know to use them.	&&&
You need to use 2 wipes at a time.	&&&
Wow these wipes are great! Perfect for on the go self cleansing. Good wipes give you the confidence to perform well, and smell even better, when ur walking that perfect 10 home from the bar	&&&
These wipes are nothing difference compare to other top brand names. I personally have trusted Pampers and Huggies and only use those on my baby. When these wipes were on sale on Prime day, that when I decided to give them a try, Yeah, on me first and now I came back for more.	&&&
"My chihuahuas are both 15 years old so they get pretty stinky. I can't really bathe them anymore because it wigs them out too much - I'm always afraid they're going to stroke out while I'm bathing them - so these wipes are perfect! I can quickly and easily wipe them down. It causes them minimal stress which makes me feel better, too. They smell nice after I wipe them down. There's no scent in the wipes so they just smell clean. We wipe them down once a week or so, much more than we ever bathed them, but it's so easy and they don't seem to mind. It's so much better to have them on your lap when they don't smell like funky old dog!

PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.) Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below. I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours. This item was provided for review consideration.

These are the softest, moist wipes I have ever bought. Having that said, they are also very strong and don't rip like other brands do. It is a plus that they are chemical free. With other brands I tend to use a hand full of wipes just to get the job done, with these I use much less. Love them.	&&&
As a lot of reviews mention these are not for the casual disinfecter. They are heavy duty and should not be used around food contact surfaces. With that said, these are great I use them almost exclusively in the bathroom. The reason I use them over Lysol type wipes is that they don't leave behind any kind of residue. I hate that residue you get from most cleaning wipes. I give 4 stars just because they're kind of scary toxic.	&&&
Great wipes! Never fall apart and always get the job done.	&&&
"I really wanted to like these. They smell fine and haven't given my baby a rash or reaction. Those are the positives.

They are really thin and not as soft or stretchy as the Kirkland wipes that I'm used to. My two major complaints are that the packaging is badly made and there is a little removable label on the bottom that seems like a choking hazard to me. The hard plastic part that seals the wipes are not attached well. I had one that was completely off at delivery and I had to stick it back on. They don't seem to deal well either and I've had them leak in my bag."	&&&
Hello I recently purchased a box of the Mickey Mouse style wipes, after opening them I quickly realized there was glass or some small pieces of sharp material covered on them. I can no longer use them on my little one and am quite concerned by this. I decided to look up weather or not it has occure with anyone else and was outraged to find out many mom's are having this same occurance. I typically buy the Cucumber and Green Tea one and have never in 7 years had a problem with them. I would not reccomend this exact product to anyone else at the moment, I am very disappointed with my product. I would like to see this problem resloved quickly. Thank You.	&&&
Awesome all natural wipe for pets! We use this product on our pups feet which they always seem to walk through something which then gets everywhere! These wipes are reasonable and best of all they are all natural. They have a clean scent to them. I would highly recommend these over "Commercial" chemical wipes. I will be buying these again!	&&&
These are my absolute favorite disinfecting wipes! Clorox is my go to brand and they keep their moisture. I have had no issues with these disinfecting wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best way to disenfect your home and they are so easy to use!	&&&
I like to buy products that are more natural for our baby. We have tried a few different types of wipes including the Honest Co and still prefer these. They are scent free, do not irritate my baby's bum and are sturdy but still soft.	&&&
Clorox wipes are awesome. i use them all over my house to clean and disinfect!	&&&
I love using the clorox wipes. Its convenient and give me confident in my space after I use the wipes.	&&&
This is great to carry around the house if you're not going to be running your newborn to the changing station every 2 min. Fits diapers, a container of wipes, and has a drawer to fit creams and a brush. I'm up to size 3 diapers already and I still love it.	&&&
Easy clean up and disinfection. I use Clorox wipes daily	&&&
These wipes are a staple in my house for quick cleanings. I use them the most in my kitchen and bathroom. They smell great and work even better to wipe up spills and disinfect items. I can't be without them.	&&&
wipes work very well. They are very handy to have around the house.	&&&
I stock these wipes and use them to clean up on almost every job. I even buy them for home too. Works well on paints, caulks, general cleaning and disinfecting as well as cleaning out my car and truck!	&&&
The seventh generation wipes have been great for both of our kids. We haven't had any reactions and the fit the bill.	&&&
These are pretty good wipes. They work well and don't contain a whole bunch of harmful chemicals. They don't smell terrible, in fact, they don't smell at all, they're fragrance free. I love that, because quite a few wipes out there just smell so strong! They aren't too thin, they are durable, so its easy to work with them in cleaning those wee little bottoms. The one thing I don't like about them is that when you pull one wipe out, the following one should follow right? Not with these wipes, a chunk (4 or 5 wipes) of wipes come out at a time, then you have to unravel and pull one out manually. This isn't so great when you have only one hand free to grab the wipes with. I hope they improve this.	&&&
Like these a lot only wish they were a little bigger	&&&
I love huggies wipes. They don't rip and fall apart, and they smell great. I have used then for years.	&&&
These were not my favorite Pampers products. Sometimes, half a wipe is all you need. But we found that these wipes ripped horribly -- would tear jaggedly and also leave linty bits all over. I know P&G probably isn't designing their wipes to be used like this, but a penny pinching mom's gotta do what a penny pinching mom's gotta do, and these ain't helping me do it! Also, the scent was a little too strong/artificial for us. If the price was super low on a sale I might get them anyway, but not my first choice!	&&&
I always find Pampers products to be useful. I love their diapers, and their wipes. That is why I buy them in larger quantities, and from Amazon. I find that they hold up well to the most stubborn of messes, and they leave my daughter nice and clean. They are perfect, do not tear, and stay moist a lot longer than others. I will always order these products, for my current child and future children.	&&&
save your money, these are the worst wipes. They tear really easily when I pull them out of the wipe warmer we have. They really are the texture of a wet facial tissue. I have to use about 7 of these if my little guy poops.	&&&
These wipes are better than any other wipe I have used! As a new mom I chose to use Pampers because of they were unscented, soft and clean very well!! Everyone should use Pampers!!	&&&
I use there to clean my glasses, as does my wife. I also use them to clean the screen of my computer, my iPhone, or any other thing that requires a lent and scratch free application.	&&&
These are soft and don't rip like Huggies wipes. These hold more moisture than Huggies wipes also. These smell better than the pampers sensitive wipes also. New moms should try these first.	&&&
my 2 month old baby has diaper rash. After we use this wipe, the diaper rash is gone. It's soft and contains lotion which protect the little butt. I am glad that I switched to pampers sensitive wipes.	&&&
"These pre-moistened lens cloths wipes have a ton of positive reviews and Zeiss makes high-end optical equipment so I figured the wipes must be good. Before they arrived, I was using some cheap wipes from Lenscrafters. I didn't like them because they were basically just abrasive paper towels soaked in alcohol. Much to my surprise, when I opened the Zeiss wipes, they were identical.

For cleaning glass, I think these Zeiss wipes would be fine. But I can't imagine they are safe for coated glasses or lenses. They are simply too rough. As you use them, the alcohol starts evaporating immediately and you've only got about 30 seconds before the wipe is bone-dry and then capable of scratching your optics. No one-- no optometrist, photographer, or astronomer-- will EVER tell you to use dry paper towels on your optics.

I'm going back to using a spray and a microfiber cloth. I wanted the convenience of these pre-moistened wipes to carry, but unless I can find a brand with a softer material, I'm not going to risk the coatings on my optics to this."	&&&
I never did like the flushable wipes because they were not thick enough and I was always afraid they would tear and get a mess all over my hand. These are thick enough to do the job right and get yourself clean, I buy these on a regular basis.	&&&
These are very thick, good quality wipes. No problem so far. My baby's ass loves them like fish love water.	&&&
Lysol dual action disinfecting wipes are a multipurpose marvel. I have used them on everything in my kitchen, on my automobile and in my laundry room. They are especially helpful on my ceramic-top kitchen range. They wipe-up stains in a "wink". Another surprising use is on my inlaid bathroom floor. Where a mere wet wipe product cleans the surface, the dual action wipes clean beneath the surface. They require a little "elbow grease" but they "do the trick". A suggestion for the future might be that they be increased in size to fit the "Swiffer mop head" and could be attached to it for more ease of use.	&&&
These wipes are very easy to use anywhere. I keep them in the room for a quick wipe down.	&&&
Not as good as some other store brand wipes that I've gotten before but definitely my most favorite of the name brand wipes. Not irritating to baby's bottom, 1 or 2 wipes and done, they don't break apart like some others do and the fresh scent is great.	&&&
This box holds a dispenser as well as packages of wipes. DIspenser helps to keep the wipes moist as it has a lid that snaps shut. Dispenser is good looking and decorative to the bathroom. Easy to open when needed. Shipment was prompt. These wipes have many uses in my home.	&&&
I always get these wipes they are affordable and clean up my baby easily.	&&&
Excellent wipes dispenser. Keeps them moist and weighted properly so that you get the wipe and not the whole dispenser with it. Perfect for when you are holding a wiggly baby with the other hand. Highly recommended! Bought one for my parents too for when they babysit.	&&&
The wipes are much better than using the spray can and towel. They leave less streaks.	&&&
Nice scent. Thick with the right amount of moisture. One side of the wipes is textured which helps when using for cleaning hands. Better than most of the more expensive brands. Don't tear.	&&&
Love this item! This is our second one. The first one stopped warming after a little over two years. We use cloth wipes in here:)	&&&
i use these wipes for everything. cleaning kitchen and bathroom counters, shower walls, even for disinfecting the inside of my car. i would recommend them to anyone for their convenience and the awesome job they do at getting your countertops clean - quickly!	&&&
Quick clean up. Use on face and also to refreash under arms etc...	&&&
I love these wipes. I've been using them for a few years now. I think they help resist fingerprints.	&&&
Love the lemon scent of these disinfecting wipes! Makes the whole house smell clean which is important for me and my family. The Clorox name gives me a sense of security that i'm protecting my loved ones from germs, especially during the cold and flu season.	&&&
Clorox has always been used in my family to clean and disinfect especially during the cold an flu season.	&&&
these are my favorite cleaning wipes! I love how well they clean up tough messes and they smell great.	&&&
I used clorox wipes alot to disinfect most of my things in my house. I love all the clorox products.	&&&
Love the convenience of it and knowing it disinfects so I don't have to worry about my little one getting germs from the kitchen counters!	&&&
Gentle on my baby, these wipes are the ones I use. Stands up to any "mess"	&&&
I want wipes for my daughter that are free of chemicals but work good. I've tried about 10 different types of all natural, etc & these are hands down the BEST! Never rip like other brands, are soft & don't dry out.	&&&
I like keeping my workspaces clean both at home and in my office. Doing a complete wipe down of my desk and peripherals on a biweekly basis. Just gives it the clean feeling. Lysol wipes are my best friend!	&&&
Super soft, thick and perfect! They aren't TOO soft so they actually clean the bum great. They are GREAT quality, absorb well and are big. My favorite wipes, and an AWESOME prices. I tried the Charlie Banana Organic Wipes which are the same price but only have 10 and they REFLECT water. These are fantastic.	&&&
"I tried these because I love the original formula but these have the micro lock technology that helps trap extra dirt and grime in the wipe instead of spreading it around the surface you are cleaning.

As far as cleaning wipes go, you really can't go wrong with Lysol. You get the power of a cleanser with the added bonus of being a disinfectant. These are great around the kitchen because when I prepare food such as meats, I can clean up the excess blood and meat products and all the while also disinfect the surface with these wipes. I get a nice clean table and cutting board that is also nearly germ free.

The micro lock technology helps pick up more dirt and you can actually see it on the wipes. They're great for around the bathroom and kitchen and especially on any surface that frequently gets touched by hands. They help combat the cold and flu and I've noticed a significant difference in illness being spread at my home. It just isn't as frequent since we started making sure to sanitize and disinfect. Overall I'm satisfied. Also, to me, these smell a bit better than the original."	&&&
Nothing much to say other than these wipes do their job with most diaper changes only requiring one wipe to be used. They are thick, don't dry out in the ziplockable bags they are stored in and they don't dry out in the huggies wipe containers that we use. Excellent wipe, no scent, and our son's sensitive skin is not harmed at all. Great product.	&&&
I like the thickness of the wipe. Not too thick and not too thin. But they dry out too fast. I made sure the top is closed tightly eachtime I use them but comparing to other brands, they do dry out much faster and it almost seems like they're just paper towels, not "wet" wipes .	&&&
I love these wipes! Never have a problem with them irritating my baby's skin!	&&&
All the other wipes that we've used in the past seem to tear really easily in the wipe warmer but pampers seems to withstand pretty well! Would not use any other brand!	&&&
These are very good wipes. I ordered them twice and have never had a problem with them. One of the best botanical disinfecting wipes out there.	&&&
The wipes themselves are ok but the package is horrible. Each package we have had the plastic piece to open it comes off so we end up losing the top wipes because they are exposed if the packaged it bumped or played with	&&&
Just recieved my order and I'm quite impressed. Both my Boston Terriers love to sun bathe and roll around in the dirt. What made me purchase this product was that it is hypoallergenic and it is fragrance free. Using Pogi's wipes was the best choice ever! Other brands didn't seem up to par, but these are blow other brands out of the water. Removed all the dirt and made both of my dogs coats shiny. Will buy this product again!	&&&
Way to rough on my babies skin. Going back to making my own wipes!	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have used Seventh Generation products for a while now so I did have an idea of the quality I should expect. First off I love the new flip top on the packages. The old way with the sticky flap just was not a good way to close it up at all. Most times if you didn't get it sealed the right way you had to throw a couple of the top wipes because they had dried out. That's a waste and no one wants that. With the new flip top it basically eliminates that problem completely. The wipes themselves are a bit different as well. They're a slightly different texture and they're a bit thicker. I have no problem getting the kiddos butt cleaned with a couple of wipes, but for bigger messes I'm left reaching for more. I've never had an issue with the kiddo getting a rash from the wipes. Obviously different babies skins will react differently to any and all wipes, if your child gets a rash then stop using it. Overall though I would highly recommend these as they get the job done without all the extra chemicals and perfumes in other wipes.	&&&
Great wipes, soft and textured , great combo.	&&&
I love these wipes, I only use them for wiping my daughter's face and hands though. I like these because it's 99.9% water and 0.1% grape seed extract so if she puts her fingers back in her mouth she's not getting all those "other chemicals" that the other wipe brands have in them. Because there are no chemicals in these, you do have to use them within a month from opening them or else they can get moldy hence getting your little one sick or giving them an infection (why I don't use them for diaper changes). I would've given these a 5 star rating but the opening in these wipes really are annoying. It's impossible to pull out only 1 wipe. Otherwise these are awesome!	&&&
I pour a bottle of alcohol in these to use as disinfecting wipes!	&&&
"These disinfecting wipes are extremely useful in my family and work life. I have multiple medical conditions which require me to remain in an extreme clean environment, and have wipes in each room of my home and office. They are effective and get the job done with no horrible smell or residue. They leave a light and refreshing scent, and getting the value pack with multiple scents leaves our home and office both clean and pleasantly smelling very good!
It is easy to open and retrieve the wipe, and snaps closed with the press of a finger for secure storage. Highly recommend!"	&&&
Great wipes. No irritation. Not to thin not to thick.	&&&
These are textured wipes that make clean up much easier. We usually order another leading brand. I received a package of these for a baby registry and really liked the quality. So we switched and bought a whole box. These are soft but the texture helps wipe baby poo away. They are still soft on my daughters sensitive skin. The wipes are not sopping wet, nor are they too dry like other brands. They seem to be all around perfect.	&&&
Good price for basic baby wipes. No irritating chemicals or at least no chemicals that have irritated our skin. We use these when we travel and for basic cleanups. The scent isn't overpowering. I like the thing you can scan for the "story" of each thing of wipes. No slimy residue which is a huge plus.	&&&
Best baby wipes I've ever used, been using pampers until I discovered these. I have two kids.	&&&
Love this wipes case. It's slim and fits easily in our diaper bag in the outer pocket with the changing pad. Easy to refill and it's less bulky than other cases. Also is much more durable than traditional wipes cases because it has a ziploc style close vs a clip or button.	&&&
I love their wipes! I use them for everyday clean up as well as weekly cleaning all around the house.	&&&
Such an easy way to clean up after the tot and know that the germs are disinfected!	&&&
I use the wipes because I have three kids and they are easy to have them wipe things down with them.	&&&
i love Clorox wipes. I would definently recommend them to friends.	&&&
I love these wipes . They are so easy to grab to clean up little messes or to disinfect counters and really everything.	&&&
I love these wipes because they are thicker and softer than other brands.	&&&
The wipes are so easy to clean with and they dont take much force to erase the dirt away,	&&&
I love these wipes, I recently bought these because I hate how at the end of the night after wearing a brightly colored lipstick that your lips still glow after wiping them with a tissue. These wipes get the remainder of my lipstick off and leave my lips feeling refreshed and hydrates. This will be in my beauty staple now!	&&&
My family love Clorox Wipes!!!! We keep a bottle in every room!	&&&
Worry not that these are half the price of everyone else's: they're great! Lightest "I'm clean" smell you'll probably find. Purchased for a trip to Southeast Asia, but now I keep a pack in my car.	&&&
With so many contagious things going around, I can be sure using Lysol Disinfectant wipes on my door knobs. handles, phones, I can be sure that I'm doing the best I can to avoid spreading diseases.	&&&
I love these. My 6 month old has been snuffly and snarkly all winter. She does not like having her nose wiped at all, but at least with these, the snot wipes off easily and thoroughly, (even the dried snot). Her face is not chapped or irritated when I used these. You could use baby wipes, but I would rather use just saline around her face. The unscented Boogie Wipes are hard to find, too. To further reduce chapping, I usually put a thin layer of Aquaphor on her lips and cheeks (although there is usually much squirming involved in the whole process).	&&&
So happy to have an eco-friendly product for toilet training. Regular toilet paper can't do the job. Plenty of moisture in product, soft for sensitive skin.	&&&
It's very convenient to have a flush-able wipe and these are supposed to be ok for a septic system. They really don't have the cleaning power that a traditional wipe has. I think if the kid was potty trained and actually went in the potty it would be easier but mine is still working on potty training and I can't clean his messy bum with these.	&&&
My mother has always used Clorox products, and now I am using them myself at my home. I have a 3 month old and love disinfecting everything and Clorox does it for me:)	&&&
I have a child with severe health issues and I love the fact that I can quickly sanitize any hard surface.	&&&
I love using these wipes. They are so easy to use, smell great, and work amazingly.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best. The fragrance that they leave is so fresh.	&&&
I used to use sponges but found that my counters and appliances smelled I did change out the sponges regularly, but still once you use them once the sponges just no longer seemed clean. I switched to Clorox wipes and, bingo, a clean smelling house. Now I don't have an issue placing things on my counters as I'm not worried about the dirt lingering.	&&&
I love clorox wipes- we can't live without them in our house or our kitchen we have a 4 year old who loves to play with his syruo and his food- its always stuck all over our kitchen table- we must use these wipes all day to follow him after he eats on the walls and on the tables- everywhere.	&&&
I buy Clorox because I know it's a product I can trust. It sanitizes and lets me know my family is free from germs. The fresh scents keep my home smelling good and the powerful bleach gets and keeps my whites looking their best. In my opinion this is the best product to use around the home.	&&&
"I love Clorox spray and use it on my countertops. It makes the whole kitchen smell great.
I love clorox wipes for quick clean ups, especially in the bathroom!"	&&&
I love these wipes. I buy them for the school. They always ask for disinfecting wipes and i always buy clorox.	&&&
Best wipes around. Thicker than others and clean up everything.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great! They are easy to use and so convenient!	&&&
These wipes were purchased on prime day for a fraction of the price. I've been using these for the last month or so and they are very good quality wipes. The thickness of the wipes make it so I only need about 3 for the big poops. Would buy these again, I just wished they have a rewards points program.	&&&
"I bought these for my fiance because she's pretty big into makeup and she currently uses Neutrogena face wipes she gets from Sam's Club and she's been pretty happy with those. But... I figured I'd get these for her and take a shot on something new since these were a little cheaper. After about a week with these new wipes, she is not happy at all. It was kind of funny, these were so bad at getting her makeup off that she ended up using her current wipes to finish the job.

Let me put it to you like this, she was wiping so hard to get the makeup off that her face turned bright red. The only saving grace was that they had a pleasant smell and she said they didn't make her face dry out like the Neutrogena wipes do.

Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
I purchased these face wipes for my two English Bulldogs. They are so susceptible to getting final infections in their folds. I used one every day per dog for a week to get rid of the infection. They worked great! The dogs didn't like the smell of the wipes, but they did tolerate it. The wipes cleaned well and left a fresh, clean smell in return. I've already ordered more for when these run out!!	&&&
I was sceptical that these wipes would work as well as name brand, and I was so surprised! Not only wee these wipes just as good as name brand, they save our family a fortune!	&&&
I know there are a lot of moms out there who hate fragrance wipes but I am not one of them. My daughter is on daily stool softener so sometimes it can smell pretty bad but as soon as I open the wipes my house starts to smell amazing. By the time I'm done changing her it's almost like she never pooed. I love love love them!	&&&
I have been buying these wipes for years and love them. They are very soft, individually wrapped, and easy to tuck in a pocket or purse. What I don't like is that they are no longer available in the Sam's stores. Now I have to order on line and pay shipping.	&&&
Great value for the price. But the wipes get too wet halfway into the pack	&&&
Amazon elements baby wipes sensitive are very nice no scent really and very sensitive for than baby skin made with quality material..great product..I received this product in exchange for an honest review..	&&&
I used these on my keyboards and small electronics. The duster is good in removing small particles stuck on my my keyboard keys. The wipes are decent in removing soiled dust in my computer/laptop monitors. Even used in cleaning up my eye glasses. I had to follow it though with a dry cotton cloth to remove the small amount of streak left (similar to other wipes cleaners)	&&&
I like that these wipes are individullay wrapped and have the "snap" closure rather than the sticky tab. I always have problems with the sticky tabs- they eventually stop closing, thus drying out the wipes. I never found a whole box of wipes with this type of closure. The wipes themselves are very gentle and strong. My son and daughter never had any skin issues while using these wipes. Love them!!	&&&
These Clean and Clear Makeup wipes are the only product I have found that actually works . ,,I also have sensitive skin and I never have any breakouts.	&&&
I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I used one of these wipes today, my face felt clean and refreshed.	&&&
We ran out of wipes while shopping so I picked these up on the go. They get the job done but they are very thick so they don't always make for an easy wipe. My daughter broke out with a small rash while using these and I think it may be because they are a lot more moist than other wipes we have previously used. I would not purchase them again.	&&&
These wipes are fantastic and a great value, too. I'm relatively picky about my wipes and I was unhappy with the various huggies brand wipes. Pampers sensitive were pretty good but expensive. I'm definitely glad I tried these!	&&&
I really love these wipes. I always used a different brand and I switched to these. I have to say these are so much friendlier and safer for my kids. I will not be going back to the other brands.	&&&
Our two year old daughter gets rush with some wipes we bought before. We tried Huggies and she was totally fine! No more rushes!!!She loves seeing Mickey Mouse in the packages and all the cool designs!	&&&
it wipes well like all other baby wipes but damn getting it out packaging its a B!#^!#$ch ..you can't just pull one out, when you try to get one out, you likely get 10 more with it.. UGH!!.	&&&
These wipes are wonderful nice and thick and clean up baby quickly. I switched from pampers wipes	&&&
Great wipes. There was not a thing to complain about.	&&&
They are great. Wash everything possible with them	&&&
"Perfect to clean pump. No problems with the wipes. Easy to store. Overall great item."	&&&
I love this product. I needed something slim and flexible that would fit a reasonable amount of wipes that wouldn't dry out. This fit the bill perfectly. Initially I had bought a planet wise wipes pouch. And while I thought it was ok the wipes ended up bunched together and as a result I'd grab far more wipes than I needed also they dried out in a couple days. So glad I made the switch the wipes lay flat in the buti-pod and I'm able to get a wipe at a time. I am going to order 2 more for my other bags	&&&
These wipes are great! I keep them in my bedside table to use at night before bed. I usually shower right before bed and don't use them. But, sometimes I'll do my workout in the early evening and then shower. I walk around my house barefoot as much as I can and it's nice to be able to wipe them down before getting in bed. They are a little on the small side so I took one star away for that. But, they clean well, give a little tingle, and don't have any residue feeling. So, I'll continue to buy them.	&&&
The bath wipes seem to do the trick of in-between baths, especially if you have a shar-pei with lots of wrinkles that have to cleaned throughly.	&&&
My daughter has never had a diaper rash. I attribute it to always using these wipes, and the pampers sensitive diapers!!!	&&&
My favorite of all brands of wipes I've tried. Nice thickness!	&&&
As a mother of 3, I have tried lots of different brands and types of wipes before. My favorite had been Member's Mark, until I discovered these Pampers Natural Clean Wipes offered on Amazon Prime. I just love the idea of having baby wipes on subscribe and save. This way, I never run out. These wipes do not give my baby, who has sensitive skin, a rash. They are also just the right amount of moisture...not to wet, not to dry. I would recommend any mom to try these wipes out.	&&&
"I am a bit obsessive about sanitation, especially in the kitchen and the bathroom. Dealing with mixing up cleaning solutions and wiping things down constantly can quickly become a hassle. That is why I jumped for joy when I discovered Clorox Bleach Free Disinfecting wipes. So easy to use, and yet another great Clorox product that I can trust.

While they're not meant for heavy duty cleaning, they are great for wiping off counter tops, the stove, the microwave, toilet seats, bathroom faucets, etc, as a daily routine. I appreciate the fact that by taking two minutes a day and a couple of the wipes, I can drastically reduce the amount of germs in my household without a ton of effort.

The scent is light and citrus based, not too overpowering. The wipes don't leave behind any sticky residue either, which is a problem with some cleaners I've used.

The only problem I've encountered with the product is more of an issue with the container they come in. If you don't close it up properly, the wipes will dry out in no time. And I also have trouble getting the wipes to feed through the opening so that I just pull one out at a time. I usually end up having to unscrew the lid and just pull out the roll and tear a couple off because they won't come out as intended.

But don't let the packaging deter you. This is a great product."	&&&
"Lysol Disinfectant Wipes do a pretty good job and smell nice. There's nothing new about this product. It is a tub of wipes that have a disinfectant fluid on them. You pull one (or more) out of the dispenser and wipe down an item or a surface.

This brand does an adequate job -- very similar to other brands. I really could not see much difference between the different brands I tried. The scent is a matter of personal choice, and I did like the lemon-line scent of Lysol.

These Lysol wipes a pretty tough, durable cloth. I have never had one ""fall apart"" in my hands. It isn't anything that is strong enough to actually SCRUB something, but that's not how I use them anyway. I scrub or clean the item. Then I just wipe it with the Lysol wipe for the disinfectant properties.

They are a little expensive when comparing to a disinfectant spray and a paper towel. And I don't think they are an especially good value for the work they do, but they do a good job."	&&&
I use Pampers Natural Clean wipes primarily after my daughter has pooped in the potty. She loves them!	&&&
Love amazon wipes!!! perfect absorbency, u can use one wipe to wipe away a good poop- literally. I have used in the past huggies, pampers and target and like these ones best	&&&
First time mom and so surprised that I would notice the things I did about wipes. Best thing about these they dont stick together when youre trying to get ONE out of the package. Other major brands are even perforated on the edge and take two hands to pull them apart I would like to know who has both hands free when trying to change a poopy diaper lol	&&&
"The improvement was radical. I used this on a silver platter that was horribly tarnished and afterwards I could see my own reflection.
Since it comes in the form of wipes, I don't have to worry about apportioning a liquid cleaner or any sort of mess like that."	&&&
"These wipes are great for getting all eye makeup off. I use waterproof mascara & eyeliner due to moist eyes & it removes all the makeup with no problems. I like everything about these wipes except they seem to leave my skin sort of oily so I have to wash my face afterwards too. That's not a big deal at night but I like to use wipes to fix makeup errors sometimes and these don't work for that because of the oil afterwards.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
It catches all of the poo and pee your toddler can dish out!! Wipes and scent disk are gimmicky....kid likes it and it works!	&&&
It helps kees the wipes moisture, a little bit pricy. Make sure you moisturize the pillow first before you put in the warmer.	&&&
I've tried several brands of wipes and I really like these. They are just moist enough to get the job done without being too wet. Plus, they have a pleasant scent that reminds me of a visit to a spa (a nice thought while I change a dirty diaper!). I continue to buy these even though they cost a little more than some other brand.	&&&
I put this in my diaper bag. I wanted something to put my wipes in instead of spending more money buying the small packaging of wipes every so often.	&&&
"Recieved 1x 105 pack (3 scents), not the 420 as advertised.

The wipes are themelves are as expected. Misleading item title. 1 star for false advertising."	&&&
They are great wipes to take in. I use it in my office since there are so many people around office, I really need useful wipes to keep my things clean. Their flavor is good as well, not too much and just good for me to smell.	&&&
Doesn't hold many wipes and doesn't hold wipes in the packet so they dry out quickly. It is great though for babies so they don't get chilly bots!	&&&
These wipes work great and they were a great deal. They are rather moist, and retain their moisture well, and the most important feature in wipes, is that they don't rip, which these don't. I wish they also came in a smaller size.	&&&
best baby wipes ever .Very thick and only takes a few , I have 3 kids and this is the only brand i trust to get the job done right !	&&&
Works great, I love it. Don't be mean and wipe your baby with cold wipes. Get the BumGenius flannel wipes and this warmer and your baby will stop crying when you change his diaper.	&&&
I'm partial to cucumber scented anything, and these have the performance of the Huggies wipes with the best smell you could ask for! This is my preferred wipe for those little messes in places that might need a refreshing scent- not necessarily a butt, instead the table or little hands when we're out and about. I actually like using these to wipe my own hands down on the go!	&&&
Clorox is a better product then most. I prefer to use Clorox.	&&&
Love ALL Clorox products but the wipes are my favorite!!	&&&
i really like buggies nature care because they are so soft and gentle for my baby ''i can use them wipes almost for everything;love themmmm.	&&&
This wipes come in handy with my 1 year old who thinks it's okay to touch everything with his little hands. Am currently pregnant with a girl hopefully she is not as bad with touching like her brother	&&&
We use Clorox wipes for the whole house. We do wish they were cheaper. So we could save money but we are still willing to get them at the price they are. We love using them here in Oklahoma.	&&&
This product is great when you have small kids in the house	&&&
Great product. Travel wipes are great to keep with you and in your vehicle.	&&&
love the conviences of the wipes....they are awesome	&&&
I only buy Pampers diapers, and I only buy Huggies wipes. These are thick, high quality wipes that you really do use less of and I feel like do the best job at cleaning yucky hineys/faces/sticky fingers/high chairs/your whole house before guests come over/etc... I love the smell and love that it comes with a new dispenser in the box too, because those get thrown around/lost/dirty over time and need to be replaced. I have these on subscribe and save through Amazon Mom and would definitely recommend them.	&&&
Am happy to have these handy for quick cleanups in kitchen and bathroom. It's so easy to keep my bathroom looking "shinny" and to pick up spots and spills from kitchen counter. Kitchen sink still requires a little extra scrubbing at times if I don't keep after the clean-up.	&&&
These wipes are very gentle on the baby and my daughter loves diaper changes now!	&&&
I clean everything with my clorox wipes. Kitchen counters, kitchen table, small spills on the floor. I even use them for dusting. I would be lost if I didn't have clorox wipes in my house at all times.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes they smell goo and leaves the surf clean.	&&&
Really liked these wipes!	&&&
The wipes are effective, but minus one star for the plastic dispenser for the wipes. It is quite flimsy and I'm only on the second package of the wipes and when pulling out the wipes, the top comes off.	&&&
"I have a 25 month old and a three month old, both boys. The first few months of both my boys life, we used Pampers sensitive diapers and sensitive wipes to be most gentle on our new child's sensitive skin. These wipes are very soft and don't wreak of scents or other chemicals. They do a great job at cleaning up the gross baby poo, and protect the parents hands from getting messy in the process. They are thick enough as to not worry about having to tear them, but not too thick to make it hard to get in the chunky little baby folds.

As our son got older, we switched to Natural Care wipes because they feel basically like wet paper towels (softer). We found that as our children got older and their poo got thicker, the sensitive wipes were harder to clean with as they are almost like wet silk - they don't really have any ""gripping"" power. But, for infants these are un-beatable!

The one thing I will say is that when our children had bad diaper rashes, they still cried with these wipes. ... Read more"	&&&
These wipes are ok. Them seem very thin. I would compare them to pampers wipes which I am not a fan off. I am a Huggies fan. They need to be thick. Feel like I have to use a lot to clean up the mess.	&&&
Love these. Bought them to clean....but my girlfriend has been using these as facial wipes as well-- wipes off the makeup very easily.	&&&
We love these wipes. They are strong and get the job done. We haven't had a problem with having a ton pop out like others said, we have experienced them get dry rather quickly compared to other brands so I gave 4 stars, but my husband and I agree these are our favorite wipes. Subscribe and save and having them delivered right to our door just adds to the convenience!	&&&
"AWESOME!!- My family loves the Boude Flushable wipes canisters . They were so easily to installs,I just hung it on your toilet paper holder and I have convenient way to keep flushable wipes right there when we need them. They are Sturdy, attractive container are fully sealed to keep gently scented, hypoallergenic flushable wipes moist and ready to use They are really handy now that we are potty training my Niece’s daughter and I really love that they are flushable wipes. I received.two Boude Flushable Wipes Canisters each with 42 flushable wipes . Which are Quick & Easy to Refills the canisters. My husband wants me to say that he is so Loves for this product. He can never find the flushable wipes and now they are right where he can find them. I'm going to order more for the other bathrooms. Great Product!!
I received this product at a discounted price for my opinion. My opinion is 100% my own"	&&&
I wipe my butt with these.	&&&
I received a sample pack of these in order to provide a review. I am really glad I did because these wipes are great. They are thick enough that they don't fall apart and really get the job done without having to use too many.	&&&
These facial wipes are great for sensitive skin for makeup removal or to refresh your skin. They have a calming effect on sensitive faces and they are luxurious to use. The scent is indulgent and I love it. However, they are a little expensive.	&&&
I use these whenever my little one has a runny nose. They are much better than regular tissues or even hand and face wipes. They seem to really help him breath better and get all the snot out. The only downside is my little one doesn't like when I use them, but really he just doesn't like when I rub his nose with anything.	&&&
"These wipes are better than most in the price range. They are thick and clean well. My son has sensitive skin and did not have any problems with these wipes. I also like to use them as makeup wipes.

On the downside, the tub that came with them is very cheap. The plastic is very thin and the tub did not last long before breaking. I had to use a different wipes tub with these refills. I am only give this product four stars because of the tub, however, the wipes themselves I would give five stars."	&&&
I use these wipes on both my 2 year old and my 2 month old. They are so gentle on the new baby's sensitive skin and there gentle enough to use on my daughters face and hands. They're also thick enough to clean up even the toughest messes .	&&&
Love these wipes	&&&
"I've tried other pacifier wipes which leave a residue on my hands, but Mam's wipes do not. They are easy to use, clean and perfect for on-the-go. Most of all, they are reasonable too! A win for MAM."	&&&
Love keeping the togo in my purse, to use right after leaving the store!	&&&
I like using Clorox wipes a because it is easy to use. I use them a lot in my car. Plus they smell great	&&&
Everything breaks my baby's bottom out but pampers sensitive wipes doesn't they are the only thing we use and love them	&&&
one of my fav products on the market. always a go to for me	&&&
"I got these as a gift and loved them when my 5 month old had her first cold. She doesn't mind me using them to wipe her nose and they don't make her nose and face all red and dry. I like them so much I am still buying them 3 months later!"	&&&
I love these wipes, especially the lemon scent!!! Work great to clean and disinfect	&&&
The wipes come right out of the can, ready to be used. Very so convenient and the greatest stuff ever!!!	&&&
theyre great to have on hand and clean spills and messes from my two young kids and dog.	&&&
I have a ton of kids and this is what I rely on when cleaning up their messes!!!	&&&
I love how convenient the wipes are and they work great!	&&&
i love clorox wipes it cleans up all the messes on my table and countertops	&&&
I enjoy using the wipes for convenience and they are easy to use. we keep a bottle in all bathrooms, and in the kitchen. They are easy for young children to use and much better then using a washcloth dripping with water.	&&&
These are the only wipes for our little one that have not irritated the skin. Very good value for money, too.	&&&
Good	&&&
We used other types of wipes and my child had recurring diaper rashes. We switched to these wipes and my children never had a rash again. The resealable plastic cover could be designed better as it's hard to pull out subsequent wipes as need. But the product is great.	&&&
I buy these for myself. I use the ones with the aloe. They are great to wipe your face and to take makeup off. They leave a clean refreshed feeling. This is a stronger better way than makeup remover pads! If one of my young grandchildren come to visit for the day, I have them readily available!	&&&
We use Pampers diapers but these wipes cannot be beat! They are thicker than the average wipes & smell amazing! We use less of these because each one can handle a much bigger mess than normal wipes.	&&&
Probably my mistake, but I thought I had ordered the flushable wipes. If you want the non-flushable, these are great. The wipes are not very big.	&&&
Thanks Pampers for continuing to keep our babies in mind with superior products.	&&&
I have a problem with scents -- and it seems almost all items I buy have been scented. I do not know why, because we buy special items to smell the way we want and I for one do not want to smell 10 different scents. To me these stink, I do not want my little dog to smell like some lady in the mall. My dog did not like them, he sniffed and turned his head away and tried to get away from me. So I tossed the towel and I'll donate them with other items I've bought that I can't use.	&&&
"I buy a box of these every 6 weeks. I had to buy Targets ""similar"" brand once because I ran out and forgot to make my purchase. Those were awful, thin and scratchy and I immediately wanted to be finished with the pack so I could use the Pampers Sensitive again!
I've also found that Huggies Sensitive are sticky and have some kind of residue on them. These don't have that problem.

I will never use a different wipe. My son has never had a bad rash while using these and they are thick and soft. Perfect for his bottom! I also use these on my 5 year old's face, as well as my own.

These wipes are great!! BUY THEM."	&&&
"I like that they are small and less expensive then baby wipes to use for dirty pacifiers that hit the floor."	&&&
They are great wipes I just don't like that they come in a bag because they dry out faster this way	&&&
No Rinse bathing wipes smell better than the other wipes and are nice and thick. Also non irritating. Highly recommend!	&&&
"These make cleaning thrown toys super easy!"	&&&
Finally, a wipe container that allows just one wipe at a time to come out instead of 50 when you just need 1 to clean up a mess!	&&&
Once again pampers provides a product that is safe and gentle.	&&&
these are great. highly recommend. i will purchase more of them in the future. they fit securely and didn't bother my dog,	&&&
I don't use disinfecting wipes a lot, mostly just for the toilet and for things that get touches a lot when people are sick, but I don't see why I have to spend so much for a little tub. In my experience Kirkland brand wipes are just as good at the competition, and a lot cheaper. I use them to wipe down the toilet when cleaning, and also for door knobs, light switches, remotes, phones etc when someone gets sick in the house. This is a great way to keep viruses contained. The hard part about using any wipe is too keep the surface wet for the length of time specified for disinfecting purposes. Read the label, I think it says you must keep the surface wet for 4 minutes in order to actually kill the germs and viruses, if you do not kill them you are only teaching them to be stronger against the wipe next time.	&&&
Love this product very much. Smells great works great and easy to use. My baby LOVES these!	&&&
These work really well and are reasonably priced! I've recommended them to all the parents in the team whose boys wear rec specs for ball	&&&
I've read some bad reviews about these wipes, and I just don't get it. I have 3 kids, 2 still in diapers, so I consider myself a wipe-ologist. Here's the straight poop: these wipes aren't loaded with nasty chemicals, so they're better for your kids and the environment. But in my book they are way better than any conventional brand.i see complaints that they are took thick, but that's what I like about them. They are almost wet paper towel-like. They are not flimsy, and if you need to wipe up a mess, they stand up to the job. They never give way or fall apart. They are also soft and gentle, with no fake "baby" perfume smell (yuck). And with subscribe and save these are a really great price.	&&&
Packaging what intact and they arrived on time. I believe it was a good price buying in bulk. I purchased these for a baby shower gift for a 3rd child.	&&&
Easy to use, cleans beautifully, light weight, gets into corners. Very happy with this machine.	&&&
Wanted a wet wipe that had a visually appealing container vs the regular style. Wipes seemed to dry out much faster in this type container vs the pop top variety. Wipes that come with have a much stronger scent. After using package I tried to replace with normal pop top type to see if the drying out was based on the wipes or container. It was definitely the container. Will not buy this version again.	&&&
"I purchased these wipes because we have a labrador puppy and keeping her clean can sometimes be a challenge, especially when we are out hiking or at the dog park. My plan was to keep them in the car so we could clean her up a bit before she jumps in. We used the wipes to give our older, less mobile lab a quick wipe down today and he LOVED it. It is nearly impossible to get his 100+ lb frame into the bathtub for a bath, so having this option is terrific. He just thought he was getting extra love and attention, while we were getting a cleaner dog. Our puppy got a wipe down, too. The wipes were easy to use to clean between her paw pads and her ears. The scent is very light, not overpowering at all. My teen said she thought it smelled like dog shampoo, just lighter. The wipes are just moist enough to pick up dirt, but not enough to leave your dog wet. I think I will need a couple more boxes of these wipes!
I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and fair review."	&&&
The natural care wipes were so much better than these, softer.	&&&
Very good multi-surface wipes	&&&
"The SoFetch Natural Cleansing Wipes for pets smell great! The wipes are made with organic and natural extracts which allows me to feel better when using them on my pup...I don't have to worry about any crazy & harsh chemicals affecting her. You can use them anywhere...I'll be buying some for my pup and I recommend you do too.

great wipes!	&&&
I love these wipes, the only kind I will use for my son and my nieces. They are soft, thick and get the job done!	&&&
These are the only wipes I use for my kids because they work great and my kids never have a bad reaction to them.	&&&
This are super moist wipes after wiping down two 7-8 pound dogs the wipe was still moist and could be used more it has a light scent that leaves my dogs smelling clean and fresh these wipes are thick,durable and a bit bigger than a traditional baby wipe.it's made with organic and natural plant extracts that makes it safe for my dogs.They are perfect for touch ups in between baths.*Sample Provided*	&&&
These wipes are smaller than they used to be from the same brand. They shipped from Sam's Club. If you have a Sam's membership, it is probably cheaper to buy from them directly. With postage, it was less than $5 more to order through Amazon and I don't have a Sam's membership. However, I really like these wipes due to the fact that they are individually wrapped so they are easy to throw in a bag and don't dry out. I keep some in each of my purses as well as on my bicycle for when the chain pops off. I like wiping the dirt off my hands instead of smearing it around like with hand sanitizer.	&&&
I really like Clorox Disinfecting Wipes because they are easy to use, convenient, and cleans and disinfects wonderfully. I have to these disinfecting wipes in my home all the time. When I clean, I like to have a product in my home that cleans and disinfects my home, and Clorox products does that.	&&&
My favorite cleaning and disinfecting product! I always have Clorox wipes on hand!	&&&
LOVE THE WIPES they are amazing i use them for everything they come in very handy	&&&
clorox wipes are a great tool to carry when traveling in car or rv. easy clean up and deodorizes and disenfects	&&&
As a working mom, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes make cleaning up on the go a cinch!	&&&
i literally use clorox wipes to clean everything. They should make clorax brand baby wipes!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes instead of dish rags to wipe counter tops without spreading germs.	&&&
Baby fresh wipes not only smell great, but they get the job done right with minimal wipes needed.	&&&
I use the disinfecting wipes everywhere, my room, restroom and kitchen! It gets the job done!	&&&
These really come in handy for me since my new puppy is white. They smell like baby wipes and work just as well. I do not use them on her face though. I am not sure how safe that would be, but they work everywhere else!	&&&
These wipes are a great help around both the home and office. They claen up messes and leave behind a fresh scent."}},	&&&
Yes they were just what I expected and more. They are a very good size for what I use them for.	&&&
These wipes are soft and clean very well without hurting. Packaging is also convenient and easy to carry in cars, bags, strollers, etc. Our child was very sensitive to baby wipes and has done extremely well with these. I would highly recommend.	&&&
"These are just the right size. Just a tad smaller than a handy-wipe.
Do not take up much room so you can carry a bunch in a purse
or pocket. They are alcohol impregnated so I can use them to
cath and swipe before checking blood."	&&&
"These are the only wipes that didn't make our child cry in pain after a while. To me they seemed softer than all the others we tried, plus I think the soap is milder, based on our experience with our son who has very sensitive skin. After 2.5 years, these are still the best we've found.

Make life easier on yourself and become an Amazon Mom and then also enroll in Subscribe and Save, and these will magically show up every month or so at a price that beats Costco and BJs (even after coupons)."	&&&
We had used these in the past and there wasn't this terrible perfume on them. These wipes are now so loaded with perfume that they make me gag when I open them. These are supposed to make you feel clean, not like you've just loaded yourself up with chemicals. Definitely won't be buying again unless they remove the perfume.	&&&
"The wipes have been great for our WPG to help keep her eyes clean and debris free. The wipes are gentle yet durable and suitable to use to clean up your pets. We like them!

I received this product at discount in exchange for a unbiased honest review."	&&&
These are the best wipes, I was using other wipes son got a rash bought these and 2 days rash was gone haven't stopped using these and no more rashes. Wish they sold in store and in big box, but will continue to purchase online. They Are the safest wipes.	&&&
"""I am using it for my newborn child, I love that it keeps my wipes warm enough for him.

I don't have a any bad reviews about it.

We should have more colors available."""	&&&
"These are very handy to take care of those sudden odor problems dogs are fond of acquiring at inconvenient times. They seem to like to roll in things with an odor that is less than appealing to humans. These wipes look and smell like an aloe vera diaper wipe but work well on a dogs fur to get rid of that doggy smell or worse smells they show up at the door with. Great for travel or camping when a bath just isnt an option so you dont have to be stuck with a stinky dog. Very simple to use and you dont end up with a soaking wet dog shaking water everywhere. These could even be used o a cat that may have crawled thru some dusty space and needs a little help cleaning up. Your kitty will thank you to use these vs a shampoo bath. (Your arms will thank you also when you are not dripping blood) Definitely a good thing to keep on hand when you have pets.
(They could even clean up a 2 legged critter in a pinch)

Disclaimer- I did receive a discounted price for this item in return for a completely honest and non biased review of the item. I have no personal connection to the seller and the discount did not influence my review in any way. This is my honest opinion and evaluation of this item."	&&&
"I've always been a fan of Simple products (except their exfoliating wipes. those are super painful.) but I haven't tried this particular line just yet. I'm glad I was able to pick up one through Amazon Vine!

Disclaimer: I don't wear waterproof makeup so I can't say how well this product works for removing that.

But I will say that even with hard-to-remove liquid liner and dark shadows these wipes do a pretty great job at removing most of my makeup. Perhaps it's more of HOW I take off my makeup rather than the wipes fault. I have yet to find out if it's just my technique. Or lack of!

Regardless, these wipes feel nice on my skin. It leaves it hydrated --- as in there isn't a ""tight face"" after feeling when it dries. It also doesn't leave that weird could-be-oil residue on my fingers after I toss the wipe that I hate so much.

If you have really sensitive skin or are just tired of using harsh makeup wipes that leave your face feeling raw after use then I would suggest looking into the Simple line. I have eczema that tends to come out and play the most in the summer and winter and Simple doesn't irritate my skin at all!"	&&&
Best wipes, hands down, thick enough that you don't need 15 to clean up a messy diaper.	&&&
They smell better than other wipes and they get the job done. Until I research what is the least toxic thing to use around the house (probably good old vinegar), this is what I use in the bathroom, in the kitchen, and sometimes for dusting.	&&&
I love these wipes! Very convenient for a busy mom!	&&&
Have tried other brands and do not like the smell of others....love clorox wipes and smell.....	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. I use them for all of my cleaning needs.	&&&
Clorox wipes are very convenient! They are great for cleaning baby and toddler toys. They are also good for disinfecting surfaces. Clorox products are a great product for me and my family.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, they make my life so much easier. I can wipe down all my surfaces in my house and know they are free of bacteria.	&&&
CLEAN REALLY WELL. I LOVE THESE WIPES THEY ARE EASY FOR QUICK CLEANUP AND SMELL GOOD!	&&&
Great wipes to use on most of the surfaces and very effective!	&&&
As a classroom teach, I rely heavily on these wipes to keep the germs safely at bay. At home, I'm not the neatest person around and this helps me clean up spills quickly and with ease!	&&&
We love Boogie wipes! They are gentle on baby's skin and they smell AMAZING! We haven't used the grape scented ones but we love the green ones. They can be used for just about anything!	&&&
If your toddler is anything like mine, he absolutely hates to have his nose wiped , especially when it feels like we are wiping every five minutes! Boogie wipes make it so easy though because they smell so great (especially the grape) he doesn't mind me wiping and it never leaves his nose raw!	&&&
I am in love with the wipes, they are so refreshing . They are very cleansing and especially in those womanly monthly times, make you feel clean. Great product, would definitely recommend them, amazing product. "	&&&
Would not have it any other way!!!!!!!!!!!	&&&
excellent wipes! They are tough enough to stand up to just about anything. They do not irritate my kids. My only complaint is they stick together, so if you use the generic Pampers wipes holder, it can be difficult to get one out, which is frustrating when you have a kicking, screaming kid. we bought a OXO wipes dispenser and it solved that problem.	&&&
These are about $3.00 each in the stores so it's like getting one can for free. I'll buy these as long as they sell them. :)	&&&
These are my husband's favorite wipes because of the scent. He threw away good wipes because these ones came in. He said he won't wipe our baby with anything else. He's silly, but they're hard to find where we live, so it's awesome to be able to get them here. Love love love them! I love the scent and the thickness. Makes cleaning dirty babies a breeze.	&&&
I definitely like these wipes for in-between bathing. My dog loves to be rubbed down with the wipes and she is usually very picky. Makes her smell better also without the scent being overpowering. I'm not sure how clean she actually gets but I can live with that.	&&&
Love, love these wipes. They feel refreshing and have no chemical smells that I've experienced with other baby wipes. I buy them by the case and recommend them to all. I've read some reviews that they felt they needed to use more wipes to get the job done. I haven't had that experience. One or two wipes per diaper change at the most. Highly recommend these for baby.	&&&
these wipes are the best wipes we use them all the time bc our little one is very sensitive	&&&
"I have used Zeiss lens cleaners for many years. Recently, my brother gave me a half of box of his lens wipes. Honestly, I could,not believe the difference.
I really thought most lens cleaners were the same...boy, was I wrong. I went right back to Zeiss. My glasses, ipad, cell phone and all the other items I use these with, look so much cleaner, with no dust, and they have just enough fluid on them.

I will never buy another brand...I love Zeiss....quality..."	&&&
Love this product! I keep the wipes in the car, on my desk, in my kitchen and in the bathroom!	&&&
love pampers wipes---you can't go wrong with any of them!	&&&
Outstanding Product. Using this product has allowed me to replace wiping counter tops with these wipes. I highly recommend this product.	&&&
These wipes are easy, convenient and disinfecting.	&&&
Love these wipes! They are so soft and the perfect size. I make my own wipes solution and they keep in my OXO wipes dispenser quite well. They have washed well with minimal staining. I would definitely purchase more.	&&&
I have 3 children aged 6 and under, what else do I need to say? It seems like I need wipes every time I turn around because they are constantly making messes. Clorox wipes are great for quick clean ups from the dinner table to the counter-tops because who wants to spend a bunch of time cleaning up after dinner?	&&&
Best wipes we've used. Doesn't cause any irritation as we've found with similar wipes of other brands.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! I use them to get the eye crust off my puppy and wipe him down in between baths (I use the same brand and fragrance for shampoo as well). They smell amazing and are thick in comparison to other wipes I have tried.	&&&
I am super excited to use these this winter for my dogs paws walking through any salt that I didn't know was on the street! These wipes have already come in handy on raining days. No more muddy paws on my carpet! They are not overly scented and my dog really doesn't seem to mind me using them on him.	&&&
I love these wipes and have been using them for the past few months. They are not to dry and not too wet. They are just perfect. Very good quality and I will definitively will keep buying these. I feel as if most wipes just dont clean enough, but i've found that the textured pattern of these wipes does a great job.	&&&
"Compared you other mainstream wipe brands these are fabulous! The texture of the wipe is great and assists to get all the junk off your babies little bits, trust me you want the texture. They are soft and I purchased unscented as it's less chemicals to be putting down below. Each package also contains more wipes that leading brands; either that or they are thicker...which both in my mind is better.
I was concerned buying an off brand at first but glad I made the leap of faith because these are better."	&&&
I like this and I only just received it. I have two dogs that are white and get dirty easy from digging. Its easy for me to take these wipes and clean off the dirt patches and their feet for when they come in. It was raining today so it deffinitley came in handy when my dog went potty in the muddy water. It also smells pretty good and seems to be gentle on the paws. I have received this product discounted in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	&&&
I purchased these because they were a great deal. I didn't expect much, but am very pleasantly surprised. They are adequately moist and a medium thickness. The box that came with them was broken by my 11 month old almost immediately, but the wipes themselves are a good product.	&&&
Great wipes, great price and gets the job done!	&&&
They smell wonderful but I have to use three wipes to take off my makeup and even that doesn't remove it all."}	&&&
My dog has severe allergies & very sensitive skin.There are few products on the market that don't irritate him or that he does not have an allergic reaction to.I used the wipes to clean his legs, paws, eyes and belly area. Not only did they smell great, they were very durable and do the job and I was very pleased that he had no reaction to these wipes at all. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has animals with allergies and sensitive skin.	&&&
"These SoFetch natural cleansing wipes for dogs are amazing. When she goes outside she loves to roll around and comes in stinking. Plus when it rains and she gets wet she smells like wet dog. These wipes help fresher her up and also in between bath times. She doesn't seem to mind being rubbed down or bothered by the smell. These smell great too. I will be purchasing more once I get done with these ones. Great product.
I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
I received a sample of these wipes and I honestly can not be more happy. They are great on baby's bottom, face, hands, quick clean up for spills, everything any other brand of wipes can do. But these are better.. They are better for us, for the envioment for everyone. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own	&&&
"I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.

I have 2 dogs that I planned on using these for! one 3lb Chihuahua that sometimes has issues going to the restroom and a 7lb mutt that is very furry and tends to get eye buggers. Since receiving these cleaning wipes I was able to use then for cleansing both issues and they have worked very well.
I have noticed no irritation on either dog and I like that the wipes are without any unpleasant odors.
These have worked well for me and I would recommend them to anyone with dogs that would need a bit of cleaning now and then!"	&&&
I like that these cleaning wipes are all natural. My furbabies are inside dogs so I have very concerned with what that get on their body and keeping them clean. I usually wipe them up after they come in from playing with all natural organic baby wipes. So when I was given the chance to review this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review I was ecstatic. They are gentle to their skin. They are pretty thick not rough and wipes the dirt away easily. There are 20 wipes total, they are biodegrable which is another plus. I will be using these in between their baths. Not for their baths but in between them when I have good intentions to bathe them that night but not able to do so. The smell is nice also so after using them none of them were sneezing and looks like this is a winner no allergies affected. They look and feel just like baby wipes, so nice even a human could probably use them. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review. I like them a lot.	&&&
This wipes, it’s a lot more better than other. The wipes itself was thick and wet. My son has sensitive skin but I have no complains.	&&&
I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I have a dog and whenever she uses the bathroom it gets stuck to her hair and dries up and its just plain gross. In the past I've looked for a solution to this issue . I've tried baby wipes but it didn't do much good. So i thought I'd give this a try .i was very pleased. Not only did they clean her well it left her smelling way better than before. I didn't have to run and give her a bath like i used to in the past. This was a major time savor . These are fantastic!	&&&
Disappointing quality compared to the Huggies I normally buy. These wipes were thin, somewhat dry, and the packages dont re-seal well at all. I bought them meaning to keep in diaper bag, but they didn't really work for that at all.	&&&
I been using different neutrogena make up remover wipes for years and three days ago decided to try this one, but after two days of trying I started to get small spots all over my face. I thought I was breaking out, but it was so abnormal and I realized the only thing I changed recently was my wipes. I was disappointed. It is on the areas I used it on. My forehead, cheeks, and neck. I have stopped using it since yesterday in hopes of the reaction going away, but so far I haven't seen it going away.	&&&
I love these wipes. I use them to wipe makeup off my face, including eye makeup. They are very soft, and moist and work very well. I have used some that just don't work well and seem to just glide across your face. This cloth is more like a real cloth material and is very moist and you can see the makeup come off. Nice big package.	&&&
We love these wipes for everything! They are easy on my kiddos' bottoms and thick and soft. My only complaint is that sometimes the wipes will leave fibers/fuzz behind.I received a sample in exchange for my honest review.	&&&
"I always like to have cleansing wipes on hand for myself and my family, so this idea makes perfect sense to me. Why wouldn't I want special wipes for the very messiest member of the family, my pup? I love that they're natural and organic so I don't have to worry about harsh chemicals on his sensitive skin. I can use them on his face, which is great, because he's a notorious digging maniac and his white fur is often rimmed with grass and dirt stains around the snout. He also has a tendency to find anything smelly outside and just roll in it with a look of pure bliss. No, I don't get it either. But with these wipes I can at least keep the stench down in between his normal bath times!

I have received free products in exchange for my honest thoughts and opinions."	&&&
I absolutely love pampers sensitive wipes. I have used them with all 3 of my children.	&&&
I was skeptical when I found out Amazon was selling baby wipes, but when I saw them on sale I decided to give it a shot. I was shocked at the durability of the wipes. These are definitely comparable to Huggies or Pampers wipes. I will definitely be purchasing them again.	&&&
"I am using it for my newborn child, I love that it keeps my wipes warm enough for him.
I don't have a any bad reviews about it.
We should have more colors available."	&&&
These are excellent jewelry wipes for silver and gold. I use them all the time.	&&&
"This box contains a plastic inner bag that contains the wipes. The wipes have a pleasant smell and feel resembling that of a baby wipe. They are durable and work well for both wiping the dog down or cleaning an oops. I used them for both and on the floor they did not leave any residue and on the dog they left him smelling and looking clean. I used them on a hairless Chinese Crested and it did not bother his skin at all. This is unusual because he has very sensitive skin and no protective fur so it was right on his skin. I like that one wipe was enough for the whole dog and they stay moist for a good amount of time.

I would recommend these for either use and believe they are basically just a baby wipe packaged for your dog. I have used both dog and baby wipes on my dogs and these are actually softer and thicker than most dog wipes that is why I say they seem more like a baby wipe this is not a bad thing at all. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all views in this review are strictly my own and not influenced by this."	&&&
"These have been a godsend in a house where we are helping to take care of an aged relative with limited mobility. She needs help making sure she's clean when using the restroom, so having the convenience of the plastic hanger below the toilet paper holder is an ingenious move. The holder is sturdy and a must-have companion with the wipes.

The wipes themselves have a pleasnt, baby lotion scent, great texture to get maximum cleansing, and the perfect amount of moistness. The size of the wipes are perfect at 20cm x 13cm (about 8x5 inches). They have no alcohol. This is instrumentally important in those caring for aged individuals because these individuals tend to have issues with their skin; the less things irritating the surface of the skin, the better.

The refills packs pop out easily and can be replaced in seconds. The plastic holding case has a lip around the opening for the wipes to keep the refill in place, which was genius product design on their part.

We have a septic tank and good, larger pipes under our house, so while the packages does say ""flushable"" any plumber will tell you to take that with a grain of salt. However, they flush perfectly well in our house, with our plumbing. We got lucky because I'm testing out some septic tank cleaner and pipe/toilet unclogger and on top of that, we just had our septic tank replaced and the access lid is exposed. So I'm 100% sure when I say they flush just fine here.

While I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, I would highly, highly, highly recommend these to any caretaker of an aged or disabled individual, and to any household with younger kids. I even tried the wipes while changing my friend's baby's diaper; they really are gentle, smell amazing, and the Plastic Container for the BouDe wipes is designed perfectly; I have tried a lot of wet wipes for the potty, but this brand is far and away the best one, hands down."	&&&
"I compared these to Target's Home 360 store brand. I like Amazon's way-y-y better. Amazon's wipes are thicker, softer, and less likely to cause a rash. Both brands contain aloe, but maybe this Amazon brand has more aloe. The Home 360 brand caused a rash on occasion. Not a single rash with Amazon Elements. And they are so soft next to skin. Home 360 wipes were not rough, but not particularly soft or pleasant to the touch. Surprisingly, Amazon Elements baby wipes are strong: soft, but strong. They're soft like the so-called flushable wipes (you should never flush ANY wipe), yet strong to prevent accidental tearing.

I also love that these wipes come in a dispenser pack. They cost a couple pennies more that the refill packs, but are more convenient and take up less space on the bathroom counter. And they retain their moisture. With the Home 360 dispenser, the top wipe would often be too dry and I'd have to use two.

Summary:
They are sufficiently large for adult use
They're very soft and pleasant to the touch
They have aloe and don't cause rash
They come in a convenient dispenser pack
The dispenser pack helps the wipes retain their moisture (much better than the Home 360 dispenser does for its wipes)"	&&&
These are great moist wipes that are not just barely wet. They are all natural which is important to me and are prefect straight out of the package they are stored in or in a tub. They separate easily as well making it easy to quickly grab wipes suitable for any emergency situation and you parents know what I'm talking about.	&&&
Clorox wipes are very convenient and can be used on almost any surface. They're great for disinfecting almost everything and can also be taken when traveling. I love Clorox wipes!	&&&
I love these because they are always easy and handy to have around the house, I have a special needs child and I need more than just handy wipes to clean up the messes, and keep germs away. Last thing I need is for anyone to get sick, so these are just great for my home.	&&&
I'm very allergic to even the "sensitive" labeled wipes, I end up getting chemical burns on my fingers, after several different wipes I have tried, I'm not allergic to these. Only downside is the wipes aren't always separated/cut, so when you go to pull out one, you end up with a few.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They are quick and easy to keep on hand. They clean and disinfect when and where you need them. Home, office, or purse. I always have them with me. You never know when you will need to tidy up and freshen an area.	&&&
So far they are great for my granddaughter..she has colitis and developed horrible diaper rash and the regular wipes seemed to worsen the rash..these do not seem to bother her at all	&&&
I have 4 boys, so having Clorox Disinfecting Wipes on hand is a MUST!! Dirty hands, means dirty everything...so I grab my Clorox wipes for most all my cleaning needs!!	&&&
I love this product for my son's nose and face, but it's a lot more expensive than the other brand.	&&&
I like this wipe is good for sensitive skin and wet enough. Yes sometime need to wait a bit to dry off. Never break skin or make baby burn. But the fact that won't dry out after a week not using it at my in law house which we only go visit on weekend is good.	&&&
these are made well but they aren't easy to use. The fabric is folded and slides when I use them to wipe my baby's butt. They are big but because of the sliding factor they are inefficient. I won't be getting them again. They need more friction to do the job easily and efficiently. I bought a lot so I'll be stuck with them for a while unfortunately. My husband hates them and refuses to use them so we ended up buying some wet wipes that are easier to use after all.	&&&
Disappointed the wipes really don't get warm	&&&
Doesn't leave the greasy or dry feeling after use. This left my skin feeling clean. I didnt feel like I had to wash my face after usung it like other most name brand wipes that will leave a filmy residue afterwards. Has a nice clean smell and isn't overdone with fragrance. As far as I know, these aren't sold in the States, so the only bummer is that I have to order them through Amazon and wait for them to arrive after I've ran out. But that's mostly bad planning and preparation on my part.	&&&
Love it! It's the only brand of disinfecting wipes I will use.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best thing to use when cleaning and disinfecting around my home. My kids are constantly spilling or making things a disaster. Clorox wipes are convenient and clean up the mess in a very quickly way.	&&&
I have 2 fussy, wild babies and cleaning their new teeth are always a struggle because they do not want to spend more than 30 seconds doing so. However, they are obsessed with wipes! Even if I leave the baby wipes laying around, they get to them just so they can bite on them. I am guessing it helps with the teething. Anyways, since they already love wipes, they really do not mind these bubble gum flavored ones! Not that they have ever had bubble gum, but it is a pleasant flavor to them. Teeth cleaning is no longer a fuss! i received this at a discounted rat ein exchange for my honest review and opinion.	&&&
It's great that a portion of the purchase goes to helping polar bears, but these wipes definitely didn't live up to the hype and my expectations. I had to use more than one, as others have complained, because the wipes were so dry, and the only good thing was the scent. For what these cost I won't be purchasing again, sorry, polar bears.	&&&
I actually bought these as a gift for someone-all new moms need baby wipes! I asked for her feedback because I had never used this brand before and she said she LOVED them! She said they were amazing and the best ones that they have used. I ordered another package for another baby shower coming up and I feel great about gifting them.	&&&
I love these wipes! They are thick and quilted. Iv had no problem using them on my babies sensitive skin. Plus they are reasonably priced!	&&&
These are very soapy/sudsy! I do not like them at all because they leave such a residue on my baby. Plus, I noticed that after I used them only once, he ended up with a very red bottom because the suds were still on his skin. I used coconut oil on the area and the redness went away. I tried my Honest wipes the next time I changed him and didn't have the same issue. So I tried the Earth's Best wipes again just to make sure and the same redness occurred. I'll be throwing these in the trash!	&&&
We don't have the cleanest dogs in the world, or the nicest car interior, But with some wipes tucked between the seats we can make both a little bit more shiny. These wipes smell good, work well, and are more durable than one would assume from the unassuming box. They twist well to get between toes and really avoid any muck getting into the upholstery. They also mask wet dog smells, but its always a losing battle when its a bit damp outside. They come with an inner baggie but a cheap ziplock can make them a bit faster to deploy and less likely you'll lose some of that great saturated goodness. We received these wonders at a discount in exchange for our honest and unbiased review of them.	&&&
I got these Amazon wipes as part of a special from the infamous Amazon day back in July. I have a brand new nephew and wipes are a welcome gift. I was told they smelled great and worked great! So much so, that my sis-in-law joined Amazon Prime to shop for other Amazon branded items! Good job Amazon!	&&&
Wrapped in a green friendly cardboard box, these wipes come out of the pack easily. Youd be surprised, but I've had to destroy some packages just to use the darn things. The scent is soft and light, the wipes are thick and soft. I use this on my little yorkie after playtime with my big dog. She ends up with slobber stink all-over! Yuck! These help and she thinks she's getting a massage! We live on a dusty property and these are proving helpful for a quick wipe down when they come in from outdoors. I received these at a discount to review with real life pups, and I plan to continue use!	&&&
I love them for my child as well as my whole family.	&&&
Love that these have no smell, don't leave residue, never bothered baby's skin. In fact, I've even used them when I want a travel wipe to freshen up.	&&&
Perfect for everyday use! Also use to wipe hands and face without skin sensitivity!	&&&
These are great. They do a superb job cleaning (we especially use them in the kitchen and bathroom) and disinfecting, and the scent's pleasant too -- not too overpowering, but just enough so it doesn't smell like traditional cleaner. The individual sheets aren't so big they're hard to work with, but not so small you can't get a decent surface area done, either. My only quibble would be that the containers don't keep the wipes from drying out as well as I'd like. They can occasionally be hard to close, and hard to get the sheets to stay in the part where you pull them out. Not that these dry out quickly, but that a more robust container might preserve these even longer.	&&&
This is a huge box of wipes. I wish they were a little bigger in size, but nothing is easier than having it delivered to your door!	&&&
I wear pain patches weekly and at end of week the adhesive is hard to remove! Tried everything these are only things that help!! Will be buying more soon !!!!	&&&
This is a great convenience product to wipe sticky hands and faces. The product has a clean baby scent that lasts for hours.	&&&
Mine arrived frozen and the package was a bent so in turn one of the containers tops will not stay on.	&&&
These are absolutely the best wipes EVER! They are extremely gentle on my baby's bottom and always get the job done.	&&&
Very disappointed, left smudge and lots of lint on monitor. Pull one, whole roll tries to come out. Worked great on my glass touch screen phone and tablet but made LCD monitor look messier. Returned it, buying another brand.	&&&
These diaper wipes are very good for my granddaughter's sensitive skin. Pampers makes a great product. Will definitely order again.	&&&
These wipes work well for diapers size 2 and up. I prefer the sensitive skin wipes on diaper size newborn and 1.	&&&
Lysol wipes in bulk. Great for quick clean up in the kitchen and bathroom. The fiber is stronger than most paper towel and I don't have to deal with a spray bottle and towel. The price on Amazon isn't the best price, but it's a matter of convenience by having it dropped ship to my house.	&&&
"These wipes are great for my little country poodle! I live out in the country and in the humidy muggy state of La.My Poodle loves to run off in the yard with the lab but of course he always finds something nasty to get into! I feel i am always giving him a bath to get the stink out. I was looking for something i could use between baths to freshen him up this do the trick! I love the packaging makes it easy to pull out as the dog comes running thru the door can just grab one real quick and wipe him down. Love the fact it is made from natural stuff makes him not all chemically smelling its a nice fresh smell!

I got this product at a discount from the company and this is 100% my option and i would recommend this product to anyone!"	&&&
"We mostly use these wipes to wipe down our puppies face,ears and eyes in between baths. They are natural and organic and have a pleasant clean smell. The wipes are pretty thick so they get the job done to keep her face clean. She doesn't seem to mind them at all when we are wiping her down either. They work really well but I think they are pricey considering you only get 20 wipes.
I received this product in exchange for my honest review. The fact that they are biodegradable is a plus!"	&&&
I really wanted to love them, but these are the worst wipes i have ever used! Even the dollar store is better! They are not moist enough and have a strange plasticy feel that I dislike. Will not buy again.	&&&
"I don't have any little ones but my husband and I have enjoyed the use of baby wipes before the flushable wipes were invented."	&&&
Absolutely horrible product!!! Does not fit huggies wipes or even the babies r us brand wipes for that matter. When you try pulling any wipes out they either tear into a million pieces or you get 4 or 5 at a time! It also leaks water everywhere from the condensation the wipes make I poured out a whole cup of water from the bottom of it that collected there after a week of using it. I do not recommend this product!!!	&&&
These wipes are great for babies with sensitive skins and gentle on their skins!	&&&
a+ , only problem is I wish the cases of wipes was bigger for each bag, use a bag really quick and would produce less waste if it was bagged in bigger sizes	&&&
Arrived on time. Not as many wipes as I thought there would be.	&&&
These are the wipes you want. They clean well, come out of the package easily, and are a good size.	&&&
I was hesitant to try the Amazon baby wipes, but decided to give them a shot because name brand wipes are just so darn expensive! I have been so pleased with my purchase thus far! The wipes are super soft, and are a great large sized wipe for the tough jobs! They are a great value and are high quality! I withheld 1 star because I wish that the whole for the wipes to dispense was larger! I usually just tear it to make it bigger, but wish I didn't have to!	&&&
I first went on a search finding these wipes after using one to wipe my cart down with at a Whole Foods in Henderson, NV. They should sell these in the store!! First off, I always said Whole Foods must spray something in the entry way to attract customers, but no, it is the aroma of these lavender wipes. If you want a wipe that is highly fragrant, look no further. They are not super wet, but they will get a fair amount of surface wet and hands and face will be no problem to clean. Sometimes I use one to wipe my steering wheel and door handles in my truck. The aroma keeps me smiling all the way to work!	&&&
I absolutely love huggies wipes! They're thick and moist so they get the job done without using more than needed!	&&&
I've wanted something to keep my wipes wet as long as possible. Everything else I've used failed me miserably. I heard about Buti-pods from a FB group I'm in and I decided to give them a try. I am so amazed that they work so well!! They really do keep them wet longer and it's easy to load and dispense! This product seems like they will last a very long time. I can see myself using them long after my baby is out of diapers.	&&&
These wipes are honestly the best quality baby wipes we've found and I love them. They are much thicker and stay moist longer than any other wipes. We used to use pampers wipes until I heard about these and I wouldn't go back for anything and I love the size of the packs too they refill our warmer perfectly.	&&&
I ordered these Cerama Bryte touch up wipes to compliment my CeramaBryte cleaner that I already use on my cooktop. These don't work on bigger messes, but will work fine to touch up the cooktop after meals are made. They don't have the citrus smell to them that the cleaner has though, which is a scent I look forward to each and every time I do my cleaning on my cooktop. These however will wipe up quick messes and leave it looking like you've used the cleaner!	&&&
"Nala is a crazy and active 11 month old puppy. She loves chasing lizards, swimming in the little pond behind our house, running around, playing, giving kisses, and making she she sleeps right next to you. With all of her activity, she often has the wet dog smell. It doesn't help much that we live in a rainy humid climate that makes things worse. I really like these Pet Wipes, so SoFetch. They are durable (just look at her playing with them), and they take away her smell. One wipe will do the job on a small to medium size dog.

I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review"	&&&
"I wear waterproof mascara, so I usually use the Almay Longwear & Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover Pads in conjunction with makeup remover wipes for the rest of my face. I say usually, because these micellar wipes from Simple actually took off my waterproof mascara! I'm still shocked by that because not even my favorite Kirkland wipes do that.

These have no scent whatsoever and there is no sting at all even around the eye area. My skin didn't feel oily or tacky after using these wipes. It honestly feels just like water except it somehow removed every stitch of makeup I was wearing including waterproof mascara (and I didn't have to scrub my eyelashes to death either).

I will absolutely be buying these from now on."	&&&
"I'm always cautious about what products I use around my dogs. I want to make sure that everything is safe and as natural as possible. So when I saw the SoFetch Natural Cleansing wipes I was excited! I've tried wipes in the past that are filled with chemicals and I just don't feel comfortable using those around my ""fur babies"". I'd say I recognize and can pronounce 90% of the ingredients in this product - that's better than some of the foods I eat unfortunately!
Have you ever had those wipes that are just drenched with cleanser so they make more of a mess than help? Well, I have and this is not one of those products. There is just enough moisture to actually cleanse your pet, but not enough to soak them. If I wanted to soak them, I'd give them a bath. This is a quick way to clean some muddy paws or in my one dogs case a not-so-clean behind. The scent is soft, not overpowering and not a fake chemical smell - I don't want my dogs to smell like a cleaning product.
Do my dogs enjoy this product? I can't say yes to that - it's not the fun-est thing for them, but they definitely don't struggle away from these wipes as they have with some stronger scented ones in the past!
I received this product at a discount in exchange for product testing and an honest review."	&&&
wipes are easy and can't live without wipes. these are left in my car at all times	&&&
I love these wipes because they can be used on not only bottoms, but hands and face too. And they smell very nice.	&&&
I used all over the house. They smell good and disinfected everything, specially during cold season.	&&&
We use these wipes on a daily basis and love the peace of mind they give us knowing the germs are gone!	&&&
"Best Wipes ever I love Clorox wipes use it for everything...
I prefer them over lysol wipes"	&&&
My family loves having clorox wipes around, they are convenient and we know they will disinfect properly.ki	&&&
I only buy pampers products but I definitely prefer their sensitive wipes vs. the baby fresh because of how thick they are! When cleaning a messy diaper I feel as though one wipe cleans more and keeps your hands cleaner from little ones mess. They also seem to keep their moisture better, especially when using a wipe warmer. Thanks pampers for making such great products for my little one!	&&&
they are wipes and do the job	&&&
These wipes are my go to cleaning supply. From the bathroom to the car. Love them!!!	&&&
great product. it is the best cleaning wipes available	&&&
"I use Clorox wipes at home and at my
Job as a preschool teacher. Clorox wipes help me fight germs during cold and flu season!"	&&&
I love being rest assured that Clorox wipes will do the job and do it well. I don't love the lemon scent, but other than that, the wipes are great.	&&&
"I love Lysol wipes! They clean everything from my kitchen , kids room, bathroom, etc in a very short time! I also store Lysol wipes in every room so it's there when i need it to clean up fast without a fuss and i love that it reasonbly priced and as a rewards member shipping is always FREE, saving me time and money! #Priceless"	&&&
I like Clorox products & the wipes are very convenient. The sock app, on the other hand, is disgusting.	&&&
I ordered these and found that the packets are very difficult to open. Once you get them open the wipes are great. I have resorted to using a scissor to cut open the packets.	&&&
These are strong, very moist, and come apart better than other brands. I really prefer these wipes above other brands given these qualities.	&&&
These are so great to just keep in the car. They pretty much clean up everything not just noses. My daughter definitely prefers boogie wipes to any other type of wipe or kleenex.	&&&
"I read a lot of reviews claiming these are really thick and strong. I disagree.

They do feel thick, but either the wipes or the box (the plastic container you're refilling) that comes with are poorly constructed, as I tear wipes consistently trying to get them out of their box. Perhaps I should blame the box more than the wipes. Pretty sure I'm going with ""a major chain"" knock-off wipe next time. That's the only brand that I have been consistently pleased with the packaging, although I admit they don't make a scent as unique as cucumber and green tea."	&&&
These wipes are wonderful. This is what I carry in my diaper bag because they are good for many uses, not just diaper changes.	&&&
"This has been the best price and option for our family!
I can have a box delivered each month at a very low cost, saves us time and money!"	&&&
WHEN MY SON WAS BORN 14 YEARS AGO, MYSELF LIKE ALOT OF OTHER NEW MOTHER'S OUT THERE WERE INTRODUCED TO BABY WIPES FOR BABIES. WELL, IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE MY SON WAS POTTY TRAINED AND NO LONGER NEEDED DIAPERS AND WIPES. HOWEVER, I NEVER STOPPED PURCHASING THEM, THEY ARE PART OF MY GROCERY MUST HAVE LIST EVERY SINGLE MONTH. I PURCHASE THESE WIPES AND HAVE THEM IN EVERY BATHROOM WITH A NEAT TYPED NOTE ON TOP SAYING (PLEASE DO NOT FLUSH - WIPES- THEY WILL CLOG UP TOILETS) GUESTS LOVE THEM AS WELL. WE USE THEM TO WIPE OUR DOGGIE'S PRIVATE PARTS AND FEET OFF AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE TO DO THEIR DUTY (THEIR FEET NEVER TOUCH THE FLOOR UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN WIPED OFF WITH A WIPEY). WE USE THEM FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY THING. FROM TAKING OFF MAKE-UP, WIPING UP STICKY SPILLS ON THE FLOOR, WIPING OFF FEET, SWEAT, & UNDER YOUR ARMS AND OTHER BODY PARTS TO FRESHEN UP WHEN YOUR NOT AT HOME AND NEAR A SHOWER OR BATHTUB. I KEEP THEM IN MY CAR AND IN MY HUSBANDS TRUCK. WE USE THEM ALL THE TIME FOR WIPING UP DIRT, LIQUID SPILLS, CRUMBS, THE LIST IS ENDLESS. I ORDER THEM FROM AMAZON.COM, THEY ARRIVE IN NO TIME AND RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR. LOVE THIS PRODUCT, 5 STARS FOR SURE.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are thick, do what they are intended to do, and they don't irritate our daughter. Perfect all the way around.	&&&
Love the display type box, Use these on safety glasses for work as well as some high end sunglasses I own. Fair price as I was paying $5 for a 20 pack of another brand.	&&&
These are great and I keep one container in kitchen and one in each bathroom. Nice to have wipes to keep each room clean. This will definitely be on my "reorder" list!!!	&&&
i have been using these since more than a month.i have extremely sensitive skin.I did not have any reaction with these.My skin does not feel irritated.These wipes take off my make up completely.I use them only for face and not for removing eye make up.I use a toner after removing make up with this and i don't find any trace of makeup on the cotton ball that i use for toner.I use light to medium coverage foundation.Overall a good facial wipe.	&&&
Good wipes! Just be aware these are non re-sealable so you will need a wipe box for these.	&&&
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. These Eye Makeup Remover Wipes are great. When we use them they do not leave any smudges when wiping the makeup off like our last brand did. they are not dry or saturated - perfect moisture so the wetness doesn't sting the eye.	&&&
I received a free sample of the Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes for review. Opinions are 100% my own.We used a couple of the wipes while at a family gathering for cleaning up kids hands, arms, and faces. The wipes held up well, didn't tear apart, and got the kids clean! Pleasant scent. We've also used them for poopy diapers. I usually used two for the job, but sometimes only needed one. Would certainly purchase again!	&&&
I'm the mother of 7 beautiful children and I have always used Huggies for wiping their little bottoms. The wipes are thick, durable, never tear and these are not scented. They work well to clean messy hands and faces too. I've literally tried every wipe on the market and none come close to the quality and durability of Huggies Natural Care.	&&&
They do the job but I'll stick with huggies. One thing I noticed is when the wipes are left in a clsed container near clothes for example a diaper bag everything picks up the scent of pampers wipes. Even snacks :(	&&&
My dog has several allergies so I have to be really careful with what I use to wash him up. He loves being outside and is always getting his paws all dirty. These natural cleansing wipes do a great job of cleaning up his paws. They are strong enough that they do not rip when I am cleaning my big shepherd. Best of all, he has not had any reactions to these wipes. I keep these wipes in my car so that my seats don't get all dirty. The wipes leave a clean scent behind. I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion and review.	&&&
These wipes are great for quick wiping of sticky hands of little people, as well as big people. I keep them handy for grandkids, but also use them for removing make up, and as a quick refresher on hot days. Use them often. Would give them all stars, if they came in other scents. Although the scent they have is ok, not too strong, it's just not one I care for. Not a fan of smell of cucumber, but it's not a strong smell . Much better price then the name brands.	&&&
These wipes are amazing and get all the makeup off. I loved how they didn't irritate my eyes like other wipes have in the past and they became my new favorites. The only thing i didn't like about them is that they are a bit rough, other than that I prefer these wipes now over any other ones I have used. I received this product at a discount for my honest review.	&&&
"Great wipes overall. We usually use the Honest wipes, which are still my favorite, but these comes in a close second.

Cons:
-Dry out quickly both in the plastic package and the plastic container that is provided.
-I found them to be small, in comparison to the Honest wipes, and I have to use 2-3 per dirty diaper as opposed to 1 Honest wipe.

Pros:
- Not too moist. Other brands like Huggies and Pampers wipes are so darn moist they are sopping in my opinion.
-Didn't give my daughter any rash or adverse reaction.
-The pattern and design grab particles on babies bottom well.
-No weird scent.

Overall, a great wipe, especially at the price point."	&&&
I've always used Pampers baby wipes for my kids. the older one is already 7 and she still wants to use these wipes over any other wipes when I tried to switch. The price is very competitive. The thickness and softness make it easy to wipe.	&&&
"I rec'd this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

These wipes work great! Pack comes with 20 wipes i use it on my yorkie that always comes from outside drity i use it on his face and wipe all the yucky stuff off even sometimes nears his eyes gets kinda nasty like dried up tears and this helps it come off easily and wipes off clean leaving a clean scent behind keeps him nice and fresh. Great product!"	&&&
I love how easy it it so clean your kitchen and also taking out the wipes!	&&&
very effective I use it very Often and always buy Clorox wipes for all cleaning.	&&&
Clorox wipes do the job. I feel that using them keeps me and my family healthy by killing germs and bacteria that can make us sick. Using the wipes kills those nasties and really cleans!	&&&
These are not Lysol wipes as pictured the description states Reckitt Benckiser Lemon Lime Disinfect Wipe 81145 1330. Generic wipes....read before you buy peoplem	&&&
We have Clorox wipes on every floor of our house and bathroom. They are easy to use, especially for my 10 year old son so that he is able to pitch in around the house with cleaning.	&&&
Prime example of why we should all read labels more closely. This is supposed to be lemon scented but the derivitive in these wipes is thyme oil - very overpowing, as though i stuffed my face into a thyme garden - you'd think that would be delightful & it is....for the first 2 wipes. I also cannot get the dispenser to work so i have to remove the lid now, each time i need to use one. Save your money, this is a double barrell letdown.	&&&
Lysol wipes are great for everything, clean ups, And the value is good!	&&&
Clorox wipes are the bomb and I can't live life without them	&&&
love disinfecting wipes. Use them at the gym all the time	&&&
I use the wipes to clean EVERYTHING. It's easy to use and leaves everything smelling and looking clean.	&&&
"I love the Clorox wipes! I use them at home and at work! Convenient and cleans
Great!"	&&&
They're soft, and they clean really well. They don't rip like a lot of wipes, and they smell good. (:	&&&
don't really like pampers wipes...I feel like they have to much lotion or stuff in the wipe..I love pampers diapers they are my favorite but I like the Huggies wipes best!	&&&
Love Clorox wipes, the only wipes I trust to keep me and my family healthy.	&&&
We LOVE Clorox wipes!!! We have a family of 6 and this past week 2 of our children and my husband and I were sick and if it weren't for our Clorox I believe ALL of us would have been sick. I used 2 packs of your wipes on everything in the house I honestly believe had I not done that then my mother and oldest daughter would have been sick too Thanks so much for a great easy to use affordable product	&&&
I love the ease of cleaning up messes and knowing I'm disinfecting at the same time. Love Clorox products and I highly recommend the disinfecting wipes.	&&&
It cant get simpler than using disinfecting wipes. As a mom of 2 and a mom to 3 fur babies as well....messes are no problem to clean with these wipes around.	&&&
The wipes always get the job done and one container lasts forever in my house!	&&&
Clorox wipes are a staple in our house. I use them for quick clean-ups and disinfecting, especially in the kitchen. And they have great scents!	&&&
I received a free sample some time ago and I have sensitive skin so I had my doubts about it. Being tired of a shiny face and constantly blotting my face with oil absorbing sheets, I tried Med e Tate. Let me just say that I did not reach for an oil absorbing sheet the whole day! I absolutely love it! You get what you pay for.	&&&
I use this for cleaning everything from Kitchen, Dining Room, Bathroom, Children Car Seats, My childrens walker, swing etc. You can use these for just about anything. I do not recommend using them directly on hands (as a hand wipe). Overall a must have in our home for everyday cleaning and disinfecting. Great buy!	&&&
"I LOVE THESE WIPES! They work perfectly on all of my stainless steel appliances and they are SO EASY to use!! They only leave a greasy feel on your hands, which obviously can easily be washed off :)

I will always buy these!!!"	&&&
love using the clorox wipes because they are easy to use and gets the job done quickly.	&&&
The wipes are OK but too wet to my taste. Also the individual packages are rather long, I prefer square shape.	&&&
Clorox wipes are fantastic! They are very convenient to wipe up smudges from Grandbabies on the glass. I love the disinfectant wipes too to clean toilets and countertops in the bathrooms.	&&&
These are y favorite wipes. They clean up better than others I have tried and are pretty thick, which I like. I also LOVE the way these smell. They seem to smell much more pleasant than other baby wipes but that may just be my opinion. I use them for everything.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes almost everyday. It's important to me to make sure my house is clean and free from as many germs as possible. I love these wipes and would suggest anyone use them if they aren't.	&&&
These a wipes are my new favorite wipes! I was given these wipes for testing purposes and for my honest review and these are awesome! I love the smell! The other wipes are so harsh smelling but these are very refreshing! No chemical smell at all! They are safe enough to wipes your hands off but effective enough to get your house cleaned and sanitized! When you get them, you start it by grabbing the inside wipe and pull, but it seemed not as wet as the outside of the roll, so I flipped it upside down for a bit and let the liquid run all through the wipes! Perfect! Worked like a charm! I highly recommend these and will be purchasing a tub very soon!	&&&
Clorox wipes are convenient and an excellent staple in my house.	&&&
Good wipes that don't bother her skin. They do tear easily, but grip better when cleaning than the pampers wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are my favorite because they are sturdy and smell fresh. These are the only wipes I buy.	&&&
I live Josie Maran, I use the argan oil every day, the body whipped cream everyday, these seemed like the best choice for my face wipes. I need wipes mainly just to remove eye makeup. These burn my eye, my under eye , all around and the sting lasts for several minutes after I had finished. I though maybe it was a fluke, tried again and still the same result..... I need to return these	&&&
I'm 51 years old and have used Clorox since I was a teenager--my mother always used it for washing whites and for disinfecting the bathrooms and kitchen. When the Clorox wipes came out I became a big fan -I use them in the kitchen and bathrooms to clean. it's fast and easy cleanup. Big fan of Clorox .	&&&
Clorox wipes is a convenient, quick, easy way to clean up, although I'm not a big fan of the canisters.	&&&
I clean for a couple of seniors and using Clorox Wipes makes it easier on me and disinfects at the same time. They are the only wipes that I have found that don't leave a film.	&&&
My third brand of wipes....this one is by far the best. Soft as cotton candy!!	&&&
These are great. Wish they removed stains better on countertops though.	&&&
These are great for quick places that hide a lot of germs, door handles, refrigerator door, sinks.	&&&
I love clorox for white clothes and I really love the wipes.	&&&
We use wipes almost everyday for quick bathroom clean ups! Love the product!	&&&
Cleans messy tables and has a good smell. A very good product.	&&&
I like clorox wipes because they are easy to use and i feel like they get everything really clean	&&&
My babys butt is sensitive these are the only ones wipes that do not rash him out. We love them!	&&&
I love the smell of these wipes and they clean very well.	&&&
"Great wipes. I do alot of kitten fostering and kittens always seem to need thier eyes wiped! These wipes are perfect. They are soft, very good size and no harsh chemicals or smells. They are great for both ends of my kittens!
I received this product for my honest opinion and I'm glad I got to try them. I will be buying more in the near future t I take care of my kittens, cats and dogs."	&&&
I've used many different brands of wipes but these are one of my favorites. They are strong, durable, moist enough, soft enough but sensitive and for the price you can't go wrong. My only complaint is that when you try to pull one wipe out you usually get a couple instead.	&&&
I don't know why these wipes are so different from the sensitive ones but these ones just do not work as well. They are not nearly as absorbent as the sensitive wipes are.	&&&
"I received SOFETCH Natural Cleansing Wipes at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.

These wipes come in an extremely convenient packaging for taking your pet wipes on the go; it's a small, re-sealable cardboard box with clear peel and re-seal lining inside which keeps the wipes cold and retains their moisture. On top of that, the wipes have a really nice, clean and subtle smell which isn't too harsh for you or pets. As for the effect of the product, my cats' and pup's coat have never looked shinier, smelled as good, or felt so clean.

When using other wipes, like the pet wipes you can find at WalMart or H-E-B, my cats and dog always end up sneezing or feeling irritated.. but with SOFETCH Wipes, they literally acted like they were at the spa; their eyes were closed, their necks were outstretched, and they looked as if they had a smile on their face!

Honestly, I am never using any wipes again. SOFETCH knows what they're doing when it comes to wipes for pets AND their wipes are made with the minimal ingredients needed to make their product.. meaning, you don't have to worry about your fur baby being bothered by harsh chemicals.

In short, I recommend these wipes to you. I will definitely be buying these wipes again!"	&&&
These are the best wipes on the market! Very soft!	&&&
I like that these wipes are fragrance free and I don't get the same burn I've gotten with other fragranced makeup remover wipes. I do find their "just one swipe" statement to be totally overboard though, as I have to work the same as I have with other makeup wipes to get off my regular, non waterproof mascara. It still takes a good 5-10 wipes to get it all off and I don't wear much makeup besides mascara and bb cream. Afterwards my skin feels fine, not overly dry or scrubbed which is nice. I'd buy these again.	&&&
"Wow these are awesome!

Pros:
* Cleans all surfaces as good as my Clorox wipes (actually, better)
* NO residue! (again, better than Clorox wipes)
* Light lovely smell (same as their laundry detergent)

Cons:
* Setting it up was a bit difficult (explained below)
* Expensive

I'm a new mom and now that my one year old is really starting to get around he's just making all sorts of little messes. I find that I'm having to clean all the surfaces in my house once or twice a day. He has his own little play area with one of those alphabet puzzle mats that he's somehow always making sticky. I really didn't like the idea of using my normal (""green"") household surface cleaners, so I went on a little hunt on Amazon. I love Dreft laundry detergent (it smells so lovely I use it for everyone in the house!), so I figured I'd give this stuff a try. I'm glad I did.

I've been able to clean all surfaces perfectly; I haven't found anything that it couldn't wipe off. Somehow there's no residue! At first it seemed soapy, but once it dried there was no evidence of the wipes. It smells exactly like the detergent which is great because it's a non-offensive and nice scent. My only complaint would be that the initial set-up is pretty annoying. Finding the first wipe to lead through the 'hole' is a total pain in the butt. I ended up having to rip out all the wipes in the center before I was able to finally utilize the grip hole thing. Also, the container arrived without the plastic seal, but thankfully the wipes didn't dry out or leak.

Also, I like these so much I'd love to use them in lieu of Clorox wipes for my entire house, but they're just too expensive. I did see a better deal with Subscribe & Save but unfortunately they won't ship to Hawaii. Hoping I can find them at WalMart!"	&&&
I used to love these wipes, BEFORE they changed them! Why, Earth's Best, why??? Now you're just like all the other brands. Admittedly, I'm happy they added a flip top to each pack. But why change the wipes, too? I used to love how soft and thick they were. Now they're small, thin, rough and dry. Please go back to the old wipes!! Until then, I'll have to look for an alternative :(	&&&
This this the first time not buying Pampers wipes. I am glad I purchased these wipes instead! And, I liked the price!! Keep it up!! I love me some Indy products!!	&&&
Not a pleasant odor. Don't clean it as well as Huggies wipes. I should know I have six children	&&&
These wipes are a mothers best friend! We use these to clean and disinfect all our wonderful childrens dirty, sticky, slimmy handprints they leave on walls, cabinets, tables toys and anything else they can manage to reach!	&&&
These wipes came recommended by a new parent class and we have found them to be great! Nice to know that our baby is not being exposed to too many chemicals too early...we typically go in with a wet cotton ball after the wipes to make sure baby's bottom is extra clean and it's paid off in no diaper rash at all!	&&&
"these are just what we needed
if anyone has a dog with longer hair you will want these
owning a yorkie these a must have, mine doesnt like higher grass to touch her and is a pampered princess so
when so goes out she immediately goes and stands in front of the sink so i can wash her bottom
yes i know pampered and maybe a little spoiled
but instead of rough tissue or paper towels we how use these Sofetch natural cleansing wipes
they are our new go to product
i recieved this item at a discount to give my fair, honest and unbiased review of it"	&&&
"Great product. A must have with a newborn. The cold wipes would make my baby scream. He loves the warmth of the wipes from the wipe warmer."	&&&
"This is a great idea. Men deep down want to be cleaner and not carry order down below. I know guys how would not ever be caught with a pack of baby wipes. So the branding is a good idea this is why I put 5 stars. Plus if number 2 is made and there is no option to shower or bird bath that tush, these really do come in handy.

Now I did read a review that they seem to be a baby wipe after all. I guess so. It is crazy that males have a thing about them to refuse using non male packaged products. This is why companies make a killing off men buy repackaging a simple baby wipe you can get a pack of 80 for as low as $0.99 per pack.

As I said it is a good idea because it may encourage more males to be cleaner, until they realize the savings in using baby wipes. Maybe more males will stop caring how they look using things not packaged manly and start caring more about saving and taking care of themselves better down below.

Besides walking around with a smelly tush on a hot day makes men look way worse rather being caught carrying a pack of baby wipes or dude wipes. Lie say you use baby to clean your hands after eating while on the go. Until then I think these are a great idea for shy men with smelly tush issues."	&&&
"Great for when pumping at work or on the go and need a convenitent way to clean without having to rinse in a sink every time."	&&&
Great wipes to use especially on the go with a toddler.	&&&
These wipes may work to clean your screen, but you'll drive yourself crazy just trying to get them out of the container in one piece. When you feed them into the hole in the lid in order to pull them out one at a time, they rip and each time you have to feed it through again. Very frustrating."}},	&&&
I use these boogie wipes anytime my 3 year old daughter gets a cold. NEVER has it irritated her skin. Helps keep it moist and soft... no irritated nose from constant wiping. She loves the smell and lets me clean/wipe her nose easily (she hates when i use regular tissue. Probably hurts her little nose from constant wiping.	&&&
I have finally found the perfect baby wipes. This aren't too think like Seventh Generation and they are not too wet where you need to ring them first. And the fact that it has natural oils, etc., make it even better. We have been using the for a month now and have not had any irritation. Our kids no longer scream from use of a wipe. I will forever buy these wipes for the whole family!	&&&
I have to admit, I bought these initially as a joke gift for my husband mainly because of the name and description. Little did I know how much he would actually use them. They are a neat freak's fantasy and my guy likes to keep clean. Who wouldn't encourage that?? Sooo when I started seeing the supply dwindling down, naturally I had to order him some more. Both times the product arrived as promised and in good condition. If your guy cares to keep clean, this is an item I would recommend.	&&&
This has been by far the best value for your money when combined with amazons subscribe and save program. Comes well packed and includes a plastic wipe box. As far as the wipes go they stand daily use very well, kids love them and they are also very effective cleaners for washable crayons,markers and other stains.	&&&
These wipes worked really well. They were truly unscented. The top half of the wipes were just the right moisture, the second half of the wipes were dripping wet.	&&&
My 3rd purchase. I love them. Super soft and not dry like lots of other wipes.	&&&
"I was so excited to get a chance to try these wipes! I've been looking to get a pack of cleansing wipes for my Puggle and Pitbull and I came across the SoFetch brand. I was pleasantly surprised at how durable these are and how nice they smell. I also love the fact that these are Natural as we all know our beloved fur babies love to ""clean"" and lick their paws themselves, i feel good that my doggies will not be getting any harmful chemicals into their system. My dogs have allergies so I was worried about these but they didn't have any kinda of reaction to them. I highly recommend these to any animal owner!!!!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion on the product, and was not in any way compensated for my opinion."	&&&
Bought these in the infamous Prime Day sale just to see if I like them - they are great! No weird scent and they are cloth-like (so you can't tear them) vs other cheaper feeling wipes. No rashes or anything and they work well to clean up messes - I am impressed.	&&&
What a great product. These wipes are perfect in everyway possible! I'm very cautious when it comes to buying and trying new products on my pomeranian. He is very sensitive to products containing and perfumes. However I use these to wipe all the eye boogers from his eye area and they do not irritate his skin at all. I love that they come in a cardboard container, it was simple and easy to take the wipes out and throw them in my purse when I'm on the go. Compared to other wipes I've purchased in the past, you have to take individual wipes out and put them in a plastic bag to take with you. What a hassle that can be. The wipes have a great smell also, but not too overwhelming. All in all these are great wipes and I've already recommended them to friends and family members with pets. This is definitely a brand I trust to use on my furry friend.	&&&
I really like the idea of these pouches - it has the easy open cap and a ziplock top so I can refill it with more wipes. The problem is that often the plastic cap falls off before I have even used the wipes that came in it and the wipes dry out. I wish the plastic cap was more securely attached.	&&&
"Lysol wipes are the best disinfectant wipes around. I have tried to use cheaper generic wipes to save a few bucks but I always go thru them twice as fast. In a nutshell I always seem to have to use two or three of the cheaper wipes in oder to accomplish what I do with one single Lysol wipe."	&&&
These wipes are super soft and twice the size of what I am use to using. They work surprisingly well. I love that they don't look like baby wipes as I use them for a lot of things! I highly recommend them! Thanks for letting me try them out!	&&&
Love the handy clorox wipes. They keep the desk in my classroom clean and germ free	&&&
We use Clorox wipes in place of paper towels in many instances. Clorox wipes are also a fast, convenient way for quick mid-week cleaning of bathrooms.	&&&
LOVE these little guys! I'm not the best about washing my face with soap and water at night but these are perfect for taking your makeup off before bed. Unlike a lot of wipes out there these have a lot cleansing product on them so you don't just feel like you're wiping your face with a tissue. Doesn't dry your skin out and gets even waterproof eye makeup off!	&&&
"I bought these wipes to clean my baby. I don't like regular wipes because of the chemicals so I use these with water.
These wipes are good and but I think they are very large, I could cut them in half but it would be a lot of work.
I much rather use these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHBGGK/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 instead."	&&&
A dry, A wet, A dry, at least that is what the Cottonelle girl says when talking about bums, I've used these for years, not only good for babies	&&&
in the right light, the screen still looks streaky,but much better than with other products I've used	&&&
One and done is a perfect name for these wipes! We've tried others and we stopped because these are the best hands down!	&&&
We don't have a baby but use the flushable whips in our bathroom. They usually come in a flimsy containers that makes them dry up before all are used. Saw this and thought perfect....and it is. Sturdy, easy to pull out one at a time, even without holding the box, and the whips stay moist till the end.	&&&
Loves pampers sentive wipes they are very thick gentle and smell real good I highly recommend for newborns.... thanks wal-mart for having such a good value quality and price!	&&&
Being able to buy the wipes in bulk is great. Less trips to the store as we use a lot of them. They are soft and very absorbent, leaves baby clean and smelling so nice.	&&&
great wipes but my child became sensitive so we had to switch to the sensitive brand.	&&&
These wipes are awesome during cold season. They disinfect, and they smell good. I recommend."}}];	&&&
I really love when I need to clean up a small litlle mess that I like to grab a can of clorox wipes to take care of the spot.	&&&
There are different disinfectant wipes out there but Clorox Wipes are the thickest and clean the best!	&&&
using Clorox wipes is fast easy and affordable! They are good quality wipes.	&&&
"My company does fingerprinting for TSA and GBI ,so we uses a lots of cleaning wipes for dry fingerprint tips and getting ink off the hands . We do daily cleaning in areas of the office and found Sustainable Earth By Staples does a great job and beside less expense . The clearing wipes do a great job. I have also bought the SPRAY CLEANER , TISSUE PAPER and PAPER TOWELS . LOVE THE PRODUCTS, Thanks Staples"	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because they are easy to use and is a great disinfectant. makes cleanups a breeze	&&&
Simple, easy to use, convenient for quick clean-ups.	&&&
I love clorox disinfecting wipes and the bleach!!!	&&&
The wipes are not only good at disinfecting but have a pleasant lemon citrus odor - and they are super convenient to use.	&&&
"I was very happy with the #softy Sanitizing Wipes, I am always needing to sanitize my hands, being the owner of a wrecker service and having a 2 year old, there are always germs around me and my son. I love how they are very thick, and they don't dry out my or my son's hands, since there is no alcohol in them.

I carry them around with me in my son's diaper bag, so that no matter where we are, they are always close at hand.

If you have a child, or just don't like germs in general, I highly recommend that you try out the #softy Sanitizing Wipes.

Disclosure: I received product(s) in exchange for an honest review, which may differ from yours. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I used personally"	&&&
These moist wipes clean my glasses better than any cloth I have ever used. Each moist rag is packaged individually, so they cannot dry out. They are disposable. So you will have to keep buying them at $14.99 per 200 ct. I have yet to see how long my 200 ct. box will last. Therefore I too wait to see if I feel they are with every penny.	&&&
"I wish packaging could be changed so that outside surface doesn't become moist when pulling out a wipe, because it is then difficult to re-seal without having to dry package with a towel/TP. I've had this happen multiple times. While this product is extremely effective, soothing, and smells very nice, I don't want it all over the inside of my purse!"	&&&
My kids have bad allergies, so I keep these around all the time. I like them because they don't dry my kids noses out and they smell great. My kids still don't love to have their noses wiped, but this makes it better"	&&&
We love them. They are quick, handy and hardly take up any room in her diaper bag. They leave binkies feeling fresh & clean without leaving behind any residue. Our binkie wipes are constantly saving the day! These are a great thing to throw in with a shower gift as they are one of many little convenience items that are often overlooked!	&&&
This will be short and sweet. I absolutely love these wipes and I'm comparing them to Earthbath wipes. I figured I'd try the other competition, but I will not do that again. Perfect coat wipes,like it's shampoo, provides a quick refresher for when my puppy goes out and does his business. It's wet enough so I can clean off dirt and bodily mess. And the smell is perfect for my little one. Compared to Earthbath wipes, it leaves our puppy smelling fresh every time. Not the typical overwhelming baby powder smell.	&&&
I tried these wipes due to a good deal that Amazon offered on them. They are great and very comparable to the Target brand I normally use. I actually prefer these better! and a plus is the packages are really cute :)	&&&
These wipes are a great value. They could meet or beat the quality of the national brands. They are not just for babies. They are good for that extra clean and fresh feeling for any age person. Carry them in your camper or car for your hands after shopping or filling your gas tank. Highly recommend!	&&&
Not bad, great for the Prime day deal, but on regular day prices, I have other wipes I like better.	&&&
"I love the way they clean up the eyes on my two small dogs, They do not mind and it must be soothing to the corner of the eye.

I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
I normally cloth diaper and use cloth wipes but we had a week of camping with no water so I bought these wipes. They have a weird smell that doesn't smell healthy or sensitive to me. Not my favorite disposable wipes.	&&&
"The wipes were not moist at all and therefore did not serve their purpose.
The container did not seem to have been open upon arrival yet the wipes were not moist. I dabbed one in water and tried it out but the my screen was left streaky which was a distracting annoyance.

I would not recommend."	&&&
"I switched from Huggies Natural Care wipes to Pampers Natural Clean Wipes only because the Pampers come in a larger quantity. The Huggies only have about 700 in them, and I couldn't make it all the way to my next Subscribe and Save delivery without running to the grocery store to buy a few extra. Since the Pampers have over 800, I thought it would be the perfect size for a 2-month supply of wipes.

After using 2 packs of the Pampers wipes, I'm ready to be out of them. They're seem to be a lot wetter than the Huggies version, and also much much thinner. When using them, they are so wet that they slip very easily. They are so thin, I feel like I have to use a lot more than I did with Huggies.

They are perfume-free, and my daughter has not had any rashes or reactions to them. I will continue to use what I have, but I may switch back to the Huggies.

I thought I would like that Pampers divides the quantity up into smaller packaging, so that you can just open a pack, throw them in the tub and be done. But, I think it just creates more waste, and I have a ton of small wipe packages that won't stay stacked up well. Huggies wipes came in resealable bags and I never had a problem with them drying out. After having both, I think I prefer the Huggies way just from a less-waste, easier-storage perspective."	&&&
"I have been using these wipes since my first kid was born. Now, I have three, and my youngest is a year old. My wife and I have used other wipes, but it gave my kids rashes. These sensitive wipes have not given my kids rashes.

These are nice thick wraps. All the wipes I have used with my 3 kids have not torn like other cheapies or brands. These wipes has handled
the most disastrous diapers with no problems. Seriously.

As others has stated, these doesn't come with a tub which is a mistake. The only negative about these wipes that they contain a piece of plastic to cover your package once opened. It doesn't have the hard container cover. The plastic cover can break and it has on me which dried out some of the diaper wipes."	&&&
"These are great wipes for my potty trained toddler. I love that they are flushable and they are also very gentle on sensitive skin. I've tried other brands and they irritated her skin. They are good quality and a good size, unlike any others I have tried. They have become difficult to find so I'm glad I was able to buy them here. When I did, I was sure to stock up!"	&&&
"Sofetch are natural cleansing wipes with organic extracts. This set includes 20 wipes that are 8"" x 8"". They are 100% biodegradable, recyclable and compostable. They are not flushable. They are cruelty free and ultra soft. These wipes are free of alcohol, paraben preservatives, petrochemicals, soap and sulfates. My Yorkie-poo even lets we wipe by his eyes with these and he doesn't let me wipes his eyes ever!! He seemed relaxed and just fine with me using them to clean his face!! These wipes come in a great aloe ocean sent and are perfect for your pet!

* I received these for testing and review."	&&&
Favorite wipes by far. I love how you can reclose the adhesive on them so you can take them to go (in the diaper bag) or use them as refills for your home despenser. We tried more inexpensive brands and even the regular Pampers wipes, but the texture of these wipes is second to none and doesn't irratate my baby's sensitive skin.	&&&
We have honestly used about every brand of wipe there is and always came back to these. The sensitive wipes were what we were provided with in the hospital. They are the only ones that don't make him break out and they're not scented which is good to me. Won't buy anything else!	&&&
Prefer these to the Bausch & Lomb wipes. They stay wet longer and clean very well. Sometimes too wet but clears up quickly and well.	&&&
I would expect cheap wipes to be like these ones. They would tear easy and were too soapy. Not the worst wipes, but for huggies, a little disappointing.	&&&
I love how thick yet gentle these wipes are. They're sensitive enough to use on my newborn yet strong enough for cleaning up my toddler after she has a lolly. They're plenty thick enough that you don't be to worry about the bad poops to get on your hands during diaper changes. Also like that the wipe packs have the hard plastic opening as it reseals so well to keep the wipes wet after opening and the containers are durable enough to go through a lot of man-handling between the diaper bag and my older girls (2 & 4). My favorite brand of wipes.	&&&
"I'm always dropping her paci, so I love having these wipes around when I can't boil her paci again. Plus I think they smell good lol"	&&&
I received this in exchange for a honest unbiased review. I have to say these come in handy and work very well. If I had to give my dog a bath everytime he got dirty my water bill would be in the hundreds. Haha but I don't have to because of these amazing life saving wipes. I let him run around the yard and used these today to wipe off what I could spot on him as well as his feet, to my surprise they work very well and I love these plus they have a cleanly scent which makes them so much better. The shipping is fast and the package is handled with care.	&&&
not bad but not the greatest either. cant compare to huggies wipes but is about the same as some other generics. (better than the dollar store brand, about the same as kroger brand)	&&&
I was super excited to have the chance to purchase these wipes at a reduced rate in exchange for my original, honest and unbiased review. I have a wonderful little Yorkie named Princess, who spends her outside time rolling around in the dirt and leaves now that the seasons are changing. As an inside dog, she brings in dirt and dust from her outside adventures. I have had the chance to try out these all natural cleansing wipes and I must say that I am impressed. Her nasty eye boogies and dirt is easily removed and I am left with a clean and fresh smelling doggie. I was worried that the texture would be too thin to provide any cleaning any benefit, but the sheets are super thick. I was also worried that there would not be enough product on the wipe to do any benefit cleansing wise, but I have found that not only are the wipes thick enough to clean her but they are also wet enough to get a good wipe down.Tthey are biodegradable too! I am getting a clean puppy and not hurting the environment! When she birthed her 2 puppies these wipes came in handy to help me with the clean up job on mama!! I highly recommend these neutral cleansing wipes all of the doggie parents!	&&&
"I am so glad I found these cleansing wipes! I have a cat with medium to long hair, and he struggles to get himself completely clean all the time. These are a life saver! So easy to use and they work great!

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
I love these wipes.	&&&
"I absolutely LOVE these pet wipes! We just recently got a 9 month old lab puppy from the shelter and now everything with our normal routine is in complete upheaval! But, I wouldn't have it any other way! However, the time I can dedicate to spoiling my older two dogs has decreased a bit. Trying to bathe 2 dogs was a challenge. Bathing 3 is almost impossible! LOL These wipes are great because I can easily wipe them down when a full bath isn't really necessary. I have an English Bulldog that does nothing but lay in the dirt! I can bathe her and 10 minutes later she looks like she hasn't been bathed in months! If you pat her a poof of dirt comes out of her fur! Yuck!! These wipes are awesome because I can quickly wipe her down and cut down on the dirt she brings into the house. She likes them because she HATES taking a bath! They have a nice scent to them but it isn't super overpowering which is nice. My Shih Tzu likes the wipes too because she hates getting her face cleaned in a bath. These wipes are great and make it super easy to clean off her face. It's amazing once you use them and see how much dirt and grime really comes off! If you have pets then these pet wipes are a must! They have made life so much easier on me and my water bill!! :)

SoFetch Natural Cleansing wipes are great for traveling with younger pets! I've used this product on foster kittens and puppies, to clean them up after meals, when they are too young to clean themselves up effectively. It works great from nose-to-tail. These have a pleasant smell and are also great for when my older dogs gets when he get his paws dirty or something on his coat. These wipes are similar to baby wipes -- disposable and for messy jobs! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and I'm glad that I did. Pets can messy, but these wipes can touch up your dog or cat easily!	&&&
Love the Clorox products. I have 2 kids and a dog. Always needing to make sure the house is clean!	&&&
I love these wipes. They are the only ones I use. It is very easy and I like knowing that it disinfects.	&&&
Only wipes i use on my daughter. They are gentle and do not hurt her sensitive skin!	&&&
These are a must household item! They are so gentle on little noses. You know when you wipe a child/babies nose so much it starts to hurt? Thats why you should use boogie wipes. They are saline infused so they wipe while being soothing.	&&&
I've tried a few other brands, but I like these the best because the wipes themselves are very strong. They are large, and have just the right texture to have the poop cling to them yet feel soft on the skin. Some of the other brand end up feeling thin and slippery compared to these. You don't need to use a dozen to clean up after a poop, if you strategize you can get by with just 3 or 4. The only downer is the packages are sometimes a little crooked which means they don't always work well in the heated wipe containers. But I still prefer these.	&&&
These wipes were below average for me. I received them free as a sample which I am happy because I would have regretted spending money on them. They removed hardly any makeup. I noticed nothing with oil balancing. These were very disappointing. If you just need a wipe to use after using a makeup remover more as a finishing wipe then these might work for you but they are by no means a makeup removing wipe and not sure they even work with oil control.	&&&
"These are great for me when I am too lazy to fully wash face. Also great post workout. They remove dirt and makeup very easily.

My skin tends to break out and I have had no issue with these. If anything they improved skin.

I also use the simple foaming face wash and it is incredible. I am becoming a big fan of this brand."	&&&
I'm giving them 3 stars for good price, pleasant scents, and the fact that they do a basic job of cleaning and disinfecting and I can wipe a fairly large area before they dry out (I mainly use them at work on Fridays to disinfect my desk, computer, and phone, and I can do the whole job with one or two wipes). They lose 2 stars because they leave a FILMY RESIDUE. Which is why I mainly use them at work. Other than quick cleanups between "real" cleanings at home, there aren't many places where I can use these wipes due to the unsightly streaks they leave behind. I'm going to continue using them wherever I can until they're gone, and I probably won't buy them again.	&&&
Great wipes! These have a refreshing scent, hypoallergenic, and strong. These wipes are very strong and at the same time the most gentle wipes. Other wipes that claim to be strong are rough and still tear very easily. Also love the clean fresh scent.	&&&
Great product for an awesome price. We hardly ever have to buy wipes with this deal and the Pampers Sensitive work very well for our little guy :) No diaper rash!	&&&
Cleans good. Price is good comparatively. Wipes are wet when opened	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. Not only do i use them at my home but working as a reading teacher and seeing over 45 students a day i am always wiping my classroom tables down with them. I can't imagine a world without Clorox wipes.	&&&
Love me some clorox wipes. They clean, disinfect and smell good too. Is there nothing they can't do!?	&&&
I love the Clorox disinfecting wipes easy quick use.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes wipes they are so easy to use and convenient.	&&&
I have a love/hate relationship with these wipes. I love how thick they are and they have just the perfect amount of wetness to clean my little girl perfectly. However, these wipes fall apart, and not only when you pull them out of the packaging, but when you're using them on your little one too. Please Huggies, I hate having to buy pampers/off brand, please make your wipes a little more durable!	&&&
These wipes are terrific for cleaning anything and everything.	&&&
I absolutely LOVE the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. I use them on everything!!!	&&&
Great product and decent buy. Same as the lysol wipes you usually get at the super market. Packaging is not quit as fancy but you arent buying these for the packaging."}},	&&&
"I have to say that with having a toddler in the house I LOVE these! They are great for cleaning up sticky fingers, and are really soft to the touch. It was really easy to get the wipes ready to use the first time too. Just had to take the top off and pull the first wipe from the middle of the roll, and push through hole in the top. Close the lid and you're ready to go. Another perk is they have a citrus smell, and they don't leave a chemical smell behind either.

I will say the container is a lot bigger than I thought it would be for me to do my review, but that has actually been nice because it makes it easy to find."	&&&
Love love love these. They are a bit overpriced on Amazon but I can never get them in-stock locally. I love using these to clean up my hands in public. I can't stand to use that gel stuff without wiping my hands thoroughly with these wipes.	&&&
The scent from the wipes is very nice and not overpowering. I loved that the wipes were very resistant and on the larger side. Nothing I hate more than a tiny little wipe. We have used the wipes for our kitchen countertops, pet messes, cleaning after bike mechanics, and mud scuff marks. Every single time they have done an outstanding job. Mike has asked me to make sure and reorder when these run out. Another added benefit is that the lack of alcohol ensures your hands are nice and soft, hence the name of the brand. Definitely a hit in this house!	&&&
"I'm very allergic to even the "sensitive" labeled wipes, I end up getting chemical burns on my fingers, after several different wipes I have tried, I'm not allergic to these. Only downside is the wipes aren't always separated/cut, so when you go to pull out one, you end up with a few."	&&&
I have to admit, I am in love with Clorox wipes. I use them daily to clean up spills in the kitchen, globs of solidified toothpaste in the bathroom sinks, and numerous other jobs around the house. I even keep a canister in my car so when the kids get sticky messes or spilled drinks in my cup holders, I can easily wipe them clean. I've tried other brands of cleaning wipes, but Clorox cuts through the grease and grime much better than the rest of the items on the shelf. Try them, you'll love them!	&&&
Great Product! We love using the wipes to clean and disinfect our kitchen counter tops. It smells so refreshing to! We feel that we get our money worth when we purchase and use the Clorox wipes.	&&&
I buy this stuff for my son's daycare. They use them in between meals to wipe down the high chairs. It really cleans and disinfects! Love these!	&&&
Quick and easy clean up that you can throw out when you're done!	&&&
"This product is not worth the hassle. It has to be plugged in to work. In order for this product to be worth what it costs it should take batteries along with the plug ins. When you are on the go you don't necessarily have a way to plug this unit in to make the wipes warm. Not a user friendly product."	&&&
I purchased these wipes in hopes for a quick clean up for my king charles cavalier...They work great!!! Every time my sweet puppy eats, His ears seem to join in and end up so messy! They are super convenient and not to mention smell great! Just a quick rub down with one wipe for both ears and he's ready to play again without the stinky, snarly ears. Love the fact that they are organic with natural extracts, The resealable top so they don't dry out and they were so quick to arrive! I purchased this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review. My review is solely based on my experience with the product.	&&&
The wipes aren't scented. But it still works.	&&&
Love, love, love these safe and natural doggy cleansing wipes. I have a 6 year old boxer who is a drooler and always wakes up with gooey eyes. I just recently ran across this product and have begun using it to clean near her eyes and wipe her face. Did I say I love these?!?!? I received this product in exchange for a review.	&&&
it was a nice pleasant smell, cleans my old kitties butt nicely when he has issues cleaning himself after going potty. just like baby wipes for your pet :) every pet mommy/daddy should have some.i received this item at a discount for my honest unbiased review.	&&&
I don't know why these wipes are so different from the sensitive ones but these ones just do not work as well. They are not nearly as absorbent as the sensitive wipes are.	&&&
Great wipes. I love the texture on one side, it really helps scrub when other similar wipes don't.	&&&
I bought this because it was on sale & really cheap after discount. Honestly I expect much more from Amazon products but these wipes are very rough on skin. I tried not to use them for diapering purposes. Probably best for wiping hands or cleaning up stuff. It doesn't tear easily, which is good but it's not as moist as other brands' wipes & dried up faster too. Hope they'll improve the quality	&&&
Extra roomy for cloth reusable wipes. Very nice product. Bought as a gift. Want one myself!	&&&
I love everything about these wipes except the fact that they leave behind these little strands of lint from the wipes on my sons bottom. I still love them, but I have to pick around his area for strands after I wipe him clean.	&&&
When my male Bichon started marking at his grooming salon I looked for male wraps . I love these Wiki Wags male dog wraps. They fit snug with two tape tabs and are very absorbent. They also comes with Aloe wet wipes very satisfied with this product	&&&
These wipes get rid of any odor, absolutely amazing! I love using these on my kids, as they just neutralize their natural baby odors. I love them, and the price is just awesome! Thank you!	&&&
Much better price than I have seen at stores and perfect for quickly cleaning off tables and countertops. My only complaint is that my wife steals them to keep her 1st grade classroom clean.	&&&
This replaced my original Floormate that lasted for 10 years. It cleans very well and it leaves the floor completely dry. Next to cleaning the floor by hand, I don't think anything else works better.	&&&
Best makeup remover ever! A must have ladies. Skin feels rejuvenated and fresh for the next morning's makeup. A great price too!	&&&
I love these wipes! These are the only wipes that don't leave a smell behind. My daughter has sensitive skin and these wipes are great.	&&&
The wipes themselves are great but we were disappointed that the tops were not sealed and the box had no right side up markers. When we received it, the solution had leaked out of the canisters and into the cardboard box. Hopefully they don't dry up too fast on us because they lost so much liquid.	&&&
I don't typically purchase Pampers wipes, but these were on sale so I gave them a try. I'll be sticking with my Huggies Simply Clean from here on out. These are slippery and fold up on themselves while wiping, which means I'm always in danger of touching the poo. Nasty! Also, they leave my hands feeling slippery and filmy as well.	&&&
My daughter uses these wipes to clean her Shih Tzu's eyes and ears. These wipes have a pleasant scent and the dog seems to like them too. It does a great job in cleaning him up and making him smell nice. These wipes are moist and sturdy. They are actually thicker than the one I got from the store. The wipes come in a little box that you can take with you in your purse or doggie bag :D I love the fact that these are made from organic and natural ingredients that are safe for our little buddies/family pets. Since my little daughter is using this on her pet, this makes it even more important that there are no harsh chemicals in this product. I did get this product at a discount, but my review is honest and unbiased.	&&&
I have a little pom who loves to get into everything. These Sofetch wipes work a lot better then i thought they would . It has a nice fresh scent and cleaning my little long haired princess is easy and convenient. Having pets is pretty much like haveing children so its always good to be ready for anything. This is a nice easy way to keep them clean top and bottom without having to give a bath each and everytime. I would have to give this product an A+ in all area. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for a fair and honest review.	&&&
"I've been using these wipes since my kids were born that are now four. Me and my husband use them as well. We have them in every bathroom. They are reasonably priced and have no harsh or harmful ingredients. I've never had a problem with reaction or irritation whatsoever. I used the "sensitive" when they were first born and still use them as a carry pack as they have the plastic flip open and close. They are on the very wet side, but not a big deal. Plus, it's better than drying out. Great wipes! Great line!"	&&&
I really like the texture and softness of the wipes. They also were very effective and got the job done without all the harsh chemicals. I will defiantly use again! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
These wipes have become a permanent rotation in our pet grooming routine for our two large breed dogs. Since they spend much of their time outside, they often find themselves getting into stinky things. And while they absolutely LOVE rolling around in gross unidentifiables, it is less than fun for me as a pet owner when they come inside. These wipes are the medium between baths for us. They are great for a quick wipe down and even better is the fact that I don't have to worry about them leaking like I do with the bath shampoo so they are easy to toss in a bag and go. I also really enjoy that I can take the dogs swimming or to a park and am able to keep these wipes handy with me or in the car ready to wipe them down before letting back into the car for the ride home. While I did receive these wipes at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, these they truly warrant a five star review because of how easy they have made keeping my furbabies clean between baths.	&&&
My granddaughter is now one month old. We use Pampers wipes, about eight times a day still. She hasn't gotten a rash and they keep her smelling fresh & clean	&&&
These wipes were a really great value! I got a box a few months ago and am still using them! They don't smell chemically like a lot of the name brands and kiddo doesn't mind them. Good deal!	&&&
I love the price and the wipes but the opening keeps coming off the package. Then they dry out. I guess it is because I am opening and closing with one hand but I need to change the baby.	&&&
"~~~ I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review ~~~

Well I'm very pleased with these wipes..they work very well for what they were intended for...

They can also be used by the owner after filling the doggie bag..."	&&&
Awesome wipes	&&&
So far the best wipes out there since it is basically water. If you look at the other wipes out there they are filed with chemicals. I wanted to just use water which I actually do at home. I use a cotton pad and dip it in a bowl of water but when I'm traveling I use these. The only improvement is if they could fix how these wipes come out. You need both hands to yank the wipes out they aren't easy to yank out with one hand.	&&&
These wipes are great! I always use pampers wipes and diapers and I have no issues with rashes or leaks.	&&&
I bought this product thinking that it would be amazing to take off my longwear lippies/stains. I gave it 3 stars because it does smell great, I like the little mirror and the packaging. It smells like melon to me. They are wet wipes, a bit bigger than your lips. Makeup removing wipes work better!	&&&
I love this product because it is so easy and convenient.	&&&
I love my Clorox wipes. We have them in almost every single room of the house. The wipes are convenient and very easy for even my little ones to use especially right now with everyone getting sick.	&&&
We love Clorox wipes because they are convenient, they wipe out the germs and disinfect the entire house! Great for little fingerprints and quick clean up on messes!!	&&&
We are happy with this purchase. We have yet to finish the case of wipes. I heavily suggest making sure you have purchased the wipes in the container these are replacements for, otherwise the wipes dry out quickly if you just use them as they are.	&&&
These wipes are very effective and inexpensive. I use them throughout my household. The scent is soft, yet refreshing. I also use the travel, on the go wipes for my car, and when I'm out in public.	&&&
"Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are so convenient and easy to use.
I like how they disinfect and whiten."	&&&
"Great for quick wipes of hands and face. It smells terrific!!!"	&&&
I like this product. I use it to disinfect and clean my bathroom.	&&&
OTHER WIPES IRRITATE MY BABY'S SKIN BUT THIS IS PERFECT.	&&&
"I am always on the lookout for sensitive baby wipes. There is nothing sensitive about Pampers Sensitive Wipes.

What I like:
Size - the size of the wipes is a little over 7"" square when unfolded. They are perfect for large, messy jobs

Texture - the texture of the wipe is very soft, and feels silky against your skin

Doesn't leave residue - these wipes don't leave a film or residue after wiping, unlike other brands of wipes that always leave a residue behind

What I don't like:
Causes itchiness - these wipes always cause itchiness in sensitive areas after using them, even though they are marked as sensitive

Ingredients that cause irritation - these wipes contain multiple ingredients that can irritate your skin. I've listed those ingredients below.

The ingredients that can cause irritation are:
Glycerin - is essentially an alcohol based product; I don't recommend using it on sensitive areas, and it always leaves redness behind on my skin

PEG 40 Castor Oil - does not irritate skin, but it can increase your reaction to other irritants, I've found that when combined with Glycerin, the redness is worse when the product also includes PEg 40 Castor Oil

Sodium Citrate - this particular ingredient will make you irritated if you have open skin, so if your child has diaper rash, don't use these wipes. I have found that it also irritates ingrown hairs

Ethylhexylglycerin - this ingredient can actually cause contact dermatitis, it is not an ingredient that should be found in sensitive baby wipes, or in any baby wipes for that matter

Benzyl Alcohol - perhaps the most disturbing ingredient in these wipes, Benzyl Alcohol affects the immune system. Which means that the more you use a product containing it, the more that your skin reacts each time, meaning the reaction gets worse and worse. I've seen babies go from just redness from these wipes to blistered bottoms when I was working in a nursery and we had to use the wipes provided by the parents

At the end of the day the combination of ingredients in these wipes causes nothing but irritation and redness. These wipes are soft, thick, and easy to use. They handle large messes well. However, easy clean up should not be the only decision when choosing a baby wipe. There are many brands of safer wipes out there, and at the end of the day, these sensitive wipes are anything but sensitive."	&&&
I very much enjoy using Clorox wipes because it is a trusted brand	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes! They are easy to use and so convenient! Just wipe and toss!!	&&&
These wipes are great for everything, not just baby's bottom. I use them for spills, cleaning the counters, and more. There are enough wipes for me to use them on everything from A to Z and I still have enough to last 2 mos. Goog buy!	&&&
I love these wipes with having kids. There are so many germs out there and i use these for anything. I love using these esp on toilets, door knobs, light switches. Its nice knowing all the germs are gone and you have a perfectly sanitzed serface. If there was a travel size i would keep these in my purse!	&&&
Love wipes!!! So Easy and Convenient. Grab and Go!!! Not to mention the wipes smell so yummy and clean. Leaves a good clean smell around the house.	&&&
This product was not as advertised and I returned it. But you keep sending me letters saying that the item was not returned and that you are charging me again for the product. I gave the package to the UPS man that came to pick it up, and the online order information says it was returned and the delivery tracking shows that it was returned. Please fix this problem. Thank you, Lawrence Scaff.	&&&
I tried using generic "store bought" versions of these and they left horrible streaks on my glasses. These worked fantastically! No streaks, no odor. I do sometimes have to use two wipes to leave them totally clean depending on how long it's been since I last cleaned them, but the 600 count order was worth the purchase price- I think they will last me all year! and a plus side I saw these at Wal-Mart and they were more expensive per wipe than if you order the bulk 600 count on amazon!	&&&
"These things are the best...and NOT just for kids!

Our kids are 11 and 9 now, but these items are still a staple in our bathroom accessories."	&&&
Does a great job of cleaning up the residue from the prior site. We are new to the pump so trying out different products, and this one definatley worked for us.	&&&
No complaints at all. These wipes are just as good as any other we have tried, but make me feel much better about what goes on my baby's baby. Will only use these form now on...	&&&
I use this on my breast pump when I am at work. It is easy and gets the job done.	&&&
Pleased with them. Requested a list of what they are made of. The responded that they were checking. In the last three weeks there as still not a response.	&&&
Worst smelling lysol product I have ever bought- I used once and the bad smell wouldnt go away until I used another scented disinfecting wipe.. It seemed to permeate my skin and other objects on my counter top. Will gladly use products with bleach again and" health"in some other way."}},	&&&
These wipes are great. After a harsh winter with two kids sick, Boogie wipes never dried or scratched their faces like tissue would. And even with their sensitive skins, these wipes were never harsh. My older son who is 3 loves them too!!	&&&
I have tried them all these are the best wipes out.	&&&
I bought this because I am not a fan of the plastic packaging that the wipes we use comes in. This container holds plenty of wipes for my diaper bag and dispenses them well. The wipes do seem to dry out a little bit faster in this holder but I am still happy with the purchase.	&&&
I love pampers!! Hate using any other products on my baby. Pampers never lets me or my baby down, the wipes an diapers do the job very very well! Always a joy buying pampers products for my baby girl. She must like pampers too because she's always smiling when I change her diaper! :)	&&&
We can't live without our antibacterial wipes! We were desperate and found these - besides getting here quickly was a GREAT price. Are perfect for the pocket or purse.	&&&
Once I found these, I haven't bought any other brand!!My son had VERY sensitive skin when he was born and so we decided to switch to these. I love these wipes! They are more wet than normal wipes and I feel like that makes him extra clean. We have had no problem with skin irritation either, and the price isn't bad. I found a box with over 1000 of these on target.com for $27.99! Can't beat it! I bought that box in Febuary 2014 and we still have PLENTY!"	&&&
"I find the wipes tear when we try to get them out of the cantainer. Once out they really work well. Cleaned the screens well and no smears or streaks. My IPad looked like new!! Computer screens look good too."	&&&
I love all of the Seventh Generation products I've used so far, except for this one. The scent is really bad, and very strong. It is also very hard to get the scent off your hands after you use the wipes.	&&&
I actually just bought these last night and used them for the first time. I was looking for makeup removal wipes and these seemed like they would be easy on my skin. The wipes are great for removing makeup, but I absolutely cannot stand the scent. It's not a bad scent- it seems floral to me, but it was very strong when I first used the wipes. I thought it would dissipate, but even after sleeping all night I can still smell the scent o n my face and my hands. I'm seriously debating on whether to use these again even though I bought a full pack. If you don't mind the strong scent of flowers, these do seem to work well.	&&&
Great concept, I liked the idea of a large pop up opening but there was too much of a gap around the seam. It would dry out the wipes do I had to return it.	&&&
These wipes are great to use and do what they claim to do. They are gentle and soothing and have all natural ingredients with no added parabens or strong fragrances. Another benefit is that they are made in the U.S.A. The problem with them is they are probably NOT safe to flush down the toilet even though the package claims they are flushable. I noticed they do not break down like other wipes so I contacted the company (Laclede, Inc.) to check if they actually are safe to flush. They wrote back and advised you should throw them away if you have a septic system. Since these have the consistency of fabric and cannot break down, I would definitely throw them out after using and not take a chance of stuffing up your toilet (septic or other). I think it is irresponsible for the company to say they are flushable. I will continue to use but will throw them out after using.	&&&
"I typically buy off brand wipes so these are a but better in a couple ways;

They are bigger
More moist
Better smell
Softer

But I wasn't pleased with the overly ""soapy"" feel and how wet they left baby's bum. Also didn't seem to really absorb anything like a thicker wipe does.

All in all not a horrible wipe but didn't really meet up the the pampers name in my honest opinion."	&&&
"I was very excited when I saw these wipes, as I can never seem to clean windows and mirrors without streaks. I've always been pleased with other Clorox products, so I had high hopes for the glass wipes. Unfortunately, these wipes fell significantly short of what I expected. The cloths themselves seem okay, but they dried out quickly and left both streaks and lint behind. Thinking perhaps there was an odd residue on the mirror, once it was dry I used a second wipe and cleaned it again. Yet again, there were many streaks and tiny dots where I guess the cleaning liquid pooled, and lint was all over.

Honestly, using a generic window cleansing product with paper towels gives results that are as good or better, cost far less, and produce less waste. Now I am stuck with two full containers and one nearly-full container. Save your money and don't buy these!"	&&&
Love these wipes! They are so handy for quick wipe downs in the bathrooms and kitchen. I keep a container under all the sinks! Nice light clean smell.	&&&
So first, I love the idea of wipes for dogs. I have three dogs and I bathe them twice a week and they are STILL stinky. These wipes are great for in between baths to freshen them up. The smell is very mild and I need a good three for my German Shepard (the largest) but other than that I love them. I received these at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.	&&&
"Okay, really only three but when's wolf them NEVER bathes, it can sometimes smell like more. Ruffles is a very sweet cat who doesn't always get her fair share of attention because she is kinda gross. I ordered these wipes to help her get clean because I don't even know how a cat manages to be greasy. Anyway, these wipes did the job. She still looks a little scraggly but she's clean and she smells good. She tolerated the bathing quite well because the wipes were soft and not too wet. It was just like having a big love fest of petting. I recommend these wipes if you have an animal that needs a little help in the cleanliness department. They smell great, are strong, and larger than I expected.
I received these wipes at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."	&&&
I find these wipes to be the perfect size. They are soft and seem to maintain their moisture well.	&&&
Wipes dry out very fast.	&&&
Excellent product! Arrived faster!	&&&
"If I could leave no stars, I would. Awful product. I personally struggle with acne. For the most part I can keep it under control, however, when I used these my face broke out horribly. They don't clean very well. I use bare minerals makeup products, and in powder form, so you barely use any makeup as it is, but it took me using 3 of these wipes just to get all the makeup off of my face. Never will buy again.

Gave them to my sister-in-law who actually said she has used them in the past and they did the same thing to her, and she has perfect skin. She said she will use them as hand wipes in the car lol.

Highly not recommended!"	&&&
These wipes are a good price from a good brand, but my wife and I did notice that we were tearing a couple of these a week when getting them out of the wipe container. I guess being 'natural' they are not quite as strong as the regular huggies or pampers wipes.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. My baby girl has super sensitive skin and these wipes are never harsh. They are gentle and kind to her baby bottom.	&&&
I bought this on the "Amazon Prime Day" for a great deal! However, it is not comparable to the Costco wipes that I normally get. Costco wipes are a better value and quality. These wipes leave a weird residue on the skin after wiping. The smell is not that fresh either.	&&&
I love this wipes, smell is great and it really leaves my dog cleaned.	&&&
Love them my daughter does so good with them and even better I don't have to worry about rashes when it comes down to these wipes I used others that I got from my baby shower and these where the only wipes that she did great with.	&&&
These wipes are so thick and strong I don't have to worry about my fingers poking thru. It's soft and paraben free which is good with no dyes or scents I wish they were flushable but they are not so don't or you will have a big plumbing bill. That being said I just fold them inside the old diaper and no problem. I also love having them to wipe dirty hands and faces and even though they are used a lot I have not noticed any irritation or even redness from that.. "I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
I use these for the matte touchscreen in my car, and they are perfect for that! I've kept them in my car all summer, and the individually-packaged wipes haven't dried out.	&&&
"There’s really nothing quite like dingleberries to ruin your day- especially when your pets are permanent residents on your furniture. I know it’s not a pleasant image to bear in mind, but that pretty much sums up my need for these doggy wipes. I have two Chihuahuas that literally live on my sofa & a cat that likes to travel to all the hot spots in the house. So, being somewhat OCD it’s something I think about way more than I should. These cleansing wipes help with that quite a bit. They’re very thick, so they provide a sufficient barrier between my hand & the job at hand. And speaking of that job, their performance is excellent. They also smell nice without questionable ingredients.

I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
I love these wipes. They are clean, clean smelling, and clean ingredients. They are the right texture and the right thickness. These are the only wipes we use for my sensitive skin babies. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I purchase Seventh Generation almost exclusively on a regular basis, and have for all 4 of my children.	&&&
I bought travel sized package of these wipes and fell in love. These wipes are strong and absorbent. I actually use less wipes than when using other brands.	&&&
These came just in time!! I got home and the box with the wipes were waiting for me (and my pooch). My little furry friend decided to roll around in something really stinky when I let him out and was too tired to give him a complete bath. These worked really well at freshening him up and they smell good. I had to use a few wipes because they're small, but they are really moist unlike most towelettes that I've used. I received this product at a discount for my honest review.	&&&
I love the smell and quality of these wipes. I find that using Subscribe & Save to order these every couple months ensures I have some readily available anytime there is a clean up needed in our household. The containers are a great size from daily cleanups.	&&&
For our newborn, I purposefully bought different brands and types of wipes, to test them all out and see which worked best. These were definitely the cleanest, toughest, most gentle wipes that we tried. While others are too flimsy or too big, these are a perfect size and thickness. Also, I really appreciate that it's truly scent free, and doesn't leave a soapy/slimy residue on my baby's skin. And they're cheaper when you buy in bulk, so now that I've tried them all, I can trust buying tons of these Natural Care wipes!	&&&
These wipes work decently, smell good and are good for sensitive skin. My only issue that that sometimes you need a second wipe, and its $12 for 30 so that adds up pretty quickly if you use these regularly.	&&&
I love these wipes! We have 6 stinky little dogs (5 are Chihuahuas) who LOVE to roll around in the back yard, and come in with dirt and grass smudges all over their bodies & face. I'm constantly having to throw them in the tub and give them baths. These wipes work GREAT at giving them a quick clean when I don't have time to bathe them all. And they actually don't mind the wipes, either, and they hate taking baths, so I'm pretty sure they prefer the wipes too! These wipes easily remove the dirt and grass stains on their fur. Highly recommend! I received a box at a discount in exchange for my honest review.	&&&
"My dogs love to go out and roll around in dirt, mudd, weeds, anything they can find to roll around in. And they come into the house dirty and stinky. These wipes sure come in handy for a quick rub down to get rid of dirt and grass in their fur without us having to chase them around to get into the tub. Saves alot of time too. We have 2 German Shepherds so its not an easy task to always get them into the tub and get them clean. The wipes smell nice and takes about 2-3 for us to wipe our big dogs down when they are really dirty, but only about 1 when they don't have alot of filth on them. They seem to do a great job getting the dirt off them and leaves their coat soft as well. Very happy with this product.

*Received product for free/reduced price for an honest review*"	&&&
Why I love these wipes is the simple fact that they are extremely durable . You can use one for a multitude of things without it falling apart and , wow, do they smell amazing! I love smelling the lingering scent on my son after I clean him up with one!	&&&
We've tried a number of different wipes and these are clearly the best. They are the only ones we have found that consistently come out one at a time. This is so helpful when you are dealing with a messy diaper and rapidly kicking legs. The last thing you need is to have to detangle 5 wipes that come out all at once. By the time you get them sorted, you need more wipes to clean the feet, legs	&&&
Being a mom of 3 under 4 I am constantly needing to find quick ways to clean, and especially disinfect. I LOVE the clorox wipes. They work amazing and clean up any mess in no time.	&&&
Love these wipes!! Great for so many uses and smell great!	&&&
Love these wipes and it make me feel like Im protecting my family	&&&
I clean everything I can with the Clorox Wipes. They are so easy to use and disinfects as I wipe clean! I leave some in my bathroom and when I have guests they can wipe the seat if they would like to.	&&&
My intended use was twice a week at the local gun range as a gun, hand and table top wipe. I thought it came in a package that could be sealed between use. Not the case. Hence, the very fine product will be dry when I want to use it over the coming weeks. If you use it promptly it is fine, but for twice a week use over time it is not recommended.	&&&
Many friends and family gave us pampers wipes that I love so far. Most of them gave us Pampers Sensitive. Yes, the product is durable and soft. However, whenever I accidentally leave the plastic container open for an hour... wipes turn to be dry. I know it is my fault and it means using this wipes will not stay moist on my baby's butt, but I feel like I wasted many wipes because of that. Other than that, I am very satisfied with the p roduct. Thank you P&G!	&&&
We love Pampers wipes. They are soft and gentle and we can usually get the job done with fewer Pampers wipes, then multiple wipes of other brands. There are definitely differences in wipes and you want one that will get the job done.	&&&
I like the idea of environmentally friendly but not if things don't get clean. I have tried other "green" wipes, these are by far, my favorite. They have an odor but it is the smell of lemongrass and does not bother me a bit. They are wet enough to wipe up the peanut butter smear that my daughter often leaves in her wake without leaving any streaks. I also feel good when I have to use them for other messes like potty training or stomach virus type messes. They purportedly kill a lot of germs.	&&&
"I STARTED USING THIS WHEN I BROKE MY RIGHT ARM AND COULD BARELY TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. IT DOES GREAT CLEANING JOB OF BODY, SMELLS NICE AND IS EASY TO USE. I SINCE HAVE KEPT IN HOUSE FOR RUSH CLEAN UP WHEN DASHING OUT."	&&&
I can't say enough about these wipes!!! I LOVE them in the individual singles and carry them in my purse wherever I go so I can wash my hands before I touch food or anything else especially if I've been in a public place. With illnesses going around, you can't be too careful when trying to avoid getting sick! I also use them to wipe my cell phone down, my purse and my grandchildren when they need cleaning up.	&&&
These are the perfect size for wiping butts and noses and hands and everything. They do shrink a bit in the wash, but that just makes them fit in a typical wipes case better. So soft too!	&&&
"I use these to clean a woodturning face shield. They are effective for what I need. The wipes have to be pulled from the dispensor very carefully as they tend to tear as they are pulled."	&&&
these wipe are gentle on my son. We don't need to use a lot of wipes to clean up the messy. Highly recommended	&&&
Another great Pampers product! And great scent, too!!	&&&
Pampers wipes are the best on the market!! I only use two wipes when my LO has a dirty diaper. We had other brand wipes given to use so we used them they were not even close to the quality and value of pampers natural clean wipes. These wipes are moist ad very gentle on my little girls skin. She has sensitive skin so we need a good wipe. Pampers is great quality!!	&&&
I love Pampers diapers, but I am not a fan of the wipes. They are too stretchy which makes it hard to get just one wipe one-handed. They all want to come out at once, whether it is the refill box or the travel pack. They clean well, but because they are hard to get out I just prefer to get huggies wipes.	&&&
Along with the sensitive diapers, I used these wipes. He has never had a diaper rash and I am sure it's not only from staying on top of diaper changes, but because of this product too!	&&&
These are really cheaply made. They are about as useful as toilet paper for cleaning any kind of screen. It takes two wipes to clean a tablet as they start to fall apart almost immediately. I should've just got the spray and a cloth but thought this would work better for my situation (cleaning 20 tablets after use by elementary-age kids). Nope!"}}];	&&&
Another great Huggies wipe product. Works great for bottoms, hands and sticky faces on the run.	&&&
I have tried most of the sensitive skin wipes and prefer pampers. Other wipes either don't have enough wetness (seventh generation) or little pieces come off as I am wiping baby (Huggies sensitive). These have the right amount of wetness and don't easily break apart.	&&&
"So these wipes are what they say. They are wipes. They disinfect. They are convenient.

The only bad thing(s) I can say are:
I've used this for some spot treatment on my floor if I dropped something germy in the kitchen and it dries a little sticky.

The other thing is, I have two boys under 3 and they'll eat anything off the floor (including nomming away on toys)... I'm just a little worried about the safety/chemicals in here and wish The Honest Company would make something like this that is a bit safer for little ones."	&&&
"I have been using Pampers Wipes for almost 2 years now.
They are very gentle and soft to the touch. The scent is very subtle.
I have tried different brands and kept coming back to Pampers Wipes."	&&&
This set comes with 3 giant tubs (okay 75 sheets on each) of Clorox wipes which I love because I keep them throughout my house. I have tried the cheap brands before and they just don't work like Clorox does. These wipes are thick to do the job and I know it is killing viruses and bacteria (because I trust the Clorox name.) They smell nice and they do not leave a residue on the surfaces.	&&&
I've had two kids and these are by far the best wipes I have ever used. I still use those and will most likely never switch to another brand.	&&&
I really liked this wipes... They are very soft and gentle on the skin... The are just what i was looking for!!	&&&
After a few years of babies and trying several types of wipes I always go back to the Pampers Sensitive Wipes. Love, love, love them! They don't bother my babies' skin, moist, soft, and don't tear apart like others I've used.	&&&
"These truly are the softest wipes I have bought, love 'em. I wish I could afford for all my cloth wipes to be these.

I have only washed them about half a dozen times so far but they look like they will hold up really well. Didn't shrink or wrinkle after washing at all and are just super soft, great for a sensitive bum such as during a bad diaper rash time."	&&&
If you buy these wipes in the big boxes, you get one heck of a deal. They last for a very long time without sacrificing any of the gentle quality.	&&&
These are great wipes, they are gentle and they clean many different messes a child can make.	&&&
They are thick and cushy wipes that are free of all those yuck chemicals. They break down more easily in the environment - which is the main problem with wipes these days. Especially with the increase in population, and the increase in use of adults.	&&&
It's great to have the wipes for clean up of spills and quick tidying up.	&&&
I love all clorox products. I like the bleach and wipes best. I use the bleach at home and the wipes at work.	&&&
I love the ease of cleaning wipes and much prefer these more natural disinfecting wipes to those with bleach. They are made with Thyme oil and are effective against household germs including the flu virus. Also, I really like the herby smell.	&&&
With three kids at home, it gets quite messy. These wipes make it easy and fun for them to help us clean and the lemon scent makes our home smell fresh.	&&&
I have no other type of wipes in my stock pile. I have old 1959 counters in the starter home my family and I purchased and keeping stains from setting in I needed a wipe that can do that. I found that in Clorox wipes.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Lemon wipes for my kitchen and bathroom. Cleans and disinfects great and smells wonderful. I have this in my kitchen and all my bathrooms. Couldn't do without it.	&&&
I don't the flu this winter- I can't afford to be sick.	&&&
I hate stainless steel...I don't know what the hoopla is all about. The inside is great, the outside is a pain to keep clean. Especially when you have a dog that likes to lick everything - sliding door glass, appliances, knees, etc. I actually got a good shine with the wipes and a micro fiber cloth...and the licks were gone, too!!	&&&
These wipes are soft and thicker than the average wipes. I like how they do stretch a little bit but are thick and grab more than I most of the other kinds do. Plus even with diaper rash they tend to get everything without making it too much worse. I just wish they had bigger packages of the sensitive ones.	&&&

These monitor wipes are fantastic value. Something I always have to have due to kids touching the screen.	&&&
"I love these wipes. My baby got horrible rashes with huggies so since these were all natural we decided to use them. They worked great! Thick and soft! No more rashes!

The only downfall is the packaging. Sometimes 3 or 4 wipes will come out when you pull 1 out but that's not that big of deal. Regardless I love these wipes."	&&&
"These wipes are pretty awesome! Mine arrived and I opened them up and called the dog over.

She was a little nervous at first but then just took it like a petting. We had just gone out for a walk so she had that ""just came in from a walk"" smell, so why not?

After being wiped down she smelled much fresher than she did beforehand. One wipe does go a long way and that's all I needed to use. Her coat felt cleaner, smelled cleaner, and I'd say we were both happier for it afterwards.

I'm glad that I was given the chance to try these wipes out at a discount in exchange for my honest review. They're great!"	&&&
Through Generation Good i received these wipes for free to test out. They worked great. All of my opinions are honest and its well worth the try.	&&&
I absolutely loved these Amazon wipes. They are very thick and are more durable then the store brands. If I had to compare them I would say they remind me of White Cloud brand but these are larger with a nicer scent selection. Two wipes usually get even heavy jobs done. You'll love the 6 pack since you will find yourself using these for more than baby booties. We keep one in the bathroom to freshen up. I keep a pack in my car to handle little messes when were on the go. There's usually a pack in my purse and a pack in the diaper bag. After trying these we upped our subscription to 2 boxes at a time. Oh, I forgot to mention these have a cucumber and soap smell to them. The scent reminded me of some product they sell at Bath and Body works. If you aren't a fan of scented wipes you will want to stick to the sensitive or unscented version of these wipes.	&&&
I've been using these wipes since my kids were born that are now four. Me and my husband use them as well. We have them in every bathroom. They are reasonably priced and have no harsh or harmful ingredients. I've never had a problem with reaction or irritation whatsoever. I used the "sensitive" when they were first born and still use them as a carry pack as they have the plastic flip open and close. They are on the very wet side, but not a big deal. Plus, it's better than drying out. Great wipes! Great line!	&&&
Simple Make-Up Micellar Remover Wipes are fantastic for removing makeup and even waterproof mascara. They leave my skin feeling soft and clean. I've used makeup remover wipes by other brands that left my skin feeling tight and sticky. These wipes are gentle on my sensitive skin and there is no fragrance, which is a plus. The bag is easy to re-seal and is great for carrying in your purse or suitcase. Terrific wipes!	&&&
as a mom I love these wipes. They are thicker so they get all the poo. :)	&&&
these wipes are great. I have used thne for the past 2 years and have not been disapointed yet. with some other brands ive had wipes tear apart before i could even get them out of the pack. Proud to say I havent had that problem with these. My lo is sentive to some wipes and we actual have not had a problem with these. Clean great, very durable, great for adults too hahaha, and just overall great.	&&&
A really gentle wipe that removes all your makeup and truly cleanses the skin. Wipes are moist and effective!	&&&
Use these wipes in my classroom to clean up after the kids and get rid of germs!	&&&
I love using the Clorox wipes in my bathroom. They are so easy to use and they disinfect all surfaces	&&&
"Love the clean smell. This is by far the best disinfecting wipes I used!"	&&&
love cleaning with Cloroz wipes. On the go, in the bathroom, kitchen, where ever you are Clorox wipes come in handy!!	&&&
I use bleach wipes on a daily base like 4-6 times, love you the smell, the fact that I know it kills germs and disinfects the area I need!!!	&&&
A lot of wipes. Box seals well and keeps wipes moist. No strong perfume smell and seems safe for my cat.	&&&
I truly LOVE Pampers Sensitive Wipes. They remain moist (even when I forget to close the lid). They're great for cleaning small and large messes. The only downside is, they occasionally shed, but that's minimal. I purchased these wipes at a chain - drug store. As expected, they were more costly as compared with a larger retail store. It'd be WONDERFUL if the cost of the wipes and pampers sold at smaller stores mirrored the prices of the larger stores.& #xa; None-the-less: I'm a dedicated fan!!	&&&
Clorox wipes are a quick way to sanitize and clean up kitchen and bathroom areas.	&&&
These are the only wipes that my baby can tolerate. My baby rarely gets diaper rash because with the right diapers and the right wipes she is protected from the misery of diaper rash for both the parent and the baby. The thickness of these wipes protects the parent's hands from the mess and also gives these wipes the softness that a sensitive baby bum needs. These wipes have zero scent and they pull easily out of the package - which is important in those clutch moments. I would recommend these wipes for anyone with a baby.	&&&
I like the purity of these wipes but I received packages that had leaked and smelled funny. I never had mold issues we went through them too quickly. I wish they were biodegradable and a little bigger.	&&&
I tried the Simple Micellar Cleansing Water in the bottle and wasn't impressed. The wipes, however, are a different story. They're large enough to cover your face and neck, and are plenty wet. The wipe itself is textured, which provides a thorough cleansing. There's no heavy perfumey smell, and my face (early 50s, mature, dry skin) felt really clean without being tight and dry. My makeup routine is very simple, though... Bare Minerals powder and blush. I do not wear foundation or concealer. The wipes are a huge improvement over the liquid alone.	&&&
I wanted to like these wipes but couldn't get past the smell. I ended up giving them to my mom and she hated the smell as well. I won't be purchasing them again.	&&&
"I’ve had these dog wipes for a few weeks, and I have used them at least once every week since they arrived. Last night Molly had a case of diarrhrea. Poor Molly couldn’t get outside fast enough, and poop got all over her rear end. I used two wipes to get her nice and clean without the trauma of bath (it was late night).

I have also used the wipes to clean her feet from mud when we had rain and on the cat who had been rolling in the dirt. I was amazed in each case at the amount of dirt I saw on the wipe.

There is no heavy perfume odor to bother Molly who is not found on sweet smells, and the wipes can do a fairly heavy job in short order.

If you have a dog that loves sun baths in dirt, this is the product for you. For quick touchups, for serious cleaning between baths, these wipes will make your life, and your dogs, easier. I love them!

FIVE STARS!

I have always used Huggies wipes for my daughter. When my second daughter was born, I bought a pack of Parent's Choice wipes since they were a little bit cheaper. Mistake!! I threw that pack out and bought a case of Huggies wipes! Only wipes I'll ever use.	&&&
I love the wipes, they disinfest and are convenient to use.	&&&
My family likes to use wipes to stay extra clean. Other flushable wipes started to cause breakouts and rashes on everyone. We gave these a try and no more issues! I have even spread the word to other moms who have complained of the same issue and no more issues after switching to these.	&&&
I like Clorox Lemon Wipes because they disinfect and make everything smell good. They are excellent for stain removal specially when you have small children. Easy to use as well.	&&&
Be prepared to use the wipes upon opening the individual packets because they dry out pretty quickly. But considering their low price, volume and general effectiveness, the wipes are worth it.	&&&
I use the wipes on all of our hard surfaces. From our table to our stove and counter tops. I love the clean smell they leave behind.	&&&
Great product. Disinfects, deodorizes and clean scent	&&&
Love the wipes and the clean smell love you can do door handles table tops counter tops anything with the wipes	&&&
I love having clorox wipes on hand to quickly clean up. Being in school full time, with a family, being able to pull out these wipes and clean up fast is awesome.	&&&
These are always handy to have to clean up after kids. We have a can of wipes in each room for emergency messes. The smaller travel packs are good for the car, these larger canisters of wipes are ideal for home.	&&&
I am VERY disappointed with Huggies with these wipes. I usually purchase Pamper's wipes however, I had a coupon and decided to try these out. BIG MISTAKE. These wipes tear so easily, I cannot place them in my wipe warmer because they come out in pieces. They are VERY thin and not very moist. I do not know if I received a bad batch or if this is standard for Huggies..I hope not. I will not be purchasing these again.	&&&
"We have been using Huggies wipes after experimenting with other brands and even private label wipes. We found the Huggies to be the best. They are soft and sturdy (i.e. don't come apart while using). And the package is really handy and well-designed with the closure flap that really works every time.

I have noticed, though, that lately prices have been increasing rather rapidly. It seems that material cost is either increasing or there is more demand for these all around the world and they can charge more and maintain the customer base. i just hope they don't push it too much to the point where I would be forced to look elsewhere."	&&&
I love using Clorox Wipes! They are so convenient and really make cleaning easy. When I'm done cleaning with these wipes, I know that all the surfaces are germ free!	&&&
I tried the Pampers Sensitive wipes even though my son doesn't need sensitive ones but I wasn't a fan. They seem to be very thick which isn't really necessary. I go through a lot of wipes so I prefer to get more and could care less how thick they are.	&&&
"These are great for the baby and car. They stay moist for a long time. We get these every month or so with Amazon Mom and put them in our Prince Lionheart wipes warmer.

I would have given a 4 star review if the package was resealable, but since it is a refill pack you have to immediately add them to either a warmer or a box.

Also, the fragrance isn't really all that strong, but it is a fresh and clean smell and will kind of stick with you."	&&&
You get what you pay for, right? A bit thin but still cleans without going through the wipe. The biggest negative is that you can't rip in half. Going back to Huggies wipes.	&&&
These are thick and sensitive enough for my babies skin.	&&&
I bought these boogie wipes to keep on my school bus, they are so convenient for sticky hands and spills on the seats. Best of all I don't have to worry about anybody being allergic to them, they do such a good job at cleaning up little messes.	&&&
Love all of the kandoo products, especially the wipes. They are easy to use and perfect for even the unexpected needs!	&&&
Before trying Boogie Wipes my daughter always got upset when using a regular tissue because they irritated her nose. Since we started using Boogie Wipes the irritation issue is no longer a problem. They also smell great.	&&&
My little monkey does not like to get his face wiped at all, however you bring out the Boogie Wipes and we do the Boogie dance and he let's me wipe his face and nose.	&&&
I have used boogie wipes for quite a few years, having originally purchased them from Costco. I was in a panic once they stopped carrying them but found them again at Walmart. I use them constantly, I love their portability and effectiveness of wipe little noses without drying them out. I can't survive a winter with out them!	&&&
I have tried many types of wipes and brands and haven't found a wipe I love yet, but if I had to pick a favorite, this would be it. Some wipes are slimy, some are very dry or very small or rough - but this seems to have a good balance of wetness and the size is decent. The only thing I wish could be improved is the ease of dispensing from the package. I find that you really have to dig at it to get a wipe up. Other than that, I've been happy with these.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes. They beat out all other brands that I have used. They are thick enough not to tear just thin enough to get into crevices where you need them. My little one was a 2 month preemie and was able to use these without any irritation. She is now 4 months old. So far, so good!!	&&&
These Simple make-up remover wipes are gentle on my skin, and removes makeup extremely well. Many eye makeup remover products irritate my eyes, but not these! Even my hard to remove eyeliner come off with a gentle swipe. My face feels clean and soft after using these wipes.	&&&
We love to use Boogie Wipes on our little guy's nose. They're soft & don't irritate little noses like a regular tissue can. They're great to use to get those extra hard crusties off that tend to happen overnight.	&&&
I have used parent's choice wipes in my home daycare for two years now. We use them for everything. They stand up to heavy use! And are gentle enough to use on all our kids! And these wipes are easy on the budget!	&&&
Simple make-up remover wipes work well, taking off eye makeup along with the foundation, dirt, oils and other impurities that my skin attracts throughout the day. My face is prone to breakouts with new products, but this didn't cause any. It's very gentle on the skin. It doesn't make your eyes sting when removing mascara or eyeliner. First few wipes seemed a little on the dry side. After using a few, they were the perfectly damp. This a good product and really does the job of getting the makeup off at the end of the day.	&&&
I bought these wipes to try and I'm very glad I did! They are extremely strong and cleaned tough greasy messes. I highly recommend them to others and I will continue to purchase them again. My kids love them and that goes a long way!	&&&
These are great wipes for my potty trained toddler. I love that they are flushable and they are also very gentle on sensitive skin. I've tried other brands and they irritated her skin. They are good quality and a good size, unlike any others I have tried. They have become difficult to find so I'm glad I was able to buy them here. When I did, I was sure to stock up!	&&&
These wipes are super useful to have in my purse. They aren't baby wipes so my preschoolers don't get offended when I use them on their faces. And a huge bonus they smell amazing!	&&&
I bought Kandoo Sensitive Wipes for my 7 year old to take to school. I always bug him this product because the wipes are super soft and clean great.	&&&
We love the multi packs of boogie wipes. We keep one in car, one I. Diaper bag and one in the house:) they are great for runny noses and messy mouths. Boogie wipes are gentle on skin and we love the yummy smell of the grape ones!! Everyone can use boogie wipes!	&&&
I love these. I use them for everything. I don't like to use baby wipes to clean my kids face but these work great.	&&&
These have been my go-to wipes for 3.5 years. They were fantastic. Today I received my regular shipment and they are a new formulation. The new version is TERRIBLE. It is like using see-through toilet paper at a gas station instead of the nice quilted kind at home. They are too soapy and way too thin. Please change them back!!!!!!!!	&&&
These wipes are convenient and clean nicely. The only problem with the order is that they didn't send me the particular type I ordered.	&&&
I love this product. My son has sensitive skin and hates his face touched, and these boogie wipes are a God sent product!!! One quick swipe and all that yucky allergy mess is gone. Believe me I have to be quick to wipe his little nose he's gotten much better since I've started using boogie wipes. Just want to say thank you Boogie Wipes and I will recommend you to everyone! !	&&&
I have been buying these wipes for a few years now, onto baby number 4! We started with original and found grape was available-yummy! We have canisters around the house, 45 ct packages in the cars and 10 ct packs in all of our bags and purses. I can't believe we were wiping our noses without these in the past! Congested kids no longer get scab-rimmed nostrils due to blowing too many times with tissues. And the smell of fabulous grape makes you happy to have blowed :)	&&&
We've been using these wipes for 3 years and for the most part, we really like them. They're not too wet and they don't feel slimy like a lot of the other wipes on the market. As far as I'm concerned, if a wipe can remove paint or Sharpie marks, I'm not using it on my kid's skin! It's true that they might mold if they're left in really warm environments. I had this happen once to a package left in my diaper bag in my car during the hot NC summer. I typically take them out of the plastic wrapper and put them in a wipes case on my changing table and have never had a mold issue there.	&&&
Very soft on my babies bottom. Cleans even the messiest messes	&&&
I must say I love pampers wipes , there soft but strong enough to do the job	&&&
These wipes are thin enough to get into all the little rolls and creases of baby girls.	&&&
MAKES YOU FEEL NON - ITCHY, LEAVES YOU FEELING FRESH AND CLEAN. USE THESE DAILEY AND NO MORE 'ILL' FEELING, TY!	&&&
My daughter and I both have sensitive skin and these wipes and all pampers do not irritate our skin and love the scent.	&&&
Although I adore pampers swadders I don't typically buy pampers brand wipes. I find that they are a little thin, and dont always come apart well when you are single handedly pulling them out of the dispenser with a squirming infant. They are my second choice.	&&&
I love all of the Burt's Bees products they have for the baby and the products They have for adults.	&&&
These Little Wipes Can Pick Up A Lot Of Makeup. Just Be Careful Around The Eyes When Removing Eyeliner & Mascara. Face Feels Clean afterwards.	&&&
I do not like the packaging for these. They come in one big pack with 3 refills divided by some wax paper. The wipes are really thin (width). I hate having to keep tubs around to refill, I like having the resealable packages. When we used these on are then 2 month old, it was a red butt by the end of the day. We went back to the other brands sensitive ones.	&&&
"I regularly purchased this item at stores, so I am familiar with the unscented version. This is NOT unscented.
Xxxxxxxx"	&&&
"When I spotted this product, I knew this was a necessity, just like diapers. This product is perfect for at home or on the go quick fixes. There aren't any harmful ingredients, and does exactly what it says. It removes any dirt, lint, or germs that may be on a pacifier, bottle, or toy. I love this product because my son's car seat material fuzzes really bad, and I can't carry 40 pacifiers in the diaper bag, nor am I always near a sink.
I wish these came in a larger pack!"	&&&
I cannot praise these more. I had become allergic to others but these are wonderful and I would be lost without them. I do not flush them; however, because of the news report of how the wipes are a problem at the sewer plants.	&&&
These are good to use. They hold together are moist, they are large enough.Not perfumed,none of them have ripped I like them	&&&
This product is strong enough to clean almost everything and very soft texture to protect my baby's skin. I am very concerned my baby's skin so whenever I go out with my baby, I take this wipes. After eating, playing outdoor, whenever baby needs to be refresh her hands, this wipes do all.	&&&
These wipes are too thin. Liken to moist dryer sheets. No thanks. Pampers diapers are the ONLY brand for my boy. But the wipes, we have a different fav	&&&
My wife has not delivered yet, but she is a person that could take on a job as a perfume quality assurance with her heightened sense of smell. Sometimes I feel helpless when I buy things that has a smell that she could not stand. These wipes did not bother her senses at all! I am amazed!! No more F bombs from her!! Thank you clearly herbal!!	&&&
I can buy the same product at the store for $3.96. I was quite disappointed in the price difference in these....	&&&
I'm going to be a new mom and will definitely use these wipes. They are soft and no irritating. I know because I have to use wipes now and these are what i use and they work great. Definitely a great deal to buy the big box.	&&&
Best wipe, soft, doesn't smell, cleans well, prefer over many other brands of wipes!	&&&
I loved these wipes. I felt like they were the softest to use on my baby's bum. However, we just bought another pack and I noticed that the wipes were fuzzy, like they were falling apart. I'm hoping that it was just the box that I got because I really do like these baby wipes. "	&&&
I bought these instead of the natural because I thought it would be good to have wipes that are also good for everyday non-diaper use. I liked that the packaging seemed to indicate that these are an all-in-one product. I just opened them this week and I was shock at how rough the wipe itself is. I find myself being more and more careful when I wipe my daughter to ensure she doesn't get irritated. I will not buy these again and I wish I didn't spend the money on all of these wipes that I now have to replace.	&&&
They are great for sensitive skin; however, every time I use it, I'm pulling the thin, hair-like strands of the wipe material off my kid's butt. I find them when I'm applying the diaper cream. Weird.	&&&
With 4 kids and 3 dogs I use Clorox wipes more than I use any other cleaning product in my home. I believe I use more wipes than laundry soap and that is saying a lot since 42 pairs of jeans, 44 shirts, 6 uniforms, and tons of socks are washed weekly.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I use them daily to keep my kitchen and bathroom looking sparkly clean.	&&&
I love the wipes because they disinfect and are extremely easy to use.	&&&
"These wipes are very handy. They are guaranteed to never lose their moisture down to the last towel. Softy wipes do as well as any other cleaning wipes towel I have used. The big plus about these wipes is they do not contain alcohol. They do still kill 99% of the germs like a regular towel as they claim. I have no way to test that though. Wiping down surfaces, body, or hands these towels do not leave a soapy or sticky film. They also have vitamin E and Aloe in the towels. I like these wipes a lot because they are not little bitty super thin things I am used to. The towels have a decent smell to them (citrus). It is not an overpowering smell either.
Personally I have used these towels on counter tops(tile), my hands and face after some BBQ, table tops (wood), and the floor even after I dropped my plate. I did not see any damage to any of the surfaces. The towels are very soft and feel great on the skin when cleaning up. I am very happy with these towels over all. They do a terrific job on everything I have tried to clean thus far.
I was also told that I can offer a 50% off coupon code for these towels: 7J95L6AU
Enter this code at the time of check out to receive the discount.

I would like to thank Softy for allowing me to test this product."	&&&
Great product, very convenient when you need a quick clean!	&&&
Three pack of the normal sized wipes. As expected. Easy clean up with little ones in the house"}},	&&&
"I love that these wipes are the least chemically laden wipes I can find on the market. However, I must remove a star for the following reasons:

1. The top 1/3 of the wipes of each pack are pretty dry compared to the bottom 2/3 or so. I've ordered two mega value box cases and I've noticed this to be pretty consistent with each pack.
2. They are difficult to pull out one by one.
3. They are definitely not nearly as soft as Huggies or Pampers wipes.

All in all, I'll continue to use this brand, but I hope they can fix at least the first two issues I've been having."	&&&
I love Clorox wipes and I use it everywhere. I specially like the wonderful lemony scent it leaves. The surfaces just feel clean in addition to actually being clean.	&&&
Love these! I use them for everything, from cleaning my kitchen and bathrooms, to wiping down tables and chairs. Great!	&&&
I always have a resin to use my clorox wipes. They are great because they are easy to take with you when you are on the go.	&&&
We use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for all of our clean up needs. They are easy and powerful cleaners.	&&&
We use these with a spray bottle of water for diaper changes. I actually cut them into half and some into fourths as well, the smaller ones for pee changes and larger for poo changes. The first box of wipes were still using and he's 10 weeks old now. I plan to cut the second box of these wipes only in half this time because he's getting older and bigger. I also think they work great for cleaning the outer part of his ear because their so thin and delicate and I plan to bring a bunch of these when traveling instead of burp cloths since I won't have to worry about washing them.	&&&
With 2 kids, ages 3 and 1, Clorox wipes is my go to for cleaning! I clean everything with them, including the kids! In a household that is always getting dirty, I know I can rely on Clorox to get the job done right the first time!	&&&
I love using the Clorox wipes for a quick cleanup and love the clean smell it leaves.	&&&
I love and prefer Clorox Wipes to clean and disinfect almost everything!!	&&&
Other brand I was using streaked. Weiman wipes don't so easier and shorter cleaning time. Now the only wipes I use to clean my stainless steel appliances.	&&&
I have a two year, messy boy!! This wipes are perfect.	&&&
Boogie wipes.. A+ product, great for a runny noses	&&&
I got these yesterday to polish up my silver jewelry, earrings and necklaces. The wipes worked fantastic! Even in an older necklace that has snake-chain with tarnished grooves. It took a little extra elbow grease but 1 wipe cleaned it better than any other polish/paste/soak I've tried before. They even polished up costume jewelry which I decided wasn't worth keeping but still! I'm so glad I found these wipes as I only wear silver, this makes upkeep so much easier!!	&&&
I've been using Boogie Wipes on my children since they were born (they are now 5 and 2). My son will even go and grab them himself when we need to blow his nose. I highly recommend these to everyone!	&&&
This product is exceptional. I use to dread having to use regular baby wipes for my children's noses because I knew they didn't like the smell of them. With boogie wipes, (we chose the fresh scent), my kids don't mind me wiping their noses now. The wipes smell great, are soft for their little noses and yet tough enough to get off that stubborn crust. Will continue to recommend boogie wipes to everyone!	&&&
Ever since I started using boogie wipes with my first son (who is now 5 years old!) I have not gone back to regular facial tissue with my second-born (currently 9 months old). It doesn't irritate there nose, which I have noticed that their sensitive skin gets irritated very easily. This product is the best for my munchkin's noses. Awesome wipes!	&&&
I mostly buy the Disinfecting Wipes for cleaning my kitchen and my bathrooms. With a 3 yr old and an 8 yr old, it's a constant struggle keeping common areas clean. The wipes make clean up a lot easier and quicker.	&&&
The wipes are fine and as good as other wipes I've used. The container causes some issues. Once the stack gets low, it's hard to grab and pull through the hole. Yes, you can open it and redo. But when it happens using every other wipe, the container is more of a nuisance than help. I'd rather purchase without the container, and use it for my wipes when I need.	&&&
I love clorox wipes they are the only disinfecting wipes I have ever used in my house.	&&&
I like Clorox wipes because they are easy to use. I don't like using sprays that I end up inhaling. I give them four stars because I wish the clothes were a little bigger and thicker.	&&&
I keep some packets in the car and my purse for quick clean-ups. The fragrance is clean; no lingering smell. The vendor shipped on time and the box of wipes was well packaged for shipping. This was a good buy!	&&&
I used to only use Biore. I thought Biore was the best until.... About a year ago I started having a hard time finding the Biore wipes so I went online and still had a hard time finding them in stock anywhere. So in a hurry and desperate for some wipes, I decided to try a few different brands and "test" them out. Aveeno was one of those I tested. All I can say is I'm glad I "had" to find an other solution because these Aveeno wipes are the BOMB! I love them. They do the job and they do it "gently". I love the scent too. I feel like my skin is so "refreshed and energized" after using them! Thanks Aveeno!	&&&
great product love using his product. use all the time.	&&&
This pack of Lysol® Disinfecting Wipes, Lemon and Lime Blossom Scent, is very handy and portable. I leave one in the car to clean and sanitize hands, wheels, and other cleaning purpose. It scents well after the cleaning. I've used these for a long time and I really like the convenience of them, especially this small containers. They do keep the wipes stay moist. The product does what it is designed for. I always keep them at home and in the car for kids to use. I would recommend this product."}},	&&&
i love the Clorox wipes. I carry them it in my car and it has came in handy several times. When I take my grandson to restaurants I always take the Clorox wipes in to the restaurant with me. I always wipe down the table where my grand baby will be eating and plus I wipe down the booster seat or high chair he is sitting in. Clorox wipes makes me feel more confident that I am doing everything possible to protect my grand baby from flu and viruses.	&&&
This is the most annoying baby wipes I've got. Each wipe comes out individually and the next one doesn't follow.	&&&
This is a nice thick wipe that doesn't fall apart when you are using it and they never feel dried out like some other wipes. I love the scent and it is still gentle on my baby's skin without being "unscented".	&&&
We love Clorox wipes in my house. I have a 1 1/2 year old son that is always making a mess somewhere and Clorox wipes have been a life saver for cleaning up his messes.	&&&
I love the wipes because they are quick and easy to use for disinfecting. What other brand will get your whites whiter than Clorox.	&&&
"Baby wipes can be used for so many different things.

I use the unscented ones for cleaning counter tops, any time my cats spill food or make a mess of any kind, whenever I need to clean something made of leather, and for cleaning any electronic that is not turned on. These don't leave a scent and I really like the fact that the wetness lasts very long in the whole container.

I don't have a baby so I can't say how they work on babies."	&&&
These are my favorite wipes to use when my daughter has a cold. They are not abrasive on her face like a tissue would be, and they work so much better! Plus since she's so little and doesn't like to stand still, the moistness really makes such a big difference in wiping her nose! I feel so much better using these than a diaper wipe with harsh chemicals. I keep them everywhere - in my purse, diaper bag, car, even in the cubby at my daughter's school. Highly recommend!	&&&
I am a always in need of wipes and found this product to be perfect. I really like the way it feels, non sticky just leaves your fingers soft.	&&&
I purchase Boogie Wipes so often. They are the best. We have them in every car, in every bedroom and living area. They are great and make runny noses easier. Thank you for a great product.	&&&
I love clorox wipes! Good price! One came leaking but there is so much liquid in the bottles that it wasn't a big deal.	&&&
Great product for a great price! I will be a repeat customer!!	&&&
Kandoo Flushable sensitive wipes are perfect for children who are gaining their independence and learning the importance of good personal hygiene. Kandoo wipes stay moist and are a must have for our household.	&&&
I bought Boogie Wipes for my Great Grand Kids but found out that they are really great to carry in my purse. The 10ct. fit in small purse and they are great for emergency's. Sorry I have never learned how to do pictures on the internet.	&&&
Forget my kid, I really buy the grape scented boogie wipes for myself. Really, they're that good!	&&&
when my little one gets a runny nose, boogie wipes are helpful to have on hand! No irritation, helps with his stuffy nose, affordable and convenient!	&&&
The cool thing about these wipes is my nieces love the grape scent!! Whenever I have my nieces for the day I always make sure I have good stock of wipes. These wipes not only work great but the scent makes it fun for the girls. They love them so much that I have to hide them because otherwise the girls would grab them all up and use them cleaning everything in sight (even twice), Thanks for making a great product that not only gets the job done but makes it fun at the same time!!!	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes! As a mother of 2 young children, it's a great thing to have around the house to take care of all the messes my children make.	&&&
love love love clorox wipes and all other products. I feel like everything I clean with them is actually fresh and really CLEAN!	&&&
I have 3 kids under 4 and am in the middle of potty training the 2 yr old twins. I discovered cottonelle flushable wipes about a year ago while potty training the oldest. They are great for little ones who are learning to clean up after themselves. Sometimes toilet paper isn't enough and regular baby wipes can't be flushed. Thanks cottonelle for a great product!!	&&&
great wipes to use especially during flu season to kill germs	&&&
I love how easy Clorox wipes are to use and how clean they make it feel after using them.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for a quick clean-up on my bathroom sinks.	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use for cleanup in any room of the house!	&&&
This is the only brand of disinfecting wipes that we use.	&&&
I like the clorox wipes because there are easy to use and make it much more efficient for me to clean my house while disinfecting it.	&&&
Love the wipes !!! Removes stains from my counter easily.	&&&
These are great cleaning wipes. I like the fresh scent even better	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are great when cleaning my counter tops.	&&&
"I have been using kirkland brand for some time i have also used huggies. These particular ones seemed smaller and i do not like the fact that they do not have a slot where to take the wipes out..
I use them on a 11 mo old and a 3yr old.. to small to wipe a 3 year old.."	&&&
just like the sensitive diapers, these wipes work well with a baby who prone to rashes. and I don't have to wipe a coat of diaper rash to prove it.	&&&
I love these wipes they come in handy especially when you want to freshen up or just for general use instead of toilet paper while on period	&&&
The lidded soft pack is definitely the way to go over the regular soft pack. The wipes are thick and they don't all stick together so you can pull them out one at a time. This really comes in handy when you are trying to quickly tend to a blowout while keeping one hand on a wiggly baby. Thanks BabyGanics!!	&&&
These are the only wipes that my daughter can use; any others (including other "sensitive" brands) and she breaks out in a horrible rash. (We use baby washcloths with water when home, but when out or for really nasty diapers, this is it for us.) I appreciate that they are truly unscented, even though that means they do smell a little funky sometimes... better that than perfumes that we are allergic to. I only wish they were a little softer and/or thicker. The "Thick Care" are TOO thick for me, but these are just a smidge too thin. Oh well.	&&&
"Priced well. I didn't actually get this for sanitizing specifically. I was hoping by using these wet wipes I could get rid of or at least reduce the strong Frito smell on the bottom of my small dogs feet! LOL. Well, I guess I better find something that say's deodorizing. I don't know why his feet smell like that. Like a week after I bathe him, there's that smell again! I feed him Nutro Max food and only chicken jerky as treats. I keep my dog clean and his paw pads smell is a mystery to me. Ugh. Oh well, I'll use these up but after a week of daily scrubbing his feet bottoms thoroughly - this hasn't helped. Oh well. At least I know his footsies are clean, lol.

Nice fresh smell to these wipes. After yanking (from the center) 5 of them, I could finally get the clip thing on the lid to work although I'm not a fan of those type lids. A tissue style holder with snap on lid would dispense better.

I must need some industrial strength deodorizer for dog paws, sheesh"	&&&
I really don't like Huggies wipes. They are thick, but they remind me of charmin toilet paper. They leave little pieces on my babies' bums. "	&&&
We started out with Pampers sensitive wipes from the early days when our little one came home from the hospital. We weren't sure if he'd have any skin sensitivities so we chose to start out with the Sensitive Wipes. We've been very pleased. On occasion, we'd use other brands that we received as baby shower gifts, but others were more abrasive to the touch and weren't as wet as the Pampers wipes (so we'd w ind up using more of the other brand wipes). Pampers wipes are gentle to the touch and make cleaning up a breeze.	&&&
i love the unscented wipes for my kids they are perfect for the school locker and their backpacks too.	&&&
The best wipes for us. Used them for many years for our sensitive skin. Won't use any other kind	&&&
We love the ease of use with Boogie Wipes - they are gentle on little notes, easy to transport, and our boys love them! They are spoiled and regular baby wipes just won't cut it!!!	&&&
My kids love these wipes. They are the perfect size for little hands. They don't rip, they are soft on little bottoms and they don't irritate sensitive areas. I also keep them in my purse because they are smaller than regular wipes and great for on the go, wiping face and hands. They are versatile. I like that they are flushable too.	&&&
I have been using these on my daughter ever since she was 2 years old when I got a sample. She's 5 now, and I feel good using them to wipe her nose because they don't make it raw. Her nose always seems to be running due to allergies and sometimes colds. I'm glad to have Boogie Wipes handy.	&&&
I personally think these wipes are awesome they get the job done and they're really good however the package is really small and for $12 I don't really think it's worth it so that amount you should be getting 60 wipes instead of 30	&&&
Great product. Good quality materials and finish.	&&&
We've been using Boogie wipes in our home for over five years! We love the durability and the fresh scents to encourage even sore red noses to be wiped. Our newest baby is entering into her first autumn and is taking nose wiping like a champ with the unscented wipe packs. We've already started stocking up for the winter!	&&&
My entire family uses Boogie Wipes whenever we catch a cold. Our noses don't get red, dry, and cracked from constant blowing like they do when we use traditional facial tissues. Boogie Wipes are great!	&&&
Hi I have tried all kinds of wipes before,But then I found boogie wipes,These wipes are great.	&&&
These remover wipes have good and bad properties! They remove my stubborn makeup well with just one wipe. The exfoliating side really does the job - it left my skin smooth. There isn't a strong or unpleasant smell. The problem I had was that it made my skin feel itchy. I tried it a few days after having the itchiness to see if maybe it was how it reacted with my makeup and had the same reaction. The other issue is the label. It doesn't reseal well and my first pack of wipes dried out after 2 weeks. I purchased these at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.	&&&
We love these handy wipes. We keep a few in the car as well as anywhere we might need them.	&&&
Gentle, SIMPLE and best of all, my skin looks BETTER after every single use!! No redness, no drying, fast, easy and no mess! I have tried the spectrum of makeup removers from the expensive to homemade and SIMPLE MICELLAR Makeup Remover Wipes are truly in a class all their own!What's not to LOVE??	&&&
I bought these on the advice of others. I was skeptical because I thought baby wipes would do the trick. Wrong. Something about these "grabs" all the goo from my daughter's nose, especially the crusty stuff. I think the saline breaks it down better or something? And the cloth holds on better than a regular baby wipe. Love love love the Fresh Scent, too. Before, my daughter got a cold and ended up with a cracked, raw nose. With Boogie Wipes, the goo comes off and her nose is pretty normal looking. I now keep a canister at home, at my Mom's, and small packs in my bag and car. Love!	&&&
I LOVE this Wipe Warmer! It is compact to carry with you in your diaper bag, and sturdy enough to use at home everyday! It also has a car adapter, so you can keep the wipes warm in the car. Hard to believe you need one in Arizona, but it's wonderful! My kids never screamed during diaper changes anymore, and it was a blessing when we drove up north to go play in the snow. ... Older son puked in car, pulled to the side (cold & snowy), and wiped him with these warm wipes. It was perfect!	&&&
I reach for unscented Boogie wipes whenever I have a cold or even a allergy attack! They keep my nose from getting raw and cracking - unlike plain paper tissues! There's also no paper dust, which keeps even more sneezing at bay. Why would you want to use a paper tissue to blow your nose and make you sneeze even more? Doesn't make sense. So that's why we have a pack of Boogie wipes in every room, instead of a box of thinly folded paper. My kids even love the grape scented wipes, and my youngest child at 2 years old, even knows how to ask for them by name! If you're looking for relief and comfort from boogies, you have to stock up on Boogie Wipes.	&&&
This is a great buy. They are big packs and not the refill packs for wipes..	&&&
"The scent REALLY irritated me and stuck to my hands after washing them several times.

Using these wipes also made my hands become really red and irritated. I had to use gloves. For the non-scented ones, I never had that problem.

The scent is really strong and it does irritate your hands if you have sensitive skin. They get the job done and are strong wipes."	&&&
I bought these when my daughter got sick and they were the best wipes ever! No irritation after using them and my daughter loved them. They really do work! Everything just sticks to them. Thank you boogie wipes!!	&&&
I love boogie wipes for babies and kids! I've been using them forever! I don't have time to see if the tissue I grabbed has lotion but I know boogie wipes are always comforting and my son won't run from them. I've included them in birthday party favor bags and always put them in baby shower gifts to start new fans! I even use them! I appreciate the smaller packs for traveling and the bulk ones for when I know allergy or cold season is coming!	&&&
I have to say I was very leery about buying Parent's Choice wipes, but with this new scent I decided to give them a try. I have to say I love them! They feel like they are good quality and I like that. They also clean my 3 month old very well. As long as they continue to have this new scent I will continue to buy them.	&&&
my absolute favorite baby wipes! I live by these. Great scent. Sensitive on my babys skin. Cloth like	&&&
I used KanDoo wipes previously, but this was a better price so I trid them out. They material of the wipe is much stronger than the KanDoo and I like the dispenser these come in a lot more as well. I'll be using these from now on.	&&&
These wipes are GREAT! So like every mom out there I love to save money. I always thought oh no, i don't need boogie wipes, I have regular wipes that I already buy when I get diapers. Well a friend bought my daughters a pack of Boogies Wipes & I absolutely fell in love! They are the softest wipes & smell AMAZING! It's such a soothing sent & with the texture you won't have your kiddos ripping their nose away from you!	&&&
I've been using boogie wipes since my 7yr old was a baby it's has an amazing smell they are soft, and they fit anywhere I wouldn't change them for any other. All of their products are amazing, good job and thank you	&&&
Thanks, fine!	&&&
I like to use the disinfecting wipes when I am on the go. I am constantly using Clorox bleach to clean all types of messes. I do not recall right off, the name of any other brand I have known, as long as Clorox.	&&&
I love how easy Clorox disinfecting wipes are to use! I feel confident that my kitchen stays clean and bacteria free when I use them to wipe the counters down.	&&&
I use the wipes every week in my classroom to clean the students' tables. It cleans perfectly and it's easy for the students to clean them for me!	&&&
Great wipes. I recommend getting the warmer as baby won't like cold wipes.	&&&
I love using clorox wipes at work to clean my desk and station site. It's convenient, quick and easy.	&&&
Having four children under the age of 9, Clorox wipes makes my cleaning a breeze!	&&&
I absolutely love the clorox wipes. They make cleaning so much easier. Thank You Clorox!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They are easy to use when you are a mom that needs to clean up messes quick!	&&&
Disinfects and deodorizes great multi purpose wipes	&&&
The best wipes there are! I will admit that I have tried the other brands and generics, and they all leave residues and are sticky. Clorox are the only ones I will use- learn from me!	&&&
I LOVE Clorox wipes. They are great to keep on hand in my bathroom for easy cleaning!	&&&
I really like the wipes. No spraying, just wipe and the mess is gone.	&&&
I just received a sample of these wipes in my order. First thing I noticed, like others who reviewed this product, they are indeed very saturated. I personally like this though, it's like a facewash in a wipe, and I certainly would rinse my face post-wipe. It was a bit tricky around the eyes due to how sudsy the wipes are, so definitely be weary when removing your eye makeup. I did not experience any burning in my eyes from using this product, even though I may have gotten some in my eyes. I find they do a great job of removing product with ease. I will be buying these soon!	&&&
I wouldn't use any other brand, these wipes are amazing! I use them on myself and for my whole family!!!	&&&
"We have been using these for our newborn daughter and they are excellent. The quality is high and the wipe is quite thick- I actually sometimes think I grabbed two by accident when I only took one.

It wipes effectively and has no odor. You can fold the wipe over and still be able to use it also. We will continue to use these Pampers wipes."	&&&
I love these wipes! They are gentle enough for both bottom and face. I've been using them since my baby was born. I also love that this box comes with two wipe dispensers.	&&&
I just got this in the mail. I noticed a corner of the box was wet. I opened it and noticed that one of the three plastic bags containing the wipes had a ripped quarter-sized hole! I would return it but I don't want to deal with trying to find a box, packaging up the whole thing, and sending it in when I need the wipes now. I also don't like the way they package all the wipes into three plastic bags that are almost twice as big as the empty plastic box they give to hold the wipes. So now I have half a bag, that was already ripped, drying out. I guess I'll just put it in a plastic ziplock. Disappointed.	&&&
Pampers wipes are by far the best wipes I have used. I watched children before I had my own and saw how other wipes treated childrens skin. When I had my daughter, they gave me Pampers wipes and diapers to start out with. She will be two this month and I have never had issues with them. My daughter got a rash one time when I thought to save some money and buy a cheaper brand. Big mistake! Instant redness, way harsh, and just bad. Neve r again! Pampers wipes are soft, thick, and take care of a tough job with gentle care!	&&&
"Good product and very safety. Pleasant smell and very soft. Good to everyone. Interested to buy every month.
Excellent product."	&&&
I like them, I use it to clean the pump.	&&&
Very soft and theyeven have a great scent! Don't have to use multiple wipes when cleaning a dirty diaper	&&&
I purchased these for my kids to use and will probably go back to baby wipes (that have to be put into the trash) when these are gone. The wipes are a little flimsy. THe packaging allows them to dry out pretty quickly if you don't use the package up within 2 weeks or so, and if you add water to rehydrate them they get even flimsier and start to break down almost like wet toilet paper. Not impressed.	&&&
"OK, I don't have kids. I think kids suck. But I bought these anyway, and I bought them because I'm cheap.

Do you have a Swiffer? Ever noticed that Swiffer pads are a rip off? Well, buy these instead! Stretch one of these bad boys over the Swiffer and voila! a redneck Swiffer pad.

I also just generally use them to clean small spills, etc., on my floors."	&&&
They smell pretty good and they are very soft. However, they rip apart very easily and while changing a big, stubborn poopy, it can be gross to have wipes ripping all over the place.	&&&
Absorbs more than any other dog diaper I have tried. Good fit without being too right. Great for older male dogs or marking dogs. Just wish they were cheaper. Go through them quickly with older dog. Great product. Stays on through a smart tape-like, but better system. Appears to lock with other than adhesive. The best!!!	&&&
These are my favorite wipes of all time. Great scent, durable and soft for baby's skin.	&&&
Good for your baby. Super moist. Last long. Sometimes hard to pull out but such is the nature of all wipes.	&&&
"These are great natural wipes.
They are very gentle. My baby has not had any diaper rash since we started using these.
I highly recommend them."	&&&
Good product. Good quality product, and it does not jam up the toilets. Could be a bit cheaper or have more quantity.	&&&
I love these wipes they come in handy especially when you want to freshen up or just for general use instead of toilet paper while on period "	&&&
Bought these for a friend for her baby shower. Soft and perfect for wiping baby's bottom (or your own!). Comes with a tub to just constantly refill. Would recommend to anyone!	&&&
"What can I say about having a clean ""bum!"" It's WONDERFUL! I was previously using baby wipes but they aren't easily disposable or flushable which made them less attractive to me, as I try to be conscious of my carbon footprint.

This product is FANTASTIC! There's no heavy scent. They are large enough to cover the ""bum"" region efficiently and they don't tear or fall apart.

Since I was able to purchase this product on sale; the savings were substantial.

The dispenser is quite attractive; it has a lovely subtle design on the cover and it came with a hanging clip. I haven't used the hanging clip because I store my dispenser in my locker at work.

This product is handy, dandy, and my ""bum"" is sweet as candy.""}},"	&&&
The wipes are dry but you are supposed to add water. I got a dermatologica facial and this was a must. It really helped hydrate my skin and it already felt great without any more product. If there is not enough wipes for you try the liquid version	&&&
This is the only makeup remover wipe that I have found that doesn't irritate my skin. With other wipes, the skin around my eyes was getting puffy and red and it was painful. I was about to give up on the convenience of a wipe when I found these. They are a little more expensive than other wipes out there but completely worth it. I'm a customer for life!	&&&
I was looking for soft baby cleansing cloths for wiping my baby soft skin as cloth was too rough on our baby sensitive skin. This product is similar to the one hospital gave us.Overall we are very happy with the purchase.	&&&
These wipes have a nice mild scent and it's gentle on my newborn son's bottom.	&&&
LOVE these wipes. We used pampers, huggies naturals and even all other kinds but there really clean the best and leave no redness afterwards. We use them for the face, bottom, hands, etc. bc they don't have chemicals. Highly recommend! I'm sorry it took us this long to find these-3rd kid.	&&&
I really love the wipes. They are easy for little and big messes.	&&&
Love the Clorox wipes. Use them in every room of my house.	&&&
The wipes clean are great to use throughout the home.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the most convenient cleaning item. You can just grab one, wipe what you need to and go. Thanks you for such great product.	&&&
They are the best wipes from a name that we know and trust.	&&&
Love clorox disinfecting wipes! We really go through the stuff in our household.	&&&
I use clorox wipes every day. Great for quick clean ups.	&&&
I use it to increase the longevity of my open packages of face cleansing wipes. It's a bit difficult to open one handed (like you'd want for baby wipes and wiggly babies) but perfect for what I use it for.	&&&
These wipes smell fresh and leave the surface clean and bright!	&&&
It seems like messes pop up when you least expect them. Its so handy to have Clorox wipes right there to help.	&&&
These wipes have a light, fresh scent and even my kids who have very sensitive skin do not react negatively to these wipes. They are hands down my favorite.	&&&
The Clorox Disinfecting wipes are very easy to use! Leaves a good clean smell after each use.	&&&
I like Clorox wipes because they easy to use and they do not leave behind any residue when you are done. Also they are safe to use to clean some electronics.	&&&
These wipes leave a fresh scent and a clean feeling after wiping surfaces. They are easy to use to clean up spills, messes or dirty countertops. Love them!	&&&
Clorox wipes is a good product to clean your surfaces and know that they are disinfected.	&&&
I have used these wipes since my first child. They are great. So soft and not too wet and dense like most other wipes. The one con is that in a wipes warmer they tend to dry out or if they are in anything but the perfectly sealed package they also can dry up quickly but other than that these wipes are perfect. They are so soft and gentle and smell great. I would never use another brand or type. Thanks pampers for being so soft on my babies bums!	&&&
I LOVE these wipes. They're sensitive and soft enough for my baby's little bottom yet strong enough to get the job done. Good for other uses besides baby's bottom as well, I use these wipes for everything!	&&&
With 3 boys in the house, cleaning the bathroom is never a fun task. But with clorox wipes my job is SO much easier and I feel like things get SO much cleaner than with the alternative methods. I cant live without them.	&&&
The Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are great! They are my go-to for wiping down the kitchen counters. They are also handy for cleaning door handles and light switches.	&&&
clorox has been used for many many years so dont need to prove anything t me when it comes to wipes. the wipes is the best you can find out there.	&&&
I have a large dog rescue, and clorox wipes work in a quick need!	&&&

Clorox wipes are so great!They are easy to use and i feel better knowing that I'm doing all I can to keep my family safe.	&&&
I love the convenience and guarantee of a disinfected bathroom when I use Clorox wipes.	&&&
We love this product at work. We use it several times a day especially during flu season because I work in a 24 hour shift work job where colds and illness spread like wildfire. These wipes help minimize the the risk of getting sick while at work.	&&&
I love the smell of the lemon wipes. I use them in the kitchen and bathroom. They make the rooms smell fresh, and I know that they are killing germs.	&&&
Absolutely love these wipes. I use them for multiple reasons daily!	&&&
I love these handy wipes! They make everything I clean smell fresh. I keep a container in every room to make clean up simple and quick. With lots of kids I have lots of messes. A quick swipe on doors/knobs, wall spots and toys helps keep germs at bay. Love them!	&&&
This is a great product especially for a full time working mom. It makes clean up a breeze and I can rest assured that things are really clean after I use it. I have a daughter who is severely allergic to peanuts so we use the wipes all the time to clean the space to protect her from having an anaphylactic reaction. Thanks Clorox!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They are so easy to use and still clean everything I need. Cleaning is no longer a hassle.	&&&
Love the wipes, everything is clean and it saves time!	&&&
I enjoy these wipes, because they are so easy for my kids to wipe down the bathroom sink and toilet. They get their chores done in no time!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes in my classroom everyday to help prevent my darling students from sharing their germs. They are easy to grab at the end of the day and quickly wipe down all surfaces. It helps me to feel confident that everything has been disinfected and is ready for another great day of learning.	&&&
I use the wipes when i am doing a quick clean up. I especially love using them in the bathroom where there is always some sort of mess from my boys.	&&&
Clorox® Disinfecting Wipes (Lemon) are a great product. Cleans well, smells good, and disinfects so I know germs are not spread around the house!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes EVERY WHERE. Maybe I'm lazy but it's Clorox's fault for making something so convenient to use when there's a dirty spot somewhere.	&&&
Love the convenience of Clorox wipes. It really helps with my 5 year old twins!	&&&
I use disinfecting wipes for everything! I love these!	&&&

A STAPLE in my home! I love these wipes and since they have improved the formula, they can wipe any surface, no streaks!	&&&
Wonderful products. Use nothing but Clorox in this house. With 2 children under the age of 3. We always have kids that are sick. So we use Clorox wipes on a daily basis.	&&&
I love these wipes!! They are so convenient and easy to use.	&&&
I have been using Clorox Wipes since they came out and I have to say that I love them. There is nothing easier than just grabbing a wipe to clean up a quick spill or clean your stove after cooking dinner.	&&&
Great smell and hydrating wipes to go anywhere with you. Living in sunny CA, my lips get dry or need refreshing. These wipes do a great job.	&&&
I LOVE Clorox Disinfecting wipes! They make cleaning so much easier!	&&&
I have used Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for years. They are so convenient and great for most messes.	&&&
I loved these wipes as did my son! They are a great quality and were ultra strong. With any newborn you want something that is going to go the distance. It needs to be strong, absorbent, and not cause any problems and these Pampers wipes fit that bill to the letter. My son has very sensitive skin, and it doesn't take much to give him a diaper rash, but these have been AMAZING we haven't had a problem! We haven't been using them long, but as long as things keep going this way, we will probably stick to these wipes for a VERY long time. My only complaint is that there weren't more in the box!	&&&
Love clorox wipes! They make cleaning and disinfecting my house so easy!	&&&
It's really great and its easy to use! I usually tell my 11 year to grab the wipes to help me clean the counters, i don't have to worry that she will bleach her clothes.	&&&
So easy to use! I love how convenient these wipes are. They smell so fresh and clean!	&&&
I like clorox wipes because they are easy to use, and I can get my daughter to help me clean with them.	&&&
"Love that this container holds all wipes well in place . I believe this tub is more Sanatary to use as you don't have to have to dig with your fingers through the Huggies refillable box .. The weight on this product that holds the wipes down has a nice large opening and no longer have to dig for wipes ."	&&&
We love These wipes. My nieces have sensitive skin and as their nanny I always wanted the best for them. They never got rash or red. The wipes are thick and really get the job done.	&&&
"Lysol wipes are very handy in our office. We like to keep things as germ free
as possible and these wipes fit the bill. I appreciate them even more when they
are on sale.""}},"	&&&
We love huggies wipes! These are slightly thinner than the other huggies wipes, but for the price I was willing sacrifice a little quality. They are still better than Pampers, just not as thick as the original huggies wipes.	&&&
I bought these wipes in hope of finding something a little more sensitive for my babies behind. She had developed a diaper rash from other name brand wipes so I wanted to try these and see what kind of reaction she would have to them. Well we loved them! Within a day or so her rash had cleared up and her little behind was pain free! The natural, fragrance free aspect of these wipes made them amazing and delicate which is important for newborn skin.	&&&
I love the quality and convenience of Clorox wipes. I use them to clean countertops in the kitchen and bathroom. With all of the germs being passed around, and especially during cold and flu season, they are a MUST. I use them to clean my daughter's locker at school and the desktops in her classroom. There is no substitute for these wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are a favorite for quick-cleanups at home and a necessity for traveling.	&&&
I love the Clorox bleach wipes because I have messy kids. I'm always wiping up some kind of sticky mess and I love that the wipes cut through the grease and stickiness. I also appreciate the peace of mind knowing that my counters are cleaner than before with the germ-killing properties of the wipes.	&&&
This product is wonderful, i have tried many other products but pampers sensitive wipes are the best they are gentle and strong wipes. I buy the box of seven pack and its really affordable. They are great for kids who are allergic of fragrance theydo great on my baby.	&&&
These wipes are good. They're not the best. They are not that plush and soft. They aren't as big as some other huggies wipes. They are sort of a basic version of the regular huggies which is still far better than most other wipe brands. They get the job done. They are very gentle. I use them for myself for a variety of reasons. They are great at removing makeup. They are gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin. The wipe count and price is nice. It's a very good deal. I would buy these again. Just don't expect these to be premium, luxurious wipes. They are more of a basic wipe.	&&&
"Bought these a day before my water frozed. I wanted to cleaned and remembered I had bought these wipes. I was so amazed how they cleaned up my kitchen cabinets and stove. I then, began to take them in to the restrooms and cleaned the cabinets and even the toilets with them. This wipes are very durable and pick up anything. I was so thankful for them and how they made my day with frozen water, but a clean house. The sad thing was is that it was the last pack Staples had on the shelve. but now the weather is warming up and I have water, I am going back to hopefully find more..... thank you so much."	&&&
I love the ease of the disinfecting wipes and the smell after using them.	&&&
These wipes are convenient to use and disinfects at the sametime!	&&&
Clorox wipes are the ideal product in our home. We use in all wet areas because they are quick, easy and super reliable. Love them!	&&&
We have a puppy who is still not completely potty trained -- Clorox wipes are the answer to her misses!	&&&
With 5 kids these wipes keep my home germ free without breaking my back or the bank!!!	&&&
I use Clorox disinfecting wipes for almost everything, especially cleaning and disinfecting my child's toys.	&&&
With two small toddlers, Clorox wipes makes cleaning up messes easy. Great product!	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox wipes and use them everyday to clean up any type of mess and wipe away germs.	&&&
Love Clorox disinfecting wipes, especially during this crazy flu season, it really eases my mind knowing I can easily disinfect every surface in my house. Aside from trying to eliminate germs, I love wiping my counters down after handling raw meat, even if it doesn't visibly get on the counter, still eases my mind to wipe them down and eliminate any bacteria.	&&&
With two toddler boys, Clorox wipes come in handy to clean up any mess.	&&&
We just moved in to a not so clean home which even had my skeptical husband asking for wipes!	&&&
lemon clorox wipes are easy to use. I USE TO CEAN AND DISINFECT my kitchen and bathroom.	&&&
I would recommend this product to anyone because of its easy use and the container for the wipes are easy to use.	&&&
I love the wipes they are a very good I use them at work.	&&&
"""These wipes as very small and thin; consequently, I had to use six individual pieces just to wipe off the white board once. You can imagine how many I had to use during my 1 1/2 hour class! At this rate, the bottle will be empty by the end of the week!



Further, the ""pop"" function does not work properly. The only way I can get the wipes off the role is to uncap the bottle, take out the role, and pull the wipes off one at a time like a role of paper towels.



This product has potential, but I think it currently needs to be sent back to the invention room."""	&&&
I love these wipes which have no ingredient other than water. My twins are now 6- months old and have never had a diaper rash. I use them for diaper changes as well as wiping mouths after eating, cleaning hands, etc. and never worry about what chemicals I'm exposing them to, because there are none in these. Just a small but important one less worry for mommy. Could we make our own since they are just water and it seems ridiculous to pay for water wipes? Absolutely, but for the price I find these are way more convenient, especially when purchased in bulk like this.	&&&
I sometimes use baby fresh wipes with my boy when we don't find sensitive wipes. We really like it.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. So convenient and they work great!!	&&&
Love the clorox wipes for the kitchen! Fast and easy to clean up the counters after meals and snacks. Smells fresh and clean.	&&&
I don't normally buy "cleaning wipes" but these are really good for all kinds of things like electronics and computers. They leave hardly any reside and have a very slight, not unpleasant oder.	&&&
Clorox wipes give a reliable clean every time. Easy to use and one wipe goes far.	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes They are amazing. I use them in my kitchen, car, office and just around the house. I love the crisp scent they leave /	&&&
This is the first time I tried them. Very happy with these wipes. Strong, get the job done, like the unscented option.	&&&
I first discovered wipes like these while on vacation. I usually use a liquid cleanser but these made washing and refreshing the face easy. They are not exfoliating but are just plain and simple makeup/ dirt removal wipes. They get the job done nicely. The way they are packaged keeps them fresh and from drying out if you close the flap. Overall I like them a lot and find them very handy.	&&&
ALL others gave him rashes.	&&&
These are great wipes! They are gentle on the skin!	&&&
I keep one pouch of the fresh scent boogie wipes in my car, And one of the grape scented boogie wipes in my diaper bag, You never know when you will need them. The cloths are large and smell great. My son doesn't mind when i use them either, Which is a bonus.	&&&
I've bought two of these now, and the white plastic latch on front, where the wipes come out, has fallen off both times. All the wipes end up drying out. I wouldn't reccomend this product.	&&&
I kept seeing the boogie wipes in store and thought why on earth someone would buy these when the could just use tissue....I wish I tried them sooner! My son loves them and they're perfect for the diaper bag!!	&&&
I purchased these Grape scented Boogie Wipes a month or so ago during my son's peak allergy period. For the first time ever, his nose didn't become raw from all the blowing AND because of the great Grape scent, he volunteered to blow his nose instead of me having to chase him down to do it! I'm already stockpiling these for the upcoming winter months! Thank you Boogie Wipes!	&&&
My son has sensitive skin and his nose gets easily irritated by tissues. Boogie wipes unscented does the trick!	&&&
We have been using Kandoo wipes since our oldest daughter was learning to wipe on her own. The wipes make sure she gets clean and fresh without worrying about toilet paper sticking to her.	&&&
I always buy these wipes for my kids. Love them and how they are soft and gentle enough for their noses wont get chapped	&&&
This clutch is perfect to toss into the diaper bag! I love that it is refillable and it is made from a stronger plastic so it doesn't feel like it could easily tear or become damaged while getting tossed around in the bag. I also was a huge fan of the cute prints that these were available in ( we have the one pictured )The little loop on the end with the snap is perfect for attaching to your bag so you can easily find the wipes when changing your little one.The only thing I wish was different is that the lid area was attached more securely. It has started to peel off (but nothing a dap of hot glue can't fix.)Other than that one issue, this has been a GREAT purchase for our diaper bag!	&&&
I like the wipes, but this flip top completely breaks off after a few uses. Dry wipes are a waste...	&&&
Seriously my favorite wipes. Forget huggies & pampers. I have twins and these were prefect for any little mess that came up!	&&&
These are great wipes and you can't beat the Amazon price. I tried a discount big box brand and I could immediately tell the difference, stay with the Pampers.	&&&
I have used Boogie Wipes for about 6 months now and my 22 month old has had 2 colds. She loves Boogie Wipes - not just the scent but softness on her little nose. I love that her nose doesn't get sore & crusty and that she doesn't fight me! I personally used them w that bad case of the flu last month & wow! Is all I can say!!!	&&&
We have been using Boogie Wipes since our 2 year old was born. They are the only wipes he let's us use on his nose. Now that he's older, he takes the wipe and wipes his own face...it's so cute!!	&&&
I learned about Boogie Wipes from a friend when my son had a cold. His poor nose and cheeks had become red and sore from tissues, so she suggested Boogie Wipes as a gentler choice. What a difference they made! My son's nose was able to heal and we were still able to get him to wipe and blow his nose as needed. Boogie Wipes are now a staple in our house. Thanks for such a quality product for all ages!	&&&
I wrote this review in hopes that it will make a difference. The new wipes are awful. The smell is horrible!!! The old wipes were PERFECT... Please change them back! There were no others like them!! PLEASE change them back!!!!	&&&
Great wipes & great price.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the easiest and fastest way to clean, sanitize, and deodorize - all in one wipe.	&&&
It's so important to have these if you have kids! It's easy to clean and disinfect with them, and the wipes are really convenient.	&&&
I love the ease or use of the disinfecting wipes. I use them for general cleanup after my baby and preschooler.	&&&
I love the ease of using these wipes. It is quick and has a very pleasant smell to go along with it!	&&&
I've tried several different "cleaning wipe" brands, and Clorox is the one I always wind up going back to. The container is sturdier than the others when you pull the wipes out (less breaking!) and it gets the job done. Plus, it isn't lightly moistened like some other brands are. I love it!	&&&
I love the ease of Clorox wipes! They are super convenient and I feel comfortable that they disinfect!	&&&
"These Huggies wipes work as expected.

I had to edit this review because I accidentally posted a review for Huggies snug and dry diapers which I was not thrilled with."	&&&
I cant imagine life without Clorox its part of my everyday life from the to go wipes to the bleach for laudry.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes leave everything smelling clean and fresh!	&&&
These are the best wipers I have found and the only wipes I will use! They don't have a chemical smell to them like so many other wipes have. They are the perfect amount of moist and soapy and they clean up any mess easily. Kirkland wipes are very affordable, the price is about what I was spending to make my own wipes. I don't have a Costco near me, so I order them. I don't know what I would do without Costco online!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes everyday. They are great for a quick cleanup!	&&&
Love everything Clorox. I know everything is clean and disinfected. Wipes off easily.	&&&
I have tried several wipes out there and these were the best match for me. The negative things I have about these is that they sometimes stick together when trying to remove them from my wipes holder and if they get too dried out then they leave little fibers on my child. Positively, they have great moisture, are durable, soft, don't leave a gross residue and don't rip when you try to get them out.	&&&
Absolutely love using Clorox around the house. The disinfecting wipes are convenient and work great.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes like they are going out of style! They are easy to use and do a great job!	&&&
They perform as expected in removing makeup, but nothing special. While I enjoy other products in the collection, the fragrance in the wipes was off-putting to me.	&&&
Only complaint is that the wipes can easily rip off into pieces. But they are otherwise soft and gentle for my baby's skin:)	&&&
I have the Well Beginnings Shea Butter Wipes & they smell fantastic and don't break my newborn's skin out at all. I usually buy unscented wipes but these wipes were given to me. They stay nice & wet	&&&
These Clorox wipes are wonderful! I use them in my classroom to clean the kids desks. It gets all of the icky grime off and leave this great lemony scent. I feel safe using these because they disinfect well. Go Clorox!	&&&
So happy to see Aveeno positively radiant makeup removing wipes. They are great my skin has never looked better or felt softer...... But the smell is sooooo strong it makes me sick..cross between very strong floral and bug spray... Just love the wipes please unscented or more crisp clean scent...PLEASE!	&&&
I use clorox wipes in my kitchen and bathroom on all surfaces and they work great!	&&&
Really like the wipes when I am in a hurry to clean the bathroom when unexpected guests arrive.	&&&
I love using Clorox to clean my kitchen, my living and bathroom. Best product to use especially the Clorox disinfecting wipes.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. As a germaphobe I can relax knowing that disinfecting everything has become so easy!!	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes have so many uses around the house. Whether it's in my kitchen, laundry room, bathroom or even car, I trust Clorox to clean and disinfect dirty areas. Love this product and continue to purchase over and over again.	&&&
I only bought in hopes of getting the limited Frozen wipes. I did not end up getting them. I would not recommend purchasing these if you are only looking to get the Frozen box of wipes.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes because I know things are getting clean! I love the smell of the room after using them too.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes constantly and always have at least three in my house	&&&
I always use the Clorox wipes for everything in my home. They are especially effective for the kitchen.	&&&
This product has been awesome. I use it to clean anything going into baby's mouth. Baby doesn't even hesitate due to a bad taste.	&&&
These are the best makeup wipes I've ever used. It gets all the foundation, eyeshadow, and even waterproof mascara off my face! I have very oily skin and these wipes don't have a greasy after effect and leave my skin feeling very moisturized. Would recommend to anyone!	&&&
These wipes reminded me of the cheap, store brand wipes they sell here. I know the ingredients are much better, but personally I very much prefer the 7 generation "Strong" free and clear baby wipes. These were true to word--very soft, but also very thin and stretchy...poop just went right through the wipe and all over my hands. Not. A. Fan.	&&&
Way too much fragrance! Irritated me. Can just imagine baby. Went into trash	&&&
These wipes are great. They clean up the kids with no problem and I love the scent!	&&&
I love these to take my makeup off.....	&&&
Why did I not know about these stainless still wipes before now? I have struggled with my stainless appliances since I got them 3 years ago, because I can never get them to look really clean and shiny. Until today. I just got these Weiman cleaning wipes, and in 2 minutes my fridge looked like it did when first delivered. I can't wait to clean the rest of my appliances! Ok, maybe that's a stretch since I'm not really that into cleaning, but at least now I know they'll look great in a fraction of the time I spent on them in the past!	&&&
They dried out quickly, and made my eyes water continuously until I washed my face. I didn't mind the left over residue, it made my face feel fresh. Cons over pros; I won't buy them again.	&&&
I recieved this product to try for free and after using them once, I'm hooked, and will continue to buy them	&&&
I've used these for a long time and I really like the convenience of them. The pop up container is really handy and the wipes do stay moist. I would like to see the wipes just a tiny bit larger but overall these do the job and I would recommend them.	&&&
Love these. Makes gum cleaning easy. 1 month old baby loves the flavor that she will actually suck on these if you let her. If you happen to live in Texas though, HEB has these packets for cheaper.	&&&
I have used these wipes for over 9 years on all my children. They are exactly what a mother wants on her child's bottom. They are thin, soft, scented and unscented, cost effective and work great. Against Huggies, they win hands down!	&&&
GREAT wipes - these are thicker and seem to work better than my other wipes from other brands I've tried. I was very impressed with these!	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes save so much time at my house. I feel better using these rather than a dish towel in the kitchen that may contain germs. Using yesterdays dish cloth is a good way to spread germs rather than clean. These wipes are easy to use and quick. The don't create any extra laundry it is reassuring that you are doing something safe and healthy for your family. They also do an amazingly good job of cleaning. I was convinced the first time I used these.	&&&
I use these daily to keep my glasses clean	&&&
Bought the boogie wipes to try for my kids since they dislike tissue paper and they love it and so do I. No lint and no roughness to their noses. Clean up is fast, just wipe and done.	&&&
This are great wipes and a trusted brand. This price is not bad, but would be nicer if it had a little more amount. Very moist and one wipe goes a long way. Very pleased with the purchase.	&&&
I bought these when they were on sale hoping that they would be my new go to wipes. They're just okay in my opinion. I'm not a fan of the scent at all, and if I ever had to buy them again I'd go for the unscented ones for sure. They aren't very thick, and I feel like I use more of these than the other brands I've used. I recently bought some at Sams Club and love them so much more, They are thick and quilted, and do a much better job than these. Like I said, these are just okay. For the price though, I think there are much better options.	&&&
Love these wipes! They work great on white counters.	&&&
i like the wipes cause they are easy to use and handy to keep in all the roooms in the houw	&&&
Best wipes EVER!! I totally love this product. Thank you CLOROX! I would really recommend this product.	&&&
I really like the canister wipes...easy to use and very convenient for quick mess clean-up!	&&&
When the flu comes around I run and get my clorox wipes. It's easy to use and a must have to kill the cooties.	&&&
I use a lot of wipes and this is the best smelling one with the best results, along with the biggest bang for my buck!	&&&
Clorox wipes helps with reducing germs and I use them on an everyday basics.	&&&
I absolutely love these baby wipes! Probably the absolute best brand and scent on the market today. It definitely takes less to clean up messes whether it be when changing diapers or faces. I love the deals I can find on Amazon too for wipes!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They are easy to use, lemon scent smells great and they are convenient!	&&&
These wipes are great - one and done for 90% of the changes (sometimes there is no avoiding using a ton of wipes, no matter what brand). They are soft and gentle on her skin as well which is great. Never leave home without them!	&&&
"Even though cold weather usually kills germs, the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes is a great value as well as an outstanding cleaning and disinfecting product for home or the workplace. These wipes can clean anything, anywhere as well as keep you, your family and your home germ free. Even in the workplace these wipes are outstanding for keep your workplace clean and smelling fresh.

I absolutey love clorox disinfecting wipes! I use them all over my home, but I especially like to use them on my kitchen countertops. They make cleaning so easy!	&&&
loved the product very easy to use my kids love to do chores when they can use the wipes	&&&
These are great wipes. They work so well and they are thick enough to clean up messes but soft enough for any baby. I love the cotton softness of this wipe.	&&&
i like the convenience that the wipes offer me when i spill something, they are easy to use and quick to grab and use too. i like that the disenfect and leave my house feeling nice and fresh snd clean when i use them. they could be a little cheaper though.	&&&
During Christmas we had a neighbor who had given my grandchildren some used toys.I wiped each of them down with the Clorox wipes just to be on the safe side.The kids loved the toys and I had peace of mind!	&&&
I love using Boogie Wipes. The grape sent is really great, soft and gentle on my son's nose and face. Boogie wipes are not harsh and work great to get the crusty boogies out of my son's nose.	&&&
I have a container of wipes in every bathroom, my kitchen, garage and even keep one in the car. We use them all of the time!	&&&
I like the Clorox disinfecting wipes for quick small clean ups. I keep a canister under my kitchen sink, and each of the bathrooms.	&&&
I love how fresh the wipes leave everything smelling and how convenient it is to pull one out and POOF the mess is gone and disinfected! Thank you Clorox for being so AMAZING!!!!!	&&&
"For some reason, it feels kinda sticky after use.

Aside from that, it wipes things down clean and good to know it kills germs."	&&&
These wipes come to my rescue all the time, for quick clean ups or spot cleaning that continues on to the whole house.	&&&
We have white counter tops and they stain easy, almost nothing works better than Clorox wipes.	&&&
I purchased this item online. It was priced well and it shipped very quickly. These wipes are very convenient and I use them all the time when cleaning the kitchen. I also have a toddler who loves to create messes. These are the perfect items to clean up after my child. They clean and sterilize with one swipe and last a long time. The container that they are stored in is easy to use. I received the wipes about three weeks ago and it is almost time for me to reorder. I recommend this product!"}},	&&&
These wipes are very convenient and i use them a lot at work. Kills germs!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because they are so convenient and easy to use. I have several bottles in various locations throughout my house..simple and easy!	&&&
I love Clorox brand cleaning supplies. You can find the wipes in each bathroom and under our kitchen sink. Makes for both a quick clean up while disinfecting too. The wipes and Clorox bleach is a staple in our home. Thanks for making such great products that work!!	&&&
Use clorox wipes everyday. Great for disinfecting.	&&&
Clorox Wipes are so convenient and get the job done!	&&&
The packaging has changed on the wipes and now stink...like something metallic. I would not recommend this new iteration, but the previous Kirkland wipes were great. Too bad	&&&
Wipes are convenient for easy use for baby and I. Love hanging them in the car or just throwing them around the living room with the clutter of toys!	&&&
Cleaning up after dinner prep is VERY easy since we started using Clorox Wipes. We are assured nasty pork and chicken bacteria are gone when we use these wipes, unlike when we simply wiped up with a soapy rag. For pesky stains (when we miss a spot of tomato sauce or coffee) we spray with Clorox spray and let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe away.	&&&
As a mother of 5, I use disinfectant wipes often. These are handy to wipe down the stair railings, remotes, phones and keep some in the car to wipe off the steering wheel and door. As with just about every pop up wipe container though, I wish there was a better way to make them come out easier at the beginning and the end. Its always a struggle to get them started and at the end they all come out out at once and they are dripping wet.	&&&
"The price was right and I'm not above using store brand products, but what was unfortunate was it only worked with their brand diaper wipes. It did not specify that on the box only in the instruction manual AFTER I ruin several of my own diaper wipes. I thought it was ""user error"" but it was the wrong wipes.
That is unfortunate and not very convenient."	&&&
"I use Clorox Wipes on EVERYTHING! They are a quick and easy way to clean things up in a pinch.
They are also on the list of school supplies for my kids school, so they LOVE them too!!"	&&&
Love clorox disinfecting wipes for every day use in the bathroom, kitchen, and anywhere else messes are made! I also use them at the office..especially with all the sickness going on!	&&&
I love the disinfectant wipes. Makes jobs so easy and I know it's getting the surface truly clean of germs. So easy even my kids use them with their chores.	&&&
I really love the way the Clorox bleach wipes takes care of every dirty job.	&&&

Easy to use. Disinfects and cleans great. The wipes are conveniant I use them daily to wipe down washroom. They are great in the kitchen too.	&&&
We've used only Pampers wipes since our son was born. He was in the NICU for 2 wks. When we brought him home we only used pampers sensitive wipes since that is what they used in the NICU. My son is three now and we won't use anything else but Pampers wipes.	&&&
Love the Disinfecting Wipes and the Lemon Smell. Makes the office and the house feel so clean.	&&&
I like the wipes. I take them to work and use all the time. In an office this helps to keep the germs down. It cleans great.	&&&
I like the sensitive wipes. They're nothing special but unscented and thick enough for big messes. These boxes are ONLY refills and have the pull tab on it for you to put in the white boxes. They don't come with boxes so make sure you already have some or purchase another set.	&&&
this is great so that my daughters have the items that they use at home here when they visit me.	&&&
I wear heavy makeup nearly every day! These wipes are made from magic! I can get most of my makeup off with just half of one wipe, that includes all of my waterproof makeup. They don't irritate my skin, which usually causes redness but they just do their job. I don't typically need to wash with cleanser afterwards. Magic I tell ya! Magic!	&&&
I've been trying out Huggies wipes over competitor brands and I have to say, they do clean pretty well and they are very soft and the scent is amazing! They are not quite as strong as some other brands though. Wish Huggies would do something about that, and then I'd be sold 100%.	&&&
These wipes are my favorites, and after having four babies, I can say I'm a discerning user of baby wipes! They are thick, not too wet, and do the job without getting my hands dirty.	&&&
I inherited a 2006 Acura that had been well broken-in - that includes some dried, stained leather seats. After a couple coats of the leather conditioner, the seats look almost brand new. Definitely a product I will continue to use and recommend!	&&&
These were too soft to get a good wipe. I used way more wipes than normal because of this. They didn't seem to separate very well when used with my container.	&&&
Perfect for guys who travel, or are on the road a lot. Discreet, not bulky like a ten pack. 30 pack is perfect, don't have to buy many boxes.	&&&
"We love the softness and scent of this product.
We keep these wipes everywhere!"	&&&
My daughter and her partner think the Bumkins wipes are the best of any they've tried. They'll be the only ones from now on.	&&&
We don't trust any other baby wipe for our sweet one's bum. They always get the job done and there has never been an adverse reaction with these wipes. Perfect size and thickness.	&&&
Pampers wipes are probably my second choice of wipes. My first choice is Huggies only because they seem thicker and stronger. The Pampers wipes are while they are strong, they are thin but my least favorite part about them is they leave a greasy residue or something on my fingers.	&&&
I just received this item and set it up. The warmer unit is decent. The wipies have not dried out and are nice and warm. The problem is the built in "night light". There is no way to turn this light off and it is so bright that it lights up the entire room! I have emailed the company re this issue but have yet to get a reply. If you want a reading light on while your child sleeps then, by all means, purchase this unit. But if you would rather decide for yourself if you want/ ;need a night light then save yourself the money and trouble. I might switch back to disposable wipes and my old warmer from my first born.	&&&
best wipes for newborns! Soft and gentle yet strong enough to clean the biggest of messes!	&&&
I love huggies wipes they are the best. You dont have to use alot of them like you do with other wipes.	&&&
Again these wipes compared to other brands and in particular huggies are wonderful. They do not rip when you pull them out of the containers. They are super soft and smell good. Other brands are hard and rip. Really annoying when you have a poopy diaper and the wipe rips!	&&&
the quality of the wipes is amazing. it really clean off all the dirt making the skin feel fresh	&&&
Lysol wipes are so needed in every house hold, office, and classroom. Whether you have kids or not.I have a bottle in my bathroom, kitchen, living room, office and my car. At home I have a 3 year old boy and he is messy, especially when he uses the bathroom. I'm constantly using my Lysol wipes in the bathroom, whether it cleaning the toilet, wiping the floors or the sink. I also use my Lysol wipes to wipe my kitchen counter and stove. if my son spills juice on the floor I use lysol wipes to clean it up. it is amazing!"}},	&&&
I absolutley love clorox wipes and i use them everyday	&&&
I like how easy the clorox wipes are to use for a quick clean up. Also that the products kill germs and leave a fresh smell.	&&&
I always have Clorox wipes and spray available during flu season -	&&&
I really recommend Clorox disinfecting wipes because they are of really good value and easy to use. love them	&&&
I use the wipes in the bathroom for everyday cleaning. It is awesome!!	&&&
"I love the fact that I don't have to get in my tanning bed every time i want to tan. These towelettes are so easy to use and are just the right size. I thought I was going to have to worry about having stained hands, but that was not the deal with these. Actually, they looked just like diaper wipes, no color and no scent.

I love the fact that these DO NOT instantly give you an automatic dark tan,but gradually tans you as you use these towelettes. Thermalabs stated that 1 in 1,000 may not see results, but they back their product up 100% guarantee if they do not work with your body's own amino acids.

These also, DO NOT leave an orange result look. You get more of a natural tan with these wipes and that is what I love about these towelettes! You use only 1-2 wipes and if you need to re-apply to get a little more tone, wait 4 hours and apply 1 more towelette. Once you get your desired tone, you then have to use 1-2 towelettes every one to two weeks to maintain."	&&&
I love these wipes they are convenient for cleaning up quick messes and leave my counter tops looking great. I love them for cleaning up the play areas to disinfect so that all the germs from the kids are wiped away.	&&&
Love how the wipes can clean up a mess and just be thrown away!	&&&
I use clorox wipes throughout my home. It cleans and disinfects.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes and fully trust that they will disinfect whatever I am cleaning.	&&&
I keep these wipes in the kitchen and their great to use when I need to wipe the counter down and I'm in a hurry. If I spill something or stain the counter and use one of these wipes it seems to take care of the stain.	&&&
"They are an all purpose sanitizing wipes – they kind of remind me of Lysol – but they don’t smell like chemicals – which is great!

They clean very well – and very quickly – it certainly has made cleaning my counters (both kitchen and bathroom) much easier. They have even helped me with my stove top (it’s a glass top and I know there is a special cleaner for that) but I’ve recently started with these wipes and I polish it off with the special cleaner.

PLUS these wipes also can work on your hands as well – it contains vitamin E so it doesn’t dry out your hands as much as the regular hand sanitizer you get in the pumps/bottles. These are great to have in your car (although the tub they are in is kind of on the larger size to just be floating around a car)."	&&&
I love these clorox wipes because their easy and quick while thoroughly cleansing.	&&&
I enjoy that I can use one cleaner, the clorox wipes. They clean so many things and knowing that it cleans and disinfects everything makes my job easier as a mom. I go through the cleaning wipes quickly because they are so nice and handy to use.	&&&
We have been using these wipes for several months now and couldn't love them more! We are very happy with them and will continue to buy them in the future.	&&&
I always send this clorox wipes to my sons school teachers love them	&&&
I could not live without Clorox Wipes. I clean everything with them. they are much more convienient and healthy than a dish rag or sponge.	&&&
You can''t beat the convenience and ease of use of Clorox wipes. I keep a stock in my bathrooms, kitchen and classroom!	&&&
I love the smell of the wipes and they are so easy to use. Always convenient to grab out of the container.	&&&
The wipes smells good, easy to use and disinfects whatever you use it on.	&&&
"I used to buy these Heavy Duty wipes at ShopRite (the only local store which carried them). A few months ago ShopRite stopped carrying them. I was glad to see the they were available via Amazon. However, the product has changed - and not for the better. They are now flimsy and smaller than before and less absorbent. Not in any stretch of the imagination are they ""heavy duty"".

For 20+ years I used these wipes as my dish clothes. When, after weeks of use in the kitchen, I relegated them to other household cleaning uses, then tossed them when they wore out. These wipes were far superior to and easier to keep clean than traditional ""REAL"" nasty dish clothes.

I doubt I'll buy the ""new"" and ""not improved"" Clorox Heavy Duty ""Handi Wipes"" again. I would prefer Clorox would increase the price, rather than make a cheaper and inferior product."	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best! you can safely use them anywhere, and on any surface. I always use this brand.	&&&
love the wipes but the lid always seems to break off the canister	&&&
I love the convenience of these wipes. They work better than any other disinfecting wipe I've used to clean up everyday messes.	&&&
I like the convenience of the wipes, just pull and wipe the countertops down. I am a clean freak so it eases my mind to know that it disinfects.	&&&

I love the convenience and quality of clorox wipes. I can just pull them out and use them.	&&&
I keep Clorox Disinfecting Wipes (and a few plastic gloves) in my car, and when my young children have to use a public bathroom, I wipe down the toilet seat, sink handles and dryer (if paper towels aren't available).	&&&
The clorox wipes are so easy to use and smell so great that I use them every day!	&&&
i love cleaning my bathroom with these wipes, they are my fav!	&&&
They are bigger, not little bitty wipes. Right size to take to a family gathering or you sneaked some bar-b-q in the car.	&&&
My husband uses the Clorox Fresh wipes to clean the grill before he cooks. He says they do an excellent job in removing the grime and dirt.	&&&
Clorox wipes are tough on grease and tough stains. Great for quick countertop clean ups.	&&&
With 2 little kids, my house is always a mess. These are the only wipes that I will buy and use for my family to clean up messes and get my house germ free.	&&&
Love huggies wipes	&&&
I love these wipes. I use them in my kitchen and bathroom. it is so convenient. I just grab, wipe and throw away. Perfect cleaner.	&&&
Love this. Used those plastic click ones forever and all the wipes would dry out. Found these at Target--had my favorite wipes in them anyway. Never dries out, easy to refill.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! Using only one cleans up my entire kitchen!	&&&
Love using Clorox wipes for quick cleanups and disinfecting everything with convenience	&&&
These wipes are so easy and convenient to use. Whenever my kids are sick, I keep these close to wipe down everything. Even when no one is sick, they are a great cleaning tool. We use them all the time at our house.	&&&
These are my absolute favorite wipes. They are soft and gentle. Compared to any other wipes, Pampers are top notch!	&&&
I like these because they are relatively non-toxic for wipes (per ewg). While not the most eco-friendly choice, they are helpful to have on hand for the frequent spills of a toddler!	&&&
These wipes are great to clean with, I use them everyday! They are very convenient as well! I trust the Clorox brand and will continue to use them.	&&&
Now that my kids are back in school for 2015, I sent both of them back with Clorox Disinfecting wipes! They are a much needed item in the classroom during flu season!!	&&&
I have tried other brands of disinfecting wipes other than Clorox. They just don't get the job done as well as Clorox. They are easy to used and great for all around the house.	&&&
I love these wipes! Makes clean up so easy and I don't have to dirty up all my kitchen towels in the process. Thank you!	&&&
love these wipes. They are so covienent. Plust disinfecting is made easy	&&&

I prefer using disinfecting wipes to rags, or sponges.	&&&
I love how easy it is to keep my family healthier by using Clorox wipes! Simple and convenient!!	&&&
When flu season hits Clorox wipes are our go to at home and at work.	&&&
These tear waaaay too easily! They are also less moist than the Pampers so you have to use more of them. Then there is the packaging, there are way too many wipes in each plastic package! Even after separating one pack into three different containers, the containers are packed so full that they don't completely close.	&&&
I keep Clorox Wipes in every bathroom so I can keep things clean and disinfected in less than a minute!	&&&
"Clorox wipes are great with kids. Disinfects and easy to use.
Love that I can disinfect quickly when someone is sick and also makes cleaning up the kitchen easy to do each night. The only negative Is that I think they are kind of picey"	&&&
I use Clorox wipes daily on my door knobs and surfaces. They are excellent and very convenient.	&&&
I use these wipes on a daily basics. As soon as I walk into my kitchen I pull them out. I got them in every room in my home! Call me a clean freak but I can't stand the thought of a lot of germs on my things. I was so happy when these were made & brought to us.	&&&
The clorox wipes have made cleaning up easier and convenient	&&&
Clorox wipes are convenient to use and smell good, even though they are disinfecting wipes. I do wish they were more durable, a bit thicker and a little more abrasive. They are a bit too soft in my opinion.	&&&
I love the purity of these wipes, but wish they weren't so expensive.	&&&
I love the ease and convenience of Clorox wipes. They make cleaning up my kitchen and bathrooms a breeze.	&&&
I have always preferred the cloth-like thickness and softness of Huggies baby wipes over other brands. We use them at dinner table, in the car, and in home office/toy room although my kids are out of diapers. I love these new containers because they are prettier and don't scream "baby bums are washed with these" when we have them sitting in places. They do get dirty on the outside, don't hold very many wipes, and aren't want to last forever, but the aesthetics are a great improvement. I'll buy again for the containers, even though it's not the best value.	&&&
i use these wipes to clean everything - including the floor!	&&&
Clorox wipes are handy to have around the house. I have found them to work well on our light carpet--although always test a spot on your carpet, because it may leave a bleach spot. I keep a container in the bathroom for a quick clean when needed.	&&&
"My wife and I were very fortunate to receive a lot of wipes for our baby shower. This being our first child, little did we know what to expect...

We had been using huggies brand wipes until my brother-in-law sent me a link saying that Amazon was getting into the diaper and wipe business. I was not hesitant at all to try them out.

We placed our first order for a pack of 9, we ordered the one that comes with a free dispenser. When they arrived we immediately started to use them and I can tell you that there is a huge difference with these wipes!!! These wipes are strong yet soft. They do not tear easily but are soft enough to wipe our newborns face without worrying about it scratching her. They are also super absorbent! I have actually left a wipe or two outside the container to dry out and use them as dry wipes when the baby spits up. Perfect for cleaning up her spit up!

We quickly went through the pack of 9 (babies are messy) and re-ordered another pack of 9. In a short amount of time my wife and I have tried 4-5 different brand of wipes and they all fall short of these Amazon Elements Baby Wipes. I cannot see myself buying any other brand.

Only thing I would have to say is that they few bottom wipes at the end of the pack as extremely moist! Maybe too much to even be used. But that's understandable and by no means any reason to not buy these wipes again!"	&&&
Love the wipes! The only brand I purchase for the family!!!!!	&&&
love the chlorox wipes. I feel the surface is very clean after using. Stops the spread of bacteria that makes me and my family sicik.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes (Lemon) gets the job done! Love the lemon scent.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. They smell great, and I have had water marks, or other stains on my counters that wouldn't come off with different cleaners. I have a tube in every room in my house, and 2 in the dog room. They are convenient, and helpful for any mess.	&&&
I love to have the wipes handy at all times for the spills my 4 year old makes!	&&&
Definately recommend these wipes, i love them and so does my toddler and baby only wipes they dont conplain about.	&&&
I am a huge fan of clorox wipes and love to disinfect my home with them and use them everywhere in the house and my car. I use them to wipe handles down and use them in local stores to disinfect carts. I am very worried about germs and try to use them in the bathroom and kitchen the most. These are quick and handy and eliminate me using and wasting water	&&&
I have used cottenelle wipes but something caused skin irritation. So far Costco's brand seems more gentle and non-irritating	&&&
I have used Costco wipes since my kids were born and have always loved them. But in my most recent purchase something has changed, new formula or something and the smell is very off putting. The smell even lingers on my hands after I wash them. They now smell like all the cheap generic wipes out there that I have always hated due to the smell. Costco please go back to your old formula...please!!	&&&
I love the clorox wipes, they disinfect and smell great!	&&&
This product seriously saves me time. With three little ones there is always a mess to clean up and the clorox wipes fix that problem in an snap.	&&&
Love using clorox wipes, its so easy just to use them at any time when clean up is needed. Will always use my clorox wipes for everything	&&&
I like the Clorox disinfecting wipes because it kills germs and it very easy to use. And I also use Clorox clean up for everything also tthey have great products.	&&&
"I know..it's a bit snooty to buy a wipe warmer but I did it so, my daughter doesn't kick me because of cold wipes..You would kick too if your TP was cold :)

It's not too expensive and works well..don't forget to wet the bottom pad or you will dry out the wipes

fyi .. This is a must have if you have a new born."	&&&
I have used Clorox wipes for a quick and easy cleanup. I love that it disinfects as well, which helps prevent the spreading of illness whenever someone is sick.	&&&
I love Huggies Wipes, they are so gentle on my babies sensitive skin. They are nice and thick and get the job done!	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are a fast an easy way to clean up and disinfect all around the house	&&&
We had a infestation of mice in our kitchen and baby nursery. I knew I could trust clorox wipes to not only clean but sanitize everything the little disease filled rodents touched.	&&&
These are smaller size and more like paper than the softer larger Purell wipes. You get what you pay for.	&&&
Very nice wipes. They're almost quilted and are very soft. I really like them especially since they are less expensive than the brand name wipes.	&&&
"These wipes are magical. Like most ""typical"" guys, I don't own much silverware. I have a few pieces of silverware I've received as gifts / heirlooms. One of the sets tarnishes so easily (I think due to its high silver content).

I tried to be cheap and do the aluminum foil + baking soda + salt + vinegar trick you find on the internet and youtube. Big mistake. Firstly it only got rid of maybe 1/3 of the tarnish. Secondly I ended up scratching my silverware on the aluminum foil. :(

In contrast, just a few light polishes with these wipes, and my silverware looked brand new. So easy, love it."	&&&
I love that they are big wipes, yet biodegradable. It' cleanses everything and you feel fresh.	&&&
I use clorox cleaning wipes everyday. I use them in my car, around my house, and at work. They are handy, disinfecting, and reliable to do the job at hand. Thank you!	&&&
These wipes are fantastic. They have no scent which I reaaly like. Best of all, they are always moist and allow you to use less to get the job done. These wipes are a great value.	&&&
With 2 little boys Clorox wipes are the best for cleaning up the bathroom in a hurry. I never put them away.	&&&
I absolutely love the wipes for cleaning my bathroom, especially around the toilet!	&&&
Love the wipes and the Lemon smell of the wipes!I love the Clorox on the go wipes too! These wipes are great in killing germs! I feel that my counters, toys, grocery cart handles are clean after use of this item! Love them!! Have them in my house, car, and at work!!	&&&
I've used many natural brands: Earth's best, Babyganics, etc. These are by far the worst. They are about half the size of other wipes - like little mini baby wipes - and they are quite dry. I have a hard time accomplishing any "cleaning" with these. I'm kicking myself for using subscribe and save - now I'm stuck with 5 more packs. Go with another brand!	&&&
"****Disclaimer**** I received this product for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.

I was thoroughly impressed with these thermalabs tanning towelettes. Before they came in the mail I thought they were going to be a towelette version of the stuff that comes in a bottle and expected it to be a skin tone color,but they look just like the towels you use to cleanse your skin and take off makeup with.These are super easy to use,there is this little perforation in the box,just punch that out and slip out a little packet,obviously open it and just run the towel all over areas you desire to be tan and your done.Now it does take some time for the color to show up,and start looking bronze.I could not believe how tan I looked even after just one application,and no streaking and no ugly orange color.I usually don’t tan because those cream and lotions are such a pain and not worth the results at all but,you honestly have none of that with these at all.Of course I have included below a few photos so you can see the before and after of the unedited results.The first Is just a shot of what the wipes look like and the packaging too,the next photo is my arm on the wrist area you can see how light my complexion was before and the darker parts are my arms which I applied only one wipe,amazing color pay off right?The last photo is of my face on the left is the before,you can see how light I was,and I am not wearing any makeup,on the right is the after results of my face after just two towelettes were applied.Lastly you can find these on amazon,right now they are offering there biggest package ever the super saver,which includes 20 towelettes for just $12.95,usually there is 10 per pack,cheaper than most brands for double the price and half or less of the amount of wipes.These wipes are small enough if you want to pack a few,keep them in your purse,pocket etc.No horrible smell either."	&&&
"I was in desperate search for an effective wash cloth when my old tiny awesome facial towel from Korea was out the door. I brought cleansing oil and small facial wash cloth that worked very well together from Korea, but it would be costly to fly back for my facials! Subsequently, I tried harsh facial wipes which dried my face effectively and mild facial cleansers which did not remove make-up effectively. I did some research and came across this product. I gave it a shot although the pictures and descriptions were quite confusing.

1. The cleansing wipes are very hard unless they touch water. Don't let it scare you. It is not meant for harsh exfoliation. It softens immediately.
2. The softened wipes feel like activity towels(?). I remember my sister used to use/love a funky Nike towel that dries your body and then itself for packing like no other. I cannot tell you if this wipe and the vaguely remembered towel are the same material, but I can tell you that this wipe can be used with soap and is not for drying.
3. I personally use it with my favorite mild facial cleanser (Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cleanser) that is not quite effective by itself. I see that this wipe takes off my eye makeup really well. I am so amazed with this thing, now I always wipe one side of my face, look at the mirror, and compare the other side to see how it works against facial cleanser alone.

It does a great job of removing any types of make up (daily light make up and heavy night-out make up). My face is still dry, but I do not think it is because of this wipe. My face is just dry no matter what I do. This wipe is a cleansing wipe, not a moisturizer, so I am pleased with what it does for cleansing."	&&&
"""As a teacher, having Lysol Disinfecting Wipes on hand is essential to each day since it is flu season. The wipes are very derable, while having enough of the solution on it to clean 7-9 desks with one wipe compared to off-brands in which I can only clean 3 or 4 desks. The lemon and lime blossom scent is not too overpowering, like other brands. Using these wipes makes me feel confadent with how clean my room is by knowing that the solution in the wipes kills 99.9% of harmful bacteria and flu viruses while making my desks smell clean.



I would highly recommend this product to other customers."""	&&&
I love using these wipes. They are so easy to use and make clean up for this mom a much less daunting task.	&&&
Loves these wipes	&&&
I use clorox wipes for everything around the house. I use them for the kitchen, bathroom, door knobs, etc... They are convenient and do a great job at disinfecting	&&&
Clorox wipes are trustworthy, dependable. They are the only wipes I use.	&&&
I have young children 3 and under. The disinfecting wipes are my favorite because i can use them on so much and they are so convenient. i used them on toys, furniture, counter tops, high chairs etc... im in love with these and go through them so fast	&&&
I couldn't clean anywhere without my wipes! always in hand and use them for everything!!!	&&&
"Using Thermalabs Self Tanning Towelettes is great alternative to exposing your skin to harmful tanning beds or the harmful rays of the sun. Honestly when I first saw this product I figured it wouldn't work. There's too many others that simply do not work or turn you orange. Well, this one does neither. This looks just like baby wipes and is packaged individually and honestly has little to no smell.I wiped down my legs, arms, face, etc. giving this a test run and hoping for the best. When applying it goes on clear, you can't tell where you wiped nor do you feel any pain or tingling. Much to my surprise a few hours later I noticed a difference. I wasn't dark nor was I orange. I just had a natural looking tan to my skin. The downside? Because you can't see where the wipe hit you can't know if you got full coverage. For example, I know I wiped every part, but the wipe does dry out as a baby wipe would so two wipes are actually more necessary. Being it was my first time using these I was careful with application and didn't want to over do it. So the next day I applied a second ""wipe down"" and I noticed I had one line of where I must have not gotten going down my arm and a few on my upper leg. While it doesn't leave streaks where you get, this looked a bit funny. Luckily it's been cold so long sleeves covered me up not to mention it looked natural like I had laid out on something to tan so it wasn't horrible; just noticeable. Of course I tried to wipe that are and fix it and shower to get it off - nothing worked. So this is a ""permanent"" type of tan. It does NOT just wash or wipe off. Once it's on it's on to stay until it fades out. I've worn mine for several days now and it's starting to fade. Once I get it completely faded I intend to have a ""re-do"". My face came out great though with a lovely look.

Overall this is a super awesome self tanning product that requires little work. It's easy to use and works great. I'd only change that you could temporarily see some color while applying to know which areas you hit to avoid missing spots on your body. It takes a few hours before the tan shows up, but it comes on naturally and looks natural. I love it; especially being one who typically burns rather than tans!

P.S. - the only reason I didn't take ""Before and After"" Photos is because I honestly didn't expect this to work!"	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I take them to church camp every year and wipe EVERYTHING down in my cabin, Use throughout the year at my house.	&&&
My daughter suffered from numerous UTI's before we tried these wipes. We finally figured out the problem lied in the wipes. Water wipes are the only wipes we can use and will use. She hasn't had a UTI in months since switching and she doesn't cringe when we wipe her bottom any more. I highly recommend these.	&&&
Great wipes, don't have any strong alcoholic smell like some other sanitizing wipes. Huge container and wipes are very good size, very strechy and sturdy. Love to use this to wipe hands and all kind of surfaces! Great value.	&&&
very convenient, smell is not as strong as other wipes. easily disposable without wasting paper towels to get the job done.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great. They are wonderful for everyday messes and hard to clean situations.	&&&
HUGGIES Natural Care Wipes are the only wipes that I buy for my 4 month old. We found out early on, that he has quite a few allergies and from that moment on, I decided to be most careful when choosing his baby products. I buy three or four cases of these wipes at a time. They are thick and gentle, and they get even the messiest diaper changes done with just one or two wipes. I actually still have a ton of other brand wipes left over from my shower. I have used a couple, but always seem to go b ack to HUGGIES Natural Care because we love them so much. I would definitely recommend these wipes for newborns, babies with sensitive skin or rashes, or any other baby out there. Hope this helps!! 	&&&
It is a great product and I love the smell of the cleaning wipes. I always purchase Clorox wipe and not the off brand	&&&
Love Clorox wipes-work great and convenient when on the go!	&&&

Love the whole line of wipes! Convenient and easy to use!	&&&
Clorox wipes are perfect for my small kids to use to clean their messes.	&&&
I use almost every Clorox product available. My favorite is Clorox wipes, I use them in every room of my house. I love that I no longer have to reuse rags to clean the bathroom. Thanks Clorox for awesome products that keep my house looking, and smelling clean.	&&&
I really enjoy the Clorox disinfecting wipes. The thing I like the most of this product is the convenience and ease of use. Even the kids can help me clean now. Another nice part is the fresh and gentle scent.	&&&
I really love to use the clorox wipes in my bathroom. It allows my kids to help clean too. Great product.	&&&
I love how clean these wipes get my whole house! And so easy my kids can use them too!	&&&
Clorox wipes are easy to use and convenient to keep in each bathroom.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I've buying them for years and my kid's teachers love to get them through the year. Excellent product.	&&&
I love that I can carry with and use instantly Clorox wipes to help my family stay healthier!	&&&
These wipes are convenient, effective cleaning tools! Great for cleaning bathroom or kitchen counters. Spill some egg or meat drippings? No problem! These clean and disinfect at once. Good quality, great convenience! I will buy these for years to come.	&&&
ITS AMAZING IT CLEANS EVERYTHING NEATLY SUCH AN EASY WAY TO USE IT LOVE THE WIPES WHAT WOULD THE WORLD BE WITHOUT CLOROX	&&&
I use the wipes everywhere in the house. i like how easy they are to use.	&&&
I love the wipes! Great for quick cleanups and disinfecting!	&&&

I love the scent of the Clorox lemon disinfecting wipes because they leave my kitchen smelling so lemony clean!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They are convenient and clean the heck out of anything!	&&&
Love these wipes and the smell. Anything lemon reminds me of my mom cleaning on Sundays when I was a child. Smells refreshing and smells like everything is clean and germ free.	&&&
Clorox wipes has helped me keep up with three boys, they are easy to open wipe and throw away! PLUS I feel like I'm protecting my family from germs at the same time. I love the product!	&&&
They work just as well as the name brand!	&&&
Was cheap and very affordable and good for my son	&&&
I tried Boogie wipes a few years ago and now will not be without them! They save my house of little noses from being red and raw from plain old tissues. They also help their colds clear up much faster. Love them!	&&&
I like these wipes a lot. I only wish that the wipes were biodegradable and they could be refillable to reduce the amount of plastic.	&&&
Tried them the last time my son had a cold. They really do break the boogies down better than regular wipes. I now stock up during cold season with Boogie Wipes! :)	&&&
My son had a chronically runny nose as a toddler, and Boogie Wipes was sensitive enough for regular use, and did a good job of adhering to, well, mucus, snot and boogers. This product is aptly named!	&&&
Target's brand "face and hand wipes" ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THESE!!! The Johnson and Johnson brand wipes have an incredibly strong perfume-y scent, not good for newborn baby's sensitive skin. They made my daughter breakout in a pimplely rash all over her face, and I didn't trust using them on her hands because of the strong smell- didn't want her putting that in her mouth. I threw them away after using one! Target "Up and Up" wipes are cheaper, have NO strong scent, and didn't cause any rashes. Try these instead, trust me!	&&&
I have 3 grandchildren all under the age of 2. I use Boogie Wipes ALL the time! Little ones never seem to enjoy having their faces and noses swiped but Boogie Wipes make a TREMENDOUS difference! They don't protest at all when I wipe their faces!! It's a great product! I love it and so do they!!!	&&&
Prefer Huggies, but these are second best. I have used pampers in the past, but nothing like Huggies and boogie wipes.	&&&
This product is wonderful! It is so easy to throw these in our bag when we go to the park or to an event and have them on hand in case runny noses start!If your child doesn't enjoy heavily scented products, it may be better to choose the unscented version as these grape wipes are VERY grape-y!	&&&
They're diapers. The kid doesn't get a rash and unless Junior is especially enthusiastic the blowouts are rare.	&&&
This is such a great product! Not only is it soft, but oh so durable and can handle the messiest of messes. It is so gentle on my baby's skin and I'm sure he can thank these wipes for that. I am really impressed with this product and I wont buy anything else!	&&&
I received a small pack from a friend after i had a my 1st child. I did not use until after i had incidents with tissues making my daughters skin dry and ultimately bleeding. Once i tried boogie wipes i have never turned back. They are a must have for any parent with small children.	&&&
I love using boogie wipes for my son! Its so convienent having saline wipes when thats what I prefer using for a stuff nose too!	&&&
I am an in home day care provider with 7 currently in diapers. I am working on potty training 3 of them right now and the Boogie wipes are the best thing I have used!	&&&
The unscented wipes are truly amazing for great durability, for any tough mess.	&&&
I love huggies wipes.	&&&
I was amazed at just how well these wipes work, even on old , seriously tarnished silver pieces. I'll buy more, and would definitely recommend them.	&&&
I'm so glad I bought these when they were on sale. My son got sick and had plenty of boogies. These moist wipes are perfect for him	&&&
The wipes warmer is necessary in my baby's diaper change. I used it every day in home or travel.	&&&
Earths best wipes have always been great. This was not the Orange box like pictured- rather the brown and green so I was worried at first. The wipes seem to be similar if not the same to the ones I've previously been purchasing that are in the yellow box.	&&&
They are almost perfect. My son potty trained early so wiping has really been the only chalenge. He just can'take reach! These wipes feel good against the skin and don'the leave a soapy residue. The only problem a that you have to fold it in half first or it will tear which means you have to use more wipes in one sitting. Otherwise, fantastic.	&&&
I normally use pampers sensitive wipes, and have for both of my children, but these wipes are great also! I use wipes for everything, not just diaper changes, and these stood up to the test of messy hands, faces, sticky messes, etc. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
Love our huggies wipes! We use them daily for quite a lot of things, not just for diapering. We keep a tub in the kitchen and wipe the kids down after meals as well as their booster seats/kitchen chairs. I often wonder if we will still buy Huggies wipes even when our children are out of diapers lol.	&&&
I used to rely on these wipes and swore by them. Now the new formulation is terrible! What I loved about them is how wet and sudsy they were; now they are dry and rough. Please go back to the old formulation!	&&&
My children love these wipes. Whenever they sneeze they automatically ask for the booby wipes. Once in a while I run out and they can tell the difference from the baby wipes.	&&&
I have been buying boogie wipes for the last four years and I use them for cleaning kids, cleaning dirty hands during fishing/camping trips and much more! These wipes are just the right thickness to not rip during use either. I have boogie wipes stored in my house, car, and purse for easy access everyday.	&&&
I am 64 and my daughter introduced Boogie Wipes to me about 4 years ago. My grandson was having a terrible time with a cold and Boogie Wipes were the best. I have used them for my own "sniffles" ever since. I have bought these for my friends and they are very thankful. Thanks Boogie Wipes.	&&&
I have been ordering these wipes by the case for 2 years. Immediately, I noticed that the packaging had changed and the thickness of the package had decreased. Upon opening, I thought they seemed very dry. As I used them, I realized that they changed the wipes completely. They are smaller, less moist, and most disappointingly are made of a thinner and rougher nonwoven. I loved these wipes because of their greater surface area and substantial solution and thickness. Now they feel like all of the other ones out there. This will be my last order.	&&&
The Charmin wipes have a substantial feel yet are soft. They easily flush down the toilet. We will order these again	&&&
I love how wet these wipes are compared to others. Most wipes dry before you get them out if the box good much less actually make it to baby's bum nice & damp.	&&&
Nice fit, easy to use, and much more absorbent that the thinner belly bands I've used in the past for my pup. I generally only use them to avoid inside accidents when it's rainy and my dog doesn't want to go outside. They work much better than the bellow bands I used to use as they seem to somehow remind him not to potty inside, even with the protection of the wrap. When he does urinate while weating a wrap ., it is much more absorbent than the belly bands even with a small pad tucked inside.. I take it off quickly when he goes outside, it's usually dry (clean and unused) so I can reuse it.	&&&
Boogie Wipes are a necessity for constant runny noses. They keep the nose from getting dry and red, causing further irritation to an already annoying cold.	&&&
I buy these for my two kids who are constantly blowing their noses because of allergies or colds!!!! They LOVE the grape smell. Says it stays with them ALL day. Boogie Wipes are an awesome product and recommend them to anyone with raw noses!!!!!! Easy to carry, transport or just throw in the car on the go!!!! We LOVE them.	&&&
We got a sample pack of boogie wipes in the mail. those wipes are great Usually when you get those they are all dried up but these were well hydrated and the scent is quit pleasant.i would recommend these to people with or without kids.	&&&
4 kids and there is always a runny nose here. My husband couldn't understand what is so great about Boogie Wipes. Just use Kleenex he said. Yea, try wiping the runny nose of an unhappy 2 year old with Kleenex. Grape Boogie Wipes to the rescue. Easy on sore noses and the smell is a good distraction. We just ordered for this winter, triple what we bought last year because we ran out and that wasn't good.	&&&
I love huggies wipes and these are my favorite. They're thick so you don't have to use as many. My son isn't allergic to scented wipes, however I can't stand the smell of wipes so i like that they offer wipes without scents.	&&&
I was expecting more with the glowing reviews, but I guess I was hoping for too much. The wipes themselves work okay, but you certainly need to "loosen" the dirt/grime in your bathroom by wetting it before you use the wipes. Otherwise, it's pretty much a lysol wipe. Works just fine otherwise , and I don't like the adverse health affects of aersol, so I suppose it's worth sucking it up and pre-wetting the cleaning area before use.	&&&
THe only wipes I've found that don't dry out in the package.	&&&
I bought this last week. It says it is unscented but the smell is very strong. The price is too high for the amount of wipes included. I tried to wipe some dried baby food off the table but it did not do anything.	&&&
This worked great last winter...living in New England, where it is cold & getting colds are very common! We always have a package of boogie wipes in our diaper bag. They work great & so gentle on our little ones nose.	&&&
"My daughter loves boogie wipes. The saline makes them softer on little noses!"	&&&
I used these wipes when i potty trained my daughters. The wipes were softer and moister than regular toilet paper and really cleaned their bottoms well.	&&&
Boogie wipes are perfect!! I always have plenty on hand for cold and allergy season...we love them!!	&&&
Product was all dried out, usless.	&&&
I thought at first that it would be silly to buy wipes just for runny noses but I'm really glad I tried Boogie Wipes out. Although I usually rip the tissue in half so I can stretch them (my 2 year old's nose isn't so big he needs the whole thing for one use!) The saline helps break up and wipe away and dried boogies, which is great so you don't have to scrub.	&&&
Now I can quickly get cleaned up and turn the red light back on.	&&&
I love using boogie wipes on my toddler! Unlike tissues, the moisture from boogie wipes keeps constantly runny noses from getting irritated and red. I now include a pack with every baby gift I give. And I find the grape scent oddly refreshing while constantly wiping a snotty nose!	&&&
I've been buying these grape scented boogie wipes since my son was a baby. (He's 4 now). My son loves them! He will only let me blow his now with these boogie wipes because they smell like candy. They are gentle on his nose and they don't leave his nose red/ dry like normal Kleenex does. We are avid buyers of this product. Love them!	&&&
My kids hate having their faces wiped with normal wet wipes and they put up a fight usually but they love boogie wipes for whatever reason they don't mind letting me wipe those sticky gross boogers off with these. I buy them every time they have a cold!	&&&
I love the boogie wipes. Great for kids of all ages!	&&&
The old version in the yellow packaging were awesome 5 star (I even kept having them sent to me overseas when I moved), but the new version in the wood grain packaging are useless. I can't believe I have to decide whether to use 800 of these worthless, dry wipes that go right over the stuff they're supposed to remove or simply throw them out.	&&&
"How 2 simple words can make a HUUUUGE difference! ""Boogie wipes"" my grandson is an avid nose picker..where do they end up? Let's just say he apparently acquired a taste for the nasty things. Ugh. After the good ol' don't eat your booger talk, it went in one ear and out the other.
I picked up these boogie wipes and my grandson was so thrilled with the product's name/packaging, he now gets rewarded for using the ""magic wipes"" ...the boogers go to a ""magical"" place in outer space after they're placed on the wipe, folded (closing the doors) recite the countdown and dropped in a spaceship made from an unused tissue box. PERFECTO!!"	&&&
Contained too much moisture .. at the bottom of the container there is standing liquid. Surprisingly , we prefer the wal-mart brand of baby wipes. Won't buy these again.	&&&
I love wipes especially when I need to clean in a hurry!	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are perfect to have on hand for my 3 messy boys! From juice spills to dirty door handles, we carry them everywhere we go!!!	&&&
I love Clorox disinfecting spray and the Clorox wipes....they help me to keep my house clean and sanitized!!!	&&&
We tried these out after using Pampers sensitive wipes for a long time. We won't be using them again. The wipe itself is fine. A little on the dry side, but quite soft. The problem is that the wipes stick together more than other brands once you get half way through the package. This gives you three options while changing your baby: 1. Take your other hand off the baby (with predictably messy results!) to separate the wipes; 2. Do the crazy one-handed shake to try to get just one wipe; or 3. Resign yourself to using way more wipes than you need to by pulling two or three out at one time. Obviously option 3 is the default, which defeats the purpose of paying slightly less money for good wipes.	&&&
love the disinfecting wipes.easy to use they pick up evrything	&&&
I really like and the powerful cleaning of these wipes!	&&&
I really like the wipes because I can use just the right amount and not have such a strong bleach smell throughout my house and my oldest can use them and I don't have to worry about her ruining something by spilling the bleach everywhere.	&&&
I LOVE the Clorox cleanup wipes such a convience and I love the smell and ie never cared for rages or sponges, germ holders!	&&&
I like these wipes, but it is too easy to waste them.	&&&
I love the quality as well as the cleaning abilities of Clorox wipes. Not a day goes by that I don't wipe something down with one.	&&&
Wipes are moist and warm. My baby doesn't flinch from cold wipes anymore, but warm still makes him pee when I use them. I only gave 4 stars because the lid is difficult to open.	&&&
I use the Clorox disinfectant wipes on every surface in my house! I have an infant, so everything is going in to her mouth these days. It's quick and easy to keep everything sanitary with just a few wipes!	&&&
love your wipes. I use them all the time for cleaning around the house	&&&
"Let me just say I am p-a-l-e pale pale PALE. So I am always pretty nervous trying tanning lotions. I love having a hit of color and really feel better with a little glow.
When I got this box I read the instructions so I didn't mess any thing up. I ripped the tab off the box and got out one package. I couldn't wait to use it. I took a shower and used an exfoliating body scrub and also shaved my legs. After showing I used an all over body lotion. I believe that prepping your skin is very important for good steak free results.
The next day I applied a small amount of lotion to my feet and knees. I decided to just tan just my legs to test out the wipes. I opened the pack and carefully unfold it. You could see that the wipe was wet but not dripping. The tanning wipes didn't have any smell. I simply used the tanning towel like a baby wipe. I started just below my knee and went up and down around my whole bottom leg. I did a very quick sweep over my knee and then finished my top leg just like I did the bottom. You can then look at the towel and see that the spot you just used is dry so you want to make sure and move your hand so you are using a the wet side. I did my other leg just like the first. My legs had a slight tingle feel as I used the wipe but it only lasted about 5 seconds. When I was done I threw the towel away and washed my hands. I waited 10 minutes to get dressed even though I didn't feel it was necessary since my legs were dry almost instantly.
I didn't have any quick results and the wait was very hard. I was nervous that I would be orange or splotchy. About 5 hours later I could tell a slight difference. By the end of the day I had developed a nice hint of color. BUT I wanted to push my luck even farther and decided to do another coat! I did the second application just like the first and then went to bed.
The next morning when I work up I was pretty nervous to look at my legs since I had done a double dose. To my surprise I had actually gotten a very nice looking tan color over night. I am very very pleased with the results. I have a nice even color and my knees and ankles weren't the slightest bit of orange.
Over all I think these are great tanning wipes. I am going to tan the rest of my body and face today!"	&&&
The wipes are very strong and can remove stains very quickly!	&&&
We use these wipes in our cleaning business. Leaves the surfaces clean, disinfected, and smelling fabulous!!	&&&
As a mom of 3 Clorox Wipes are a household staple (actually i keep some in my car too) I love that that removes stains and disinfect- Keeping my house clean and my little ones safe!	&&&
I can't run my household without Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. Where other people clean up after their children, I'm constantly following behind my four-legged children (cats# who dine on our bathroom counters, away from our other four-legged child #dog), who would otherwise eat their food. I have Clorox Wipes in almost every room in the house. Thank you, Clorox!! I love the scrubbing side, especially!!	&&&
These wipes are really handy to use around the house to quickly disinfect	&&&
Clorox does a great job again. These wipes are fantastic!	&&&
Huggies Soft Skin are the ONLY wipes we use. We have sensitive skin in our family and tend to get breakouts or rashes easily - these are the only wipes that do not aggregate our skin. They smell amazing too - sweet with a hint of chocolate. The huge refill packs are super convenient. They store well in our food storage as well.	&&&
The Clorox wipes are easy to use. Great for bathrooms and kitchens. Wipe up messes then throw the wipe away	&&&
I love these wipes, they are all I buy. Easy to use at home or travel. A must in my book.	&&&
I like to switch back and forth between these wipes and the sensitive pampers wipes. I have been impressed with them. I like to use the sensitive wipes more but since these ones are a little cheaper than those I switch back and forth to save a little money. Either or both products are good! I will continue to use both! my husband is also very happy and impressed that we havent had any rash or irritation from using pampers products!	&&&
the wipes are so convenient and they really disinfect.	&&&
As a mom of three, I don't want to slow down to clean and disinfect and clorox wipes are an easy, fast way to wipe up spills and sanitize without sprays.	&&&
As with all pampers products these wipes are superior to other brands! We love the smell of them and they do a great job	&&&
I love how convenient Clorox wipes are! I can just grab a tub and disinfect quickly!	&&&
I hate these wipes. They are very thin you can't even pull them out without one of them tearing in half. I also feel like their texture is terrible, it doesn't glide smoothly, it gets stuck on the skin and you have to wipe forcefully to clean the baby. Pampers sensitive is the best!	&&&
Clorox wipes are so convenient to use. You can take them anywhere. Great disinfectant	&&&
LOVE these wipes! Easy and convenient. Easy enough for my 11 year old to use when doing his chores.	&&&
Clorox Wipes offer a quick, convenient way to get rid of germs. Even me kids can get in on the cleaning!	&&&
Awesome! My house has never been cleaner. I love Clorox wipes. Perfect for the flu season!!	&&&
I have a 2 year old petri dish at home. So with him being sick and getting the whole family sick all the time we went through a lot of tissue. After using tissues my kids noses get all raw and red. With Boogie wipes this doesn't happen! This cuts down on the chasing of my toddler to wipe his nose. Happy kids, happy mom!	&&&
the best wipes for kids. Our baby does not have a rashes that other wipes leaves in her skin. The only observation. Do Not Use this wipes on thermal warmer wipes cabinet they will dry.	&&&
The baby fresh is the only wipe on the market with that baby scent everyone is looking for :-) The moist durable wipes clean away big messes easily.	&&&
"I first purchased the water wipes when we decided to go more natural for our boys. Those actually gave my 2 yr old and 11 month old a bad rash. So we switched to these and I absolutely love them!! The only thing that is a pain is the packaging. Sometimes two wipes come out at once. But its not that big of an issue for me. I will continue to use these."	&&&
Compared to the hospital grade version. This by far more superior in quality. It holds up nicely when wet. Ultra soft, not to heavy and not too thin. We are re-ordering our next batch!	&&&
I have a gold watch passed down to me thru many years......these clothes really brighten it up! Definitely worth buying IMHO!	&&&
They do their job and hold in the poop while hardly leeking. I'm a happy uncle anytime I have to babysit when these are wrapped around his ass.	&&&
these are too delicate to clean with"}},	&&&
Everyone loves the convenience of wipes for cleaning, they are super quick and convenient so what isn't to love? I had stopped buying the Clorox and Lysol ones because I was concerned about the safety, both for the environment and my family, of their ingredients. And I was really missing the fact that even my husband would grab a wipe from time to time and wipe down the bathroom counters or around the kitchen sink. So I was THRILLED when I discovered these Seventh Generation wipes. They clean as well as any conventional wipes that I have used but inctead of harsh chemicals they use thymol, which is derived from thyme. Now if my daughter accidentally touches a surface that I have just wiped with these I am not as concerned, although I will still rinse her hand. I don't mind the smell of these at all. Unlike conventional disinfecting wipes they don't have a harsh chemical, or overly cloying artificial scent. It is a fresh slightly "herbal" scent that doesn't hang around long after the surface dries.	&&&
I carry these in my pocketbook everywhere. Especially now that it is flu season after we go to malls, supermarkets or anyplace we are worried about catching germs we use these.	&&&
I bought these to supplement my supply of cloth wipes which I'd bought of Etsy. They're fine, I mean, they do what they're supposed to do (wipe a kid's butt) however the stiching on both packs (I bought two) has already some undone after one wash! By contrast the Etsy wipes I bought have lasted for about a hundred washes with not a single loose thread. If you need wipes super fast (as I did) I guess you could buy these with Prime, but if you have some time to wait get them from an Etsy seller and support a small business while getting a superior product!	&&&
I am a Registered Medicolegal Death Investigator, I use this product daily, as a Medical Examiner Investigator handling dead bodies.	&&&
The Lysol 4 in 1 Disinfecting Spring Waterfall Scented Wipes are packaged in a nifty canister, giving me peace of mind that the 35 thick, pre-moistened wipes will not dry out with its sealed lid feature. Each wipe kills 99.9% of bacteria and viruses such as cold and flu's, making the task of disinfecting my home easy during flu season. The Lysol wipes were ideal for me with cleaning, disinfecting and deodorizing the entire household. Area’s such as the kitchen with my kitchen appliances and counters tops, stove, the cabinets, spills made on the floor and even my garbage can as the Lysol wipes cleaned the dust gathering on the lid and disinfected any bacteria lingering around the lid as well as removing those awful smells of cat food and waste. The Lysol wipes feature a lovely scent, refreshing my house with that Spring Waterfall fragrance as well as clearing the area of all germs. If you want to benefit your family by providing them with a germ free home, then purchase the Lysol wipes and see for yourself the difference it makes.	&&&
I absolutely love Huggies So Soft! The wipes leave my babies bottoms soft and clean but also smelling great. I have 5 children and have used Huggies brand diapers and wipes for all of them!	&&&
I love these Clorox disinfectant wipes - expecially the lemon ones! So convenient and practical. Can't live without them!	&&&
i love clorox disinfecting wipes. as a mother of a very active 16 month old boy, clorox disinfecting wipes is a reliable clean up buddy. it definitely helps protect my family from germs and keeps clean up a breeze.	&&&
I buy and use almost every clorox product on the market ranging from toilet cleaners, kitchen cleaners, wipes, laundry, sprays. Gives a confident clean and cleanses and removes stains and odors! I definitely recommend clorox products!	&&&
Love the Clorox Wipes! They not only disinfect but also leave my house smelling clean! Thanks!	&&&
Great wipes. I didn't realize it came with the plastic container. Was trying to avoid that. May be my error in not reading the description.	&&&
"These are probably the best wipes that we have used for any of our kids. They're strong, hold up well, and the package is convenient for travelling while creating very little waste (unlike the hard plastic tubs that we used to have). They're good for cleaning up children from infants to high school age. Why not a five star review? Quite simply, the name. ""Huggies One and Done"", let's examine that. Huggies - no issue there, it's the brand name. It makes sense for this to be on the wipes. One - a word used to identify a single unit, this package contains 448 of them. Done - Nothing wrong with that either, I like being done. It's when the remaining word is added - One 'and' Done - that I have an issue. This statement, however well meaning by the Huggies marketing department, is a lie. Not only a lie, but quite possibly the biggest lie in the history of marketing departments. No mess ever created by any of my three children that required cleanup with a wet wipe has ever been completed with a single one. Ever. Cleaning kid's hands after eating Doritos in the car - no less than two wipes each. Full diaper - at least seven wipes and possibly more. Lunch at the BBQ restaurant - easily past a dozen wipes. There is no possible scenario in my kid's lives in which I can say the job was done with only a single wipe.
Unless the statement is meant to imply ""one pack of wipes and done"" in which case it could be quite accurate.

In short, the wipes are good and the marketing slogan is a complete and utter falsehood."	&&&
Good stuff, these Clorox wipes. Too bad they are so pricey.	&&&
I love these wipes. My kids use them everyday at home and also at their schools. They are so convenient for small wipeups.	&&&
These wipes are convenient and a great disinfectant!!	&&&
I love using Clorox Wipes. They are easy and convenient. I use them in every single room of our house. I've tried using other brands, even generic brands, and they are just not the same. They smelled too strong and were too thin. I love the textured surface of these wipes. It makes cleaning even the most difficult areas a breeze! Highly recommend!	&&&
Great product! I love using Clorox wipes. So easy!	&&&
There is no other product like Clorox. You can use it in so many ways. My favorite product is the Clorox wipes. They are so convenient!	&&&
The wipes come in handy with two little ones running around. I can clean any place faster than they can get back to it!	&&&
i use Clorox wipes ,bleach, sprays, and cleaners,i use them in the house,on the go, at work	&&&
Love clorox. We use a lot of clorox products but the wipes are by far the favorite in our household.	&&&
Using Clorox wipes is the easiest way to keep my home clean and sanitized. I have a five year old and I like to keep the house as germ free as possible. I have even taught him to use them to clean up after himself.	&&&
As the first time parent of a newborn, I am constantly worried about germs or anything that might cause her to get sick. I use the Clorox wipes daily because the smell is not too strong for her to be near and when I am finished, I know that anything she touches is super clean and germ free. I use these daily with confidence.	&&&
My family and I use the disinfect wipes religiously in our home to clean.	&&&
Love that this container holds all wipes well in place . I believe this tub is more Sanatary to use as you don't have to have to dig with your fingers through the Huggies refillable box .. The weight on this product that holds the wipes down has a nice large opening and no longer have to dig for wipes .	&&&
I just love how clorox keeps my house virus free everytime my son gets sick i desinffect everything with clorox either spray bleack and wipes and for some reason a day after he gets better its like magic.. Thank you soo much for making such a great product dont know what i'll do with out clorox.	&&&
There are two products that we always have on hand at our house. 1st is Clorox disinfecting wipes 2nd is baby wipes. Nothing works as fast and effortless than Clorox wipes.	&&&
i really like Clorox wipes for disinfecting during flu season!	&&&
I love to use Clorox wipes on everything to help clean and kill germs.	&&&
I highly recommend these wipes! They're quick and easy to use. Whether it's cleaning up a random spill or wiping down the counters after a meal, their uses are endless & always get the job done!	&&&
Clorox wipes are the easiest way to disinfect around the house. and are affordable to send to my children's school	&&&
I carry the wipes in my car and use them when I go into a store to wipe grocery buggy handles, etc.	&&&
Love the convenient of the wipes. Used them to clean the surrounding toilet areas.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes to clean my bathrooms. I hate sponge cleaning so with the wipes, I just wipe things down and throw the wipe away.	&&&
Clorox wipes are convenient and great for all types of surfaces. I use them all the time!	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are a quick and simple way to clean. I use them in my kitchen, mostly. These wipes are easy-to-use, quick, and there's no mess to go along with a simple cleanup. I love how they disinfect without having to get out rags, paper towels, and other cleaners. Also, you can use them on doorknobs, computer keyboards, well, anywhere really for a quick disinfect. They are great!	&&&
Clorox wipes are very easy for my children to use. I love that!	&&&
I like Clorox wipes because they make clean up faster. Don't have to spray anything to disinfect. Just grab a wipe and clean	&&&
Terry wipes were great, they met all my expectations. I've been looking all over for terry cloths to fit my dust mop. The quality and size were perfect.	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes they are ready to use and easy to clean with. Clean and toss	&&&
I love these wipes. They are really thick and work great. They were the first wipes I bought for my baby and I loved them. I would buy them all the time but sometimes I do change up the wipes based on whichever wipes are on sale or have the best deal which a lot of times isn't this one unfortunately because I always find Huggies wipes cheaper then this but I must say these are probably my favorite wipes out of all the ones I have tried so far for my baby.	&&&
Clorox wipes are convenient and easy to use. I use them to wipe up light messes in the kitchen and bathroom.	&&&
"These wipes were interesing to me since they came from Amazon. My husband and I have an Amazon addiction so we had to try them out. We have two kids in diapers - a toddler and a baby. We used to exclusively use Pamper's Sensitive and then Huggies One and Done. I wasn't a fan of the Huggies - they were too dry and I felt like I needed to use multiple wipes for ... messy diapers. Anyway...we went back to Pamper's but decided to give these a shot.

When I pulled them out of the box, the bottom of the packs felt cold to the touch - like all of the liquid sank to the bottom. This worried me but the wipes didn't seem dried out. They were drier than Pampers but I'm still able to tackle a big job with just one or two. They hold up pretty well. I haven't gotten to the bottom of the pack to see if the bottom of the pack is soggy - I'll update once I get there.

This may just have been me...but the pack was super hard to get open. Not intuitive at all. Same for putting the pack in the dispenser. The dispenser has weird holes to funnel the wipes through. Took me a while to get the hang of it - not something I would want to have to replicate in the middle of the night, for sure. Don't know why Amazon felt the need to reinvent the wheel here.

I'm not sure if we will buy again as these wipes aren't any cheaper or better than Pamper's but they are good wipes and they get the job done.

**EDITED 1/12/15**
I have gotten to the bottom of the pack and the wipes at the bottom are not any wetter than the other wipes - so that was good news. As well, I have trouble with the dispenser so I have replaced it with one of my Pampers dispensers. If the wipes don't thread through, it is very difficult to maneuver the wipe back through the hole - especially when you are trying to wrangle and squirmy baby on a changing pad. Also, I like that the Pampers Subscribe and Save that we used to get came with two travel packs- plus it was less expensive. Not sure we will buy again - may go back to Pampers."	&&&
I really am glad I have these wipes. They make it so easy for a quick, bathroom clean up. Just wipe up the sink and toilet and it is done. I have even used the wipes to clean the bathroom floor!	&&&
I like knowing my house is clean and germ free with Clorox wipes	&&&
I love these wipes. They get the job DONE! I disinfect everything with these!!!	&&&
This is a wonderful product. The convenience of pop up wipes is a added bonus.	&&&
With 6 people and 2 dogs in the house, love the convenience, the price and the cleaning power of clorox wipes	&&&
We love the product due to the disinfecting ability of the wipes. We use them all over the house and it keeps the house smelling great, too.	&&&
Our go-to wipes!	&&&
I clean everything with my clorox wipes i absolutely love them... They are a great value, and very convientent to use. I would be lost without my clorox wipes	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes! We keep them in the kitchen and bathrooms and use them all the time for quick effective cleanups!	&&&
Clorox wipes are the BEST! We use them everywhere, the bathroom, the kitchen, and the door knobs!	&&&
"These wipes as very small and thin; consequently, I had to use six individual pieces just to wipe off the white board once. You can imagine how many I had to use during my 1 1/2 hour class! At this rate, the bottle will be empty by the end of the week!

Further, the ""pop"" function does not work properly. The only way I can get the wipes off the role is to uncap the bottle, take out the role, and pull the wipes off one at a time like a role of paper towels.

This product has potential, but I think it currently needs to be sent back to the invention room.""}},"	&&&
"I was so excited when I found these. I had basically been refilling my own disposable plastic wipes packages and boy was that a pain!

Pros:
- easy to refill
- flexible case doesn't take up much room in your travel diaper-changing solution

Cons:
- wipes don't separate easily (both the ones that come with the pouch and when I refill it with other brands)
- rigid plastic opening on the case is not secure and easily peels off with use, drying out the wipes and making the case useless

I have a major issue with the durability of these cases, but I like the usefulness of the design so much that I have actually gone through about 4 of them in the last 6 months. But still, for something that should be reusable, that's really too much. Please fix the problem of the rigid flap peeling off the case and I will gladly keep purchasing them."	&&&
I use this product at home and at work. I love the convenience of using the wipes to wipe down keyboards and phones at work to disinfect community used products.	&&&
I prefer the Costco brand Kirkland's sensitive wipes.	&&&
I love how its unscented for my babies sensative skin and it wipes up everything (boogies/snot/etc) clean!	&&&
We use this product all the time! I love the scent and the durability of the wipes. Boogie Wipes are very handy to keep around--you never know what my 2 yr old son will get in to!	&&&
I first bought this specific wipes for my kids when they first learnt how to potty trained. Ever since then ,it has became a must have hygienic item in our house. I even sent it with my kids to school. The wipes which is made from high quality and safe materials gives cleaning an easy breezy job.	&&&
In the past, we tried several different types of flushable wipes. Now we only buy one: Kandoo. The wipes don't get dried up in the pack, even when they're accidentally left open. And they get the job done with fewer wipes used. Kandoo wipes are definitely the best!	&&&
My 14 month old has always produced a lot of boogers so I love to keep a pack of these handy in the diaper bag! One swipe and done for us vs baby wipes with all those chemicals I don't want near my little one's mouth... These also help her breathe better when she's sick. We'll be trying more products, but I think the unscented will always be a favorite with us.	&&&
These wipes are a little on the thin side, but get the job done. I still prefer pampers, though.	&&&
As a mother of a toddler and a 19 month old i always want the best solution and safe product for my children when they get sick or need a little saline solution to get the boogies out my children love these I have used boogie wipes for both of my kids they love to use these themselves we have been using boogie wipes for the last 3 years and me me husband and my kids love these so easy to use with no trouble or mess.	&&&
I started using these with my son when he was in Kindergarten and suffered from terrible allergies. They were easy to pop in his bag for whenever he needs them. Well, he's in middle school now and I still get them. I've used them with my second child since she was an infant. They're more gentle than regular baby wipes and my son wasn't embarrassed carrying these around versus a pack of baby wipes. Win, win! Love them and have recommended to friends!	&&&
When the weather cools down and we begin using the furnace, my little boy gets occasional nosebleeds. Boogie Wipes are the perfect solution to clean dried-on blood from his sensitive little nose. Thanks, Boogie Wipes!	&&&
Boogie Wipes are soft on the nose and smell great!	&&&
Very nice and helpful to use!	&&&
I used these on my newborn. They cleaned well. When she was just weeks old, she had little sores on her behind from all her newborn pooping :) That along with her sensitive skinskin, these helped ! Not harsh like regular wipes , moist as they should be. This box was great with the extras! It came with smaller packs for the diaper bag and car, plenty for the home. It also came with the container! You can't go wrong here!	&&&
I bought these wipes because I can be lazy when it comes to taking off my make up at the end of the day. I wear a moderate amount of makeup. I found these worked ok. I have to use about four wipes to get all of my makeup off.. and then something else for my eyes, as my eye make up wouldn't budge for these. They are a little drier than I hoped they would be. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.	&&&
Great wipes. Removes drippy nose residue and dried yucky nose gunk better than anything I've ever tried or thought to try!! We love the grape scent or the unscented. Never tried fresh scent.	&&&
Boogie Wipes are our favorite product by far! If you've got a runny nose, these are a nose saver! Forget about raw noses or faces - Boogie Wipes get the sticky snotty messes & keep your nose happy. Plus, they smell great! I can't recommend these enough - they are wonderful!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes in the bathroom daily. With 15 grandchildren and 5 pets they are a life saver!	&&&
"Softy Sanitizing Wipes for Hands and Surfaces is the best I have used so far! I use Lysol or off brands Lysol wipes and they dry out my hands so bad. It has come to the point that the last time we went out shopping I bought latex gloves, so that it would protect my hands from the harsh sanitizing wipes. I was nervous to try that Softy Sanitizing Wipes for Hands and Surfaces without the gloves, but I did and my hands did not dry out or get damaged since there are not any harsh chemicals. Another added plus is that they are very strong, so you can wipe your life away and they do not rip easy. I use Softy wipes on my counter tops, in the bathroom and on my sons high chair. The uses are pretty much endless. I plan on trying these on our car on a warmer day. I plan on using these on our road trip to California because these can be used on pretty much anything including your body to give you the refreshed feeling. I am so happy I finally found a wipe that not only cleans, but keeps my hands soft.

I received this product for free in exchange for my opinion."	&&&
I buy Clorox wipes in bulk to save money and because I believe they are a fantasitic product.	&&&
These wipes save the day for me! Their are always finger prints or sticky stuff on the counter. My cat will walk across the counter. All of this can be fixed by sanitizing and looking and smelling clean again with the lemon clorox wipes! I even use them in my car!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes, after my family eats a meal or after I clean the kitchen, Clorox wipes are a great way to pick up the mess. Even the stove, especially with the grease! I couldn't imagine having a household without Clorox wipes in my house!	&&&
I love all clorox bran products. My favorite is the clorox glass wipes. They are hands down the best.	&&&
Great wipes. I tried generic and they would stretch and you would either end up with poop on your hands or need several wipes. These are gentle and clean well.	&&&
Love these thick wipes so much better than pampers	&&&
With a small child in school, I am ALWAYS needing to clean and disinfect. I use the Clorox wipes to school boxes, backpacks, and everything in between. I love the clean and fresh smell!	&&&
even my 13 year old daughter will use these wipes to clean her bathroom. they are smell great and are easy to use.	&&&
love this stuff its the only thing I will use and I love all the different uses of the wipes. the toilet bleach is amazing as well	&&&
So much better than any other wipes out there	&&&
"I ordered the Sani-Hands II Sanitizing Wipes with moisturizing aloe and Vitamin E in an attempt to find a hand sanitizer that truly did not damage your hands. These wipes are both disinfecting and moisturizing!. I have tried many brands that claim they moisturize and my hands end up cracked and flakey. I'm a little OCD and use the wipes quite often and these have provided me peace of mind while not damaging my skin. I plan on ordering several more canisters for both work and my home. I love them!!!"	&&&
"I really like these wipes. They make cleaning my house soooo much simpler
Awesome!!!"	&&&
i love Lysol wipes. kills germs and keeps my house clean. love coupons for lysol	&&&
"No kid likes to get their nose wiped and boogie wipes make it so easy to get dried boogies and to clear out the nose. I tried to use sailine drops but i couldnt hold my son still. These were amazing and the grape scent is so soothing, my fiance and I bought extra to use when we are sick. Best investment especially during cold and flu season."	&&&
I love this product. When we are all sick I use these wipes to disinfect all door knobs and counters. They help give me peace of mind because I know the germs are gone.	&&&
I love clorox disenfecting wipes for easy cleaning! The lemon scent is a little strong so I also like to buy the orange scent sometimes instead.	&&&
My husband is a massage therapist and swears by the disinfecting wipes to use at his office to keep things clean in between clients!	&&&
"I love the huggies wipes so of course I have to try all the accessories and this pouch is the perfect size! It has a strap for grab and go times and comes in different designes for some fun. The pouch keeps the wipes moist and ready for your little ones not so clean diapers. It also has a seal that is mom approved! Some items I have bought before broke open too easily so this makes me happy to know I can count on it. Some of you moms may like a larger wipe container especially if you have multiple ones in diapers so this pouch may not work for you as well. Hopefully they design one that comes in different sizes or even has an additional pocket to add a diaper or two for when you need to say a run for the restrooms. But all in all I am more than satisfied with it and hope you all give it a try. A+ from this mama!"	&&&
Sheets are bit thin and don't tear well from the container. The cleaning solution has a nice scent, but the wipes don't last long enough for me and I end up using lots more.	&&&
I love these wipes they have been great for years!	&&&
I love the smell, peace-of-mind, and clean results after using these wipes.	&&&
Not only do Clorox wipes smell fresh but they're convenient and easy to use too!	&&&
These are my least favorite wipes of all the brands I've tried. The texture is very stiff and there's minimal moisture, resulting in a wipe that's simply not very comfortable for rubbing on sensitive areas. Our 2 year old verifies this- after using these wipes for a week or two, she started loudly protesting and asking for "different wipes" each time we started doing a diaper change.	&&&
The clorox wipes are fast, easy and convenient to use and leaves a fresh clean scent. Definitely recommend.	&&&
Love that I can just pop open the top and pull out a wipe to disinfect anything and everything around the house! When you have a house full of people and pets, these wipes are a blessing!	&&&
Excellent, supper,duper, product... A trust worthy, time saver. I trust my health and family when I use these very practical; and handy, disinfecting wipes.	&&&
Great product!! I get these wipes all of the time to help me clean my home!	&&&
I've been using simple's Micellar water for a few months now. I was looking to reorder when I noticed they now had them in convenient wipes! THese are perfect. Gentle enough to use everyday, unlike most make up remover wipes. They clean my face thoroughly. I keep them by my bed so there's no excuse not to clean my face at night.	&&&
These wipes are wonderful. They do not rip easily and are thick. Love these wipes!!:)	&&&
Great wipes! Quick and easy.	&&&
I love these wipes I buy them all the time when I go to target	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. They are just as strong as any of the Huggies brand wipes, which I have come to expect, but they also smell awesome! I love how long the scent lasts but isn't overpowering and doesn't affect my baby boy's sensitive skin.	&&&
When my son has a runny nose or "a bat in the cave" (code word: boogie), these are the only things he will let me use on him to take card of business. Regular tissues are too scratchy for him, and the saline within these wipes helps soothe his nose inside and out. The fragrance is not too strong, and the 30 packs are just enough to not dry out in between uses. I've even been known to swipe a wipe myself.	&&&
We really like pampers wipes. They work great and have always been reliable and non-irritating on our babies skin. Yet, the "Baby Fresh" scent is not enjoyable to us. While it isn't so bad that it is unusable, we will not be purchasing additional Baby Fresh wipes once our supply is used up. We will be exclusively purchasing the Pampers "Natural Clean" scented wipes instead.	&&&
I admit I was skeptical when I first tried Boogie Wipes. My first thought was why not just use a baby wipe. I will tell you why. Because when your nose is raw from allergies and runny nose, nothing lights you on fire faster than a baby wipe. Just trust me on this, no need to prove it yourself!!! Painful! Boogie wipes are just wet enough to easily wipe away the crustiest noses (TMI maybe, but very needed with Little ones) but not soppy wet so they are uncomfortable. They absorb a surprising amount of snot, and when you have older LO's around 6 years old, they double as a baby wipe when you need that too. I don't go anywhere without a 30 pack of Boogie Wipes because my son is allergic to life, and his poor nose runs like a faucet AFTER 2 years of allergy shots. I love these so much they go in all new mom baskets I give as gifts!	&&&
I buy these for my Grandmother - and she is rather picky to say the least. So she gives them a '5 out of 5' rating. As do I. She has very very very sensitive skin. Hasn't had any problems so I am very pleased with that. :)	&&&
Ended up with moldy wipes. Returned and would not repurchase. Aside from the mold, the wipes were very cheaply made. They were like the very cheap toilet paper version of baby wipes. They did the job, but it took a lot more and weren't very comfortable.	&&&
I bought these as the "next stage up" from regular baby wipes. My kiddos have been long potty trained, but wiping seemed to always cause them some trouble. These wipes are amazing. They are strong enough to clean you well, without and poke through, and yet they are gentle enough not to cause any kind of discomfort or chafing. Best of all, my kids are able to get themselves much cleaner that with just plain ol' toilet paper! I keep these stocked in my bathroom, not only for m y kiddos to use, but for my hubs and myself as well! They are far better than other brands too! These are, BY FAR, the best flushable wipes out there!!! Thanks Kandoo!	&&&
I don't have children because I can't afford the massive black hole of a financial drain that would be for me, but I love diaper wipes for removing makeup. I also use them after using to toilet because they're gentle enough to not irritate my skin like pretty much all feminine wipes. There's not really much more I can say about basic diaper wipes other than the fact that they don't shred or fall apart and they're nice and moist. This deal is pretty awesome compared to the bulk packages I found anywhere else. I will decidedly be purchasing again.	&&&
We received a sample packet of the Fresh Scent Boogie Wipes just after I had my daughter so we figured we would give them a try. After trying Boogie Wipes we will not even consider using a regular tissue for her again. She loves the Boogie Wipes and even tries to wipe her own nose using them!	&&&
We've purchased Boogie Wipes since I gave birth to my son two years ago and thank the heavens for these wipes! I have such a stubborn little guy who hates having his nose wiped, I mean meltdown and fit throwing! However he will let me clean his nose with Boogie Wipes and loves to help mommy and daddy clean our noses. They've been a heaven scent this flu season and even my husband loves them!	&&&
I am very pleased with the quality of Wiki Wags! I adopted a male Yorkie who is 8 years old and only used for breeding. Obviously he was not house broken. He is such a love and is so happy to be able to go for walks and be in a home. I don't have to worry about him lifting his leg (which he does) on my furniture! Love love love Wiki Wags disposable male dog wraps!! Thank you!	&&&
My girls are so sensitive and so when it comes to using the best for them and keeping them rash free we always choose Pampers Sensitive whipes!	&&&
I like to keep my car clean, inside and out. But it's not easy to find a product that will effectively clean your car and not ruin the material. Armor All products are great for caring for you car. I especially love Armor All Cleaning Wipes. These come packaged as single dispensing towels, similar to an antibacterial cleaning wipes. They are pre-moistened with cleaner for convenient cleaning. They are good for getting into all the nooks and crannies of your car where all the dust hides. They don't leave a lot of suds behind, so there's not really any need to follow up with a dry towel, unless you are near the end of the container, where all the liquid resides. These can be a bit expensive, but you can usually find them on sale. Armor All Cleaning Wipes are my preferred cleaning product for cars because they are convenient and can clean most surfaces in the car (minus the windows).	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! its all I use for my daughter since she was born. they smell fantastic and keep my daughters bum smooth and clean! I recommend these to all my friends and when they smell them they are automatically sold! also anytime I go to a baby shower im sure to include a package of these wipes in the gift!	&&&
"Good quality of wipes
Very fast delivering to my house"	&&&
These makeup wipes are amazing... I like throwing one in my gym bag, one in my car, purse, and desk at work! They do not dry out and they are so convenient. They also make my skin feel great!	&&&
Pampers wipes leave my daughter clean with using fewer wipes.	&&&
Nice smell, worked well, and more Eco packaged than the individually wrapped mat wipes other brands sell. Only drawback is they aren't as thick as I would of hoped - they are pretty thin.	&&&
I love these wipes. Best decision ive made when it comes to getting my babys little behind clean. My husband has even made comments of how he prefers these over regular wipes which are more rough. I agree. These are perfectly soft to the touch. Im not too fond of the scent. I prefer no scent at all but its tolerable. No biggy. Excellent product for babys sensitive booty.	&&&
I remember when Handi Wipes hit the market, back in the 60s when "disposable" was "in". As I got more environmentally conscious, I stopped using them. Recently, my kids and I revisited that decision. We looked at how often we washed our dishcloths, how frequently we had to bleach them, how often we had to replace them, how many paper towels it took to wipe up spills, etc. We realized that this pack of Handi Wipes will last us at least two years, replace rolls of paper towels, and eliminate about a quart of detergent/bleach over that same period. I'm sure we missed something in our simple thinking, but it seems like in this case the convenient solution makes sense. I suspect they're made from synthetic fibers, not cotton, but the weight of the whole pack is about the same as a couple of empty detergent/bleach bottles. These cloths are much more durable than I expected. We've found them to be a perfect middle ground between stinky dishcloths and one-shot paper towels. I guess some ideas from the 60s were pretty good after all.	&&&
Honestly, these are the best face wipes I've ever found. One wipe took off my full face of makeup and left my skin nice and soft. The scent is very mild but nice and it did not irritate my face nor my eyes. I will continue to buy these again and again.	&&&
I love my "Lysol dual action disinfecting wipes" these little things work like magic! I always make sure I have these on hand, I use them to clean just about everything. The Lysol wipes state that they can clean and kill up to 99.9% of germs! Anyone that has children knows that cleanliness is a big deal in the household and on the go. I keep a container of them in my car and my bathroom. They work well for cleaning up messes, as well as disinfecting things such as handles on doors, sinks, toilets, and counter tops. I also use them to clean carts at the store before the kids get in them. One of my favorite things about these disinfecting wipes is how thick they are, I can clean all of my counter tops in the kitchen with ONE wipe! I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially if you have a germ phobia like I do. Great product!	&&&
Great for sensitive skin and it has no scent (Y) .	&&&
Awesome product!	&&&
A friend of mine introduced me to boogie wipes a couple years ago and I'm so glad she did. My daughter loves using them because they do not irritate her nose like regular tissues.	&&&
My sister bought me this great scent boogie wipes I used them for me grandson love them.	&&&
I love these wipes because the packaging is great and when I pull them out I don't get the side eye from the kids because they know it's Boogie Wipes. I trust Boogie Wipes products because they don't irritate the kids skin. The kids love them because they smell so good. These are by far the best wipes around.	&&&
wish this product was still available at the local store. product is good and will continue to purchase	&&&
Convenient wipes...my jewelry was in sad shape and I got some luster back, but probably needed a stronger product to bring it back to like new shine. So if your sterling needs just a touch up, try this.	&&&
I absolutely fell in love with this product whenmy 9 year old was a toddler! Now i have a two year old and there's nothing worse than trying to fight sticky boogers with a kleenex! Boogie wipes is a simple swipe to clean that nasty mess and i love it!	&&&
"These are so gentle on the nose! I also got the spray!"	&&&
"Review for Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes
I got these for a very good deal and could not be happier. I always know what to expect with Huggies and I am always satisfied with my purchase."	&&&
We love these wipes! I use them on my two year old and my seven year old still likes to use them. For some reason I always find it hard to wipe little behinds with toilet paper, but with these wipes it's easy. They are the perfect size. I love that they have a sensitive version for my sensitive skin boys.	&&&
I use these glorious wipes for everything!!!! My son doesn't like when I try to wipe his nose and/or face, but I soon as he sees me pull out these little purple bag of magic he says, "yummy, grapes!" I highly recommend these wipes- and ladies, I use theme to remove my eyeliner!	&&&
My husband and I purchase wipes in bulk, so they do not come in/with a case that allows for ease of use at the changing station. This wipe container is made of solid BPA free plastic, and the simple design allows for the wipes to stay moist and pull out one at a time (is the wipe brands allows). Overall, this is a great buy for those who want a true wipe container.	&&&
Very disappointed . All the wipes were dry. Would not buy again.	&&&
I love using the disinfecting wipes for easy cleaning of my counters, sink, and other surfaces!	&&&
Bought these a day before my water frozed. I wanted to cleaned and remembered I had bought these wipes. I was so amazed how they cleaned up my kitchen cabinets and stove. I then, began to take them in to the restrooms and cleaned the cabinets and even the toilets with them. This wipes are very durable and pick up anything. I was so thankful for them and how they made my day with frozen water, but a clean house. The sad thing was is that it was the last pack Staples had on the shelve. but now the weather is warming up and I have water, I am going back to hopefully find more..... thank you so much.	&&&
These wipes are okay. They do the job and that's all I can say about them. I buy them because when they go on sale they are a good value. However, I do like the Natural Care wipes better in this brand because they are thicker so I would prefer those but in the end I usually buy whichever ones are a better price. I also like the Pampers Sensitives wipes better then these because those are also thicker. However, these aren't too bad and still do the job.	&&&
This is a great product. Love the wipes. They are very convenient and clean and disinfect well. Thanks for a great product.	&&&
These wipes are so convenient to use and they do an amazing job cleaning just about every room in my home.	&&&
I love love love Clorox wipes. I use these for everything. From basic wiping off toys and countertops to cleaning counters and the toilet. These are great and the other brand just can't compare!!	&&&
I usually use the Clorox wipes and they are wonderful for disinfecting.	&&&
Wow, my husband can be a bit messy....and these little wipes do their job even better than I could ever imagine!!!	&&&
I LOVE the disinfecting wipes. They make it so easy to quickly and efficiently clean my kitchen and bathrooms. I keep one canister under each sink for convenience. Just pull one out, wipe down the surfaces, and throw them in the trash. How much easier could it be!!!	&&&
These wipes stand up against any mess or spill. I have never had one tear and the cleaning power is phenomenal	&&&
We all know the ridiculous amount of wipes we go through and this is a great value. The wipes themselves are strong and moist without being dripping wet. Love the product!	&&&
I love using the Clorox disinfecting wipes. It makes it too easy too do a simple wipe down of my bathroom every day.	&&&
These wipes work great to clean everyday messes in my kitchen and bathroom especially. I use them everyday.	&&&
I love the easy use of the Clorox Wipes.The Lemon scent is just enough of a scent.	&&&
loveee your wipes! it makes cleaning much more enjoyable especially with the different scents that goes with it.	&&&
we like to use wipes in the bathroom but some of us are allergic to the typical brands out there. this stuff is great. no problems at all!	&&&
The pampers baby wipes are the best wipes. One of my kids has ezcema and these are perfect and wont make him break out. Love that i can purchase the small travel bag to keep in my diaper bag and the big box to refill my at home wipe dispenser. They are extremely soft and gentle that i even use them to clean my face.	&&&
Clorox wipes are easy to use, smell great and are affordable.	&&&
I love clorox wipes! Nothing compares to them when it comes to convenience and effectiveness.	&&&
I love lysol wipes, I use them all the time to clean my home.	&&&
Literally the best disinfectant wipes on the market. No other better brand!	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes because they are so convenient but I also know it's getting the job done!	&&&
These wipes make it so easy to clean and disinfect! I use them for everything all the time!	&&&
Pampers wipes are the best. They do not leave flakes on my daughter like other brands that I have tried. Plus they are a great value if you buy them at Sam's Club with Pampers Diapers while they have instant savings. They usually are $10 off when you buy the diapers and wipes together.	&&&
I don't know what it is, but ever since I started using this product (since Sept. '14), my skin has felt and looked so clean, and has been free of break outs! I've used other face wipes before but these wipes feel great on my skin and they smell so good! Not to mention, these wipes remove all my make up--yes, even waterproof eyeliner & mascara-- so easily! I would like to buy this product in bulk, so someone please tell me where I can do that!&#x 21; Love this product and Aveeno in general =)	&&&
I love the Clorox disinfecting wipes! I love having a container of them on my counter when I'm cooking so when I'm done cutting vegetables or meat I can grab a wipe to clean up! Disinfects an cleans at the same time!! And leaves a great scent behind! :)Convenient!!!	&&&
I am a classroom aide. Clorox Disinfecting wipes are perfect for quick clean ups between classes	&&&
I don't usually review products because I just expect things to work as promised. If a product lives up to its purpose that should be the standard. We've also tried all sorts of wipes because my husband and I prefer different features. So we've bought top of the line organic/natural all the way to big name standards, and we had yet to settle on buying a case of one brand more than once. These wipes however are really outstanding. They're big, tough & effective yet gentle, and they have just the right amount of moisture to make cleaning really easy but not leave a bunch of product on my baby. I've recommended these to all my friends. I just wish they made an option with a smaller count. These are HUGE (and while handy at home), not real convenient for travel or the diaper bag. I hope Amazon plans on making a "travel size", I'd buy those as well.	&&&
I use these wipes in my dorm room to disinfect. Work great and are convenient to use.	&&&
Love these vs Huggies wipes. Much softer, grabs more of the mess with fewer wipes. Smell great, never dry. Also, I put them into our wipe warmer and they feed great. The huggies would always come undone after every 10 wipes and I'd have to re-feed.	&&&
These are my go-to wipes especially after a big home cooked meal that basically bombs the kitchen. With all white cabinetry & white stove I love the wipes mainly because they don't lose their moisture! So one or two do the whole job. I've tried the generic off brand "equivalent' & they don't stand a chance.	&&&
ive always used Clorox wipes very fast and easy and gets the job done	&&&
I like these wipes. This is the only kind I've purchased in the last three years and I have two kids under age 4, and a nephew I babysit who is 18 months old. I feel like these wipes have a nice feel to them, and they really cut through the crud pretty well. They aren't too thin, like the cheap-o store brands. Huggies has nice, thick wipes, but I feel like it's such a waste for most diaper jobs! Don't throw away your money on that. Get these ones. I like the Huggies wipes containers, so I just buy that and use these to refill them, LOL! Also, baby wipes are surprisingly good at getting stains off of weird places.	&&&
I like that the wipes do not get caught when pulling out and if they do it is a simple fix.	&&&
I love clorox wipes. They are so easy to use and I love that they disinfect.	&&&
With a house full of kids it is always nice to have quick and easy options for cleaning up spills and disinfecting. Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are my go to when illness hits. Works great on light switches and door knobs.	&&&
I love the wipes so you can clean up after my grandchildren, and husband.	&&&
Our family loves using Clorox wipes and Clorox products. The smell left behind is also a plus!	&&&
These wipes are super convenient and keep my kitchen and bath clean. They are easy to use and my kids like to clean with them also.	&&&
I really love the Clorox wipes they get the job done, and there are plenty!	&&&
I love the convenience of Clorox wipes. It is so much easier to just grab a wet wipe than to have to use messy sprays.	&&&
I m a teacher and I love the ease of the wipes. It is a lot easier than using sprays.	&&&
I love clorox wipes they are easy and simple to use. I have 3 boy under 5 and they really help make clean up easy and sanitary and even can let my oldesy help while supervised.	&&&
Clorox wipes are my go to cleaner. I use them in the kitchen, bath and anywhere I need powerful cleaning. They are easy to use by placing a canister in bath and kitchen.	&&&
I love using Clorox Wipes on all my surfaces at home. Especially since there is so many virus and flu going around.	&&&
If you have pets you need clorex wipes there is nothing better.	&&&
Love the easiness to clean with the wipes...fast easy and effective	&&&
I love these clorox wipes. you can never have too many of them I keep them in the house, car, work etc. I would definitely recommend since flu season is here.	&&&
I love the ease of using the wipes to clean up messes. And the kids are able to clean up their messes as well!	&&&
We love lysol wipes! we use them on all our hard surfaces! So convenient when in the camper, easy to store and use.	&&&
I am a mother of two toddler boys and I use Clorox wipes on everything. they are convenient and easy to use and do the job well!	&&&
clorax wipes are a great way to clean and disenfect your countertops.	&&&
The clorox lemon wipes are convenient to use and powerful on crud. No need to sprays or rags.. One stop motion!. Excellent product.	&&&
I think I have a Clorox wipes container in just about every room in my house except the bedrooms. Seriously, we keep the travel packs in our cars, too. Best invention ever!	&&&
I love these wipes. The ingredients are so simple, I don't have to worry about causing irritation on my baby's skin. The practical side of me feels that it is a bit excessive to pay more for wipes that are almost entirely water, but making my own would be more of a hassle than it's worth, and I don't like using cloth wipes, so these are a great option for busy working moms like me who still want to use natural products but don't have a lot of time.	&&&
LOVE Clorox anything! I have 3 children and do daycare and these are my go to wipes to clean anything and everything! The texture on the wipes is great for scrubbing surfaces and I only need one to clean my counters! Great quality at a great value!	&&&
"I am a fair skinned red head that can't tan to save her life, so if I want a tan I have to either go to a salon and get the spray tan or I have to do it myself. I have done them all and I have to say that while doing it yourself is cheaper and a little more convenient it does not work out very well sometimes. I have turned orange and be streaky that I wouldn't leave my house until it wore off. However, with these tanning wipes I don't have to worry about any of that. This is the first kind of tanning wipes that I have used that actually look really great. Not only does it not make you look freaky orange but it's pretty hard to make it streaky because you are just wiping it on your skin. It's super easy to use and I can pull out the wipes when I need them from the box. I like to keep things neat and organized in my closet and I like that I can poke the hole out from the side and just pull the packs out when I want them. The best thing about these though is how well they work on my arms and legs. It doesn't take forever to apply and dries pretty quick too. Another great thing is that most of these wipes come in packs of like 6 or if you're lucky 10 but this pack comes with 20 which is way more bang for your buck. Not only are you getting a great product but more for the price. Couldn't be better.

I love these wipes for my little guy's sensitive skin. They have no perfumes or dyes and they're soft on his bum and little bits. Tha packaging sucks, but I just pull out a couple before I start to change his diaper. Unfortunately it looks as though Amazon isn't carrying them anymore and not living in the U.S. really limits where I can find products. I'm so disappointed, Amazon!	&&&
"When I'm in a hurry I love to use clorox wipes or if I just need to clean a small mess.
It would be great if they were just a little thicker. The durability is great though!"	&&&
"These self tanning wipes are great! I love that they are half body wipes - they are easier to manage and they won't dry out before I can get to my whole body.

Packaging: 5/5 The little dispenser box is a nice touch. The wipes are individually wrapped, so if you want to take them somewhere you don't have to worry about leaking or bringing a big bottle of something with you.

Application/Use: 4.5/5 It is a wipe, I think we can all use a wipe! The only thing that I can critique is that because the formula goes on clear, it can be a bit hard to tell where you have applied. This can get tricky around the knees, ankles, and elbows where you always need to be careful with self tanner.

Smell: 5/5 This self tanner seriously has no odor. Some people like the smell of self tanner and some people hate it, but you don't have to worry.

Color: 5/5 The Glow2Go wipes developed a nice, natural brown color - no orange at all! I tanned one leg and did not tan the other just to compare. I thought this would be better than a before and after because the lighting in the room may be different, etc. I started to see results after about 4 hours, but the tan reached its full color after about 12 hours.

Overall: 4.8/5 Look at those results! I really really like these wipes! They were super easy to use, the color looks really nice, they don't smell and they didn't rub off on anything.

Thermalabs provided me with this product in exchange for my honest opinion."	&&&
I have been using this product for a very long time. It is a good value for the price. Everything I clean with the wipes is fresh and disinfected. Recommend highly.	&&&
I like the wipes as a quick disposable way to clean and disinfect!	&&&
I love the huggies wipes so of course I have to try all the accessories and this pouch is the perfect size! It has a strap for grab and go times and comes in different designes for some fun. The pouch keeps the wipes moist and ready for your little ones not so clean diapers. It also has a seal that is mom approved! Some items I have bought before broke open too easily so this makes me happy to know I can count on it. Some of you moms may like a larger wipe container especially if you have multiple ones in diapers so this pouch may not work for you as well. Hopefully they design one that comes in different sizes or even has an additional pocket to add a diaper or two for when you need to say a run for the restrooms. But all in all I am more than satisfied with it and hope you all give it a try. A+ from this mama!	&&&
love these wipes. convenient and gets the job done the way i want..disinfected	&&&
I trust the Clorox line of products. Love the wipes!	&&&
These wipes make cleaning much easier and more efficient! I love them and highly recommend them.	&&&
I have tried other wipes and came back to Clorox Disinfecting Wipes because of the excellent cleaning power. Clorox wipes clean so much better! Can't be beat.	&&&
I love buying Clorox Wipes because you can use them anywhere in the home; bathroom, kitchen, dining table, etc. I also feel like with a brand like Clorox I know I am truly cleaning an disinfecting the surface.	&&&
Clorox wipes are my absolute favorite for cleaning my home!	&&&
what happened to the wipes i loved? i had used this wipes since i had kids and never had a problem with it. Now with the last 2 purchases I did, i am definitely not buying another. It really makes me sick to my stomach how awful the smell is coming out of the wipes. Its too bad. I had loved this wipes.	&&&
I'm really impressed with these wipes! We've been using them for over a month now, and I think I've found my new brand to use. My boys have very sensitive skin and get diaper rashes occasionally due to food intolerances, so I have to be very careful what I use on them. These work amazing! We still had a pack of the old wipes we used lying around, and when I change my 2 year old he always tells me he doesn't want the old wipes, he wants the new ones.	&&&
I love using the Clorox wipes because they are very convenient for all levels of mess.	&&&
with 6 children clorox disinfection wipes are used daily in our household. we love that you wipe and go and disinfect everything at the same time.	&&&
I like the Clorox Lemon Wipes because they smell good but not too over powering. They are also less sloppy that the competitor wipes. All this and a great disinfecting wipe too.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. They are the best when cleaning big and small jobs. They help to make my job as mom easier.	&&&
I absolutly looooove clorox products. I use clorox wipes on EVERYTHING. I may be obsessed.	&&&
I have a leather chair & ottoman. The ottoman needs and gets most maintenance. I have always used the liquid protector but decided to try the convenience of wipes. The package contains 20 wipes. I used 5--just to do the ottoman's top--and did not get as good a result. I also found them hard to hold and they left pieces (like tissue paper "pills"). I am re-ordering the liquid (which takes more effort but gives much better results).	&&&
For the busy mom on the go, the health of my family is always important. Clorox disinfecting wipes ensures that I can get the job down with ease. Kills germs fast...	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They are really easy to use. I recently had a baby. I love to wipe his toys and things down with these wipes to clean them.	&&&
i love clorox wipes. i always use them to clean up. thanks so much	&&&
I buy clorox wipes all the time. I use them to clean everything! Whenever I use them I feel good about knowing that i am not only keeping my house clean but keeping my family safe from germs.	&&&
"ShowerPill Athletic Body Wipes are a LIFESAVER. I am an ultra runner, yogi, fitness instructor and busy founder of two companies. So as you can probably imagine, I am ALWAYS on the move. The wipes work for me in between runs, yoga classes and everything in between. They are the perfect solution to clean up post sweat sessions when you don't have time for an actual shower. ;)

My go to fitness product. LOVE. LOVE. Can't live without them."	&&&
"Love disinfecting wipes these were on sale plus I used a coupon so I felt like I got them for free. They smell great and the wipes are sturdy. Good product well worth the money I spent."	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use when I have a big mess!	&&&
These wipes are convenient! I keep them in the bathroom for a quick clean up, in the car for travel (nasty rental cars), camping trips, school outings, etc.	&&&
I love the clorox wipes. So easy to clean with and I love knowing that it really is clean.	&&&
I love the convenience of Clorox wipes, with three young kids, I am always cleaning up some kind of mess. With Clorox I know it will be disinfected, it gives me peace of mind.	&&&
i love these color wipes especially the orange smelling ones!	&&&
Clorox wipes are my favorite because there is two pre teens and a teen in my house and when they're all home it gets pretty messy. Clorox helps disinfect and clean without the hassle.	&&&
I don't particularly like these wipes. They sort of do the job, but they're VERY strongly baby powder scented, which makes my Boston Terrier sneeze and try to get away from them. She then smells perfumed instead of clean. They're also not nearly wet enough, so I end up using a bunch just to clean her, even when she was only 2.5 pounds! I ended up buying Earthbath's All Natural Puppy Grooming Wipes (also on Amazon) and I love those!	&&&
Hard to get the wipes out. They break every single time, and I end up removing the lid to reach the wipes. Not ordering again.	&&&
i have 3 kids and I love using the Clorox products, especially the wipes they are so handy for all their little and big messes.	&&&
these wipes are the best they clean and sanitize and shine mirrors as well great product	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are great for everything! They make everyday spills and clean up a breeze!	&&&
the wipes are so easy to use. My boys can help me clean! Sarah B Cashmere WA	&&&
AT FIRST I WAS EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL ABOUT BUYING THESE LYSOL DISINFECTING WIPES 3 PACK VARIETY BECAUSE I NORMALLY BUY CLOREX DISINFECTING WIPES IN THE VARITEY 3 PACK. AMAZINGLY TO MY SURPRISE, THE LYSOL DISINFECTING WIPES WORKED JUST AS WELL AS MY CLOREX DISINFECTING WIPES. I CANT SAY THAT ONE IS BETTER AN THE OTHER, BUT I CAN SAY THAT THEY WORK VERY WELL AND DID THE JOB THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSE TO DO.THE ONLY DRAW BACK IS THAT THE CANTAINERS THAT THEY COME IN ARE ALOT SMALLER THAN THE CLOREX."}}];	&&&
I love to purchase Clorox wipes and use them for many different things such as in the kitchen and bathroom.	&&&
We love using clorox wipes and the clorox spray cleaner. They are affordable and easy to use. Its been a brand we trust since i was little and now my kids will too!	&&&
I love using the wipes to make sure surfaces are clean.	&&&
I never was able to find a disinfectant that would get a stain out of my carpet, not even resolve did it but I tried Clorox disinfectant wipes and i was in love!!!! I never found anything that worked like this before. I will never ever go back. I feel if you get all three scents, the yellow, green or the orange, they all smell great but the green one works the best on getting stains out.	&&&
These work great and are a nice size (not gigantic but not small; one at a time works just fine). The packaging is very tight though and my kids couldn't get the wipes out so I switched them to an old wipes box we had on hand. I will be buying these exclusively. They are great!	&&&
Always use Clorox wipes to clean the sinks and toilets in the bathroom. So convenient.	&&&
I love clorox wipes, I like the convenience of the cleaner and wipe.	&&&
I use the Clorox lemon wipes for just about all of my kitchen cleaning. They work great for cleaning up dog messes and leaves everything smelling nice. Great product!	&&&
Clorox wipes are perfect for wiping down surfaces.	&&&
I like using the Clorox wipes because they are convenient and easy to use to disinfect my kitchen couuntertops after using raw meat.	&&&
I keep clorox wipes in the kitchen and the bathroom for quick clean ups. Especially during cold and flu season, I am constantly wiping everything down to remove the germs brought home from school and work.	&&&
Clorox wipes are wonderful when I have someone sick in my house to wipe all of the hard surfaces down. They are quick and easy to use.	&&&
Love using Clorox wipes in the bathroom and in the kitchen. It just feels clean.	&&&
Easy Clean Up! Great disinfectant. Strong wipes. Great Product can use for most of your cleaning.	&&&
Clorox wipes are perfect for families who involve children in the cleaning process! No mess and no waste!!	&&&
HUGGIES Natural Care Wipes are the only wipes that I buy for my 4 month old. We found out early on, that he has quite a few allergies and from that moment on, I decided to be most careful when choosing his baby products. I buy three or four cases of these wipes at a time. They are thick and gentle, and they get even the messiest diaper changes done with just one or two wipes. I actually still have a ton of other brand wipes left over from my shower. I have used a couple, but always seem to go back to HUGGIES Natural Care because we love them so much. I would definitely recommend these wipes for newborns, babies with sensitive skin or rashes, or any other baby out there. Hope this helps!! 	&&&
"The warmer does its job of keepinbg the wipes warm but it is extremely frustrating that the next wipe does not come through the opening. You have to open the "refill compartment" to get the wipes out."	&&&
"I have 3 dogs when they go outside they always end all muddy. These were my saving grace because I was going to go crazy trying to keep mud out of my house. They are very durable and strong which I love! Its my easier to wipe a big dogs paws when the wipe is durable so it doesn't rip and end up making more of a mess. My dogs also have very sensitive skin, so these being natural it doesn't bother or irritate my dogs skin at all. They smell amazing! I highly recommend these to anyone with a pet, they are great and you will for sure use them ALOT!
I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion."	&&&
Not long ago we bought the sensitive wipes, after our four year old requested them. The wipes give him more confidence in wiping than regular toilet paper. Still, it is more expensive than we like.	&&&
I purchase Boogie Wipes when I go to the grocery store. I take then everywhere with me, they come in handy for just about everything. My son loves them as well.	&&&
The adults in my house use this more than the children. These wipes are cheaper than the flushable wipes marketed towards adults, and work just as well. They're a winner in my book.	&&&
My daughter has had multiple issues with skin and allergies to certain products, that when I walked into Walmart one day an saw these wipes, I decided to try them. As a mom I would anything for my kids even one that was so allergic to things that she was on a vegan diet. These wipes were natural and sooooo wonderful when my daughter has a "crusty nose" when she had a cold. Its very moist and smells really good. From the day I used this item on her nose she now ask me for her boogie wipes. Its so great that I also have asked her daycare to use them. Thank you boogie wipes from a parent that struggles to find natural products everyday for a child with severe allergies.	&&&
Worked great on my stainless steel appliances...I hate fingerprints on them..problem solved!	&&&
My daughter has high functioning Autism. She has sensory issues and regular tissues bother her. She cannot handle the texture against her nose. Boogie Wipes solved this issue. She doesn't argue with me when she needs to wipe her nose anymore. This is definitely a lifesaver. She is a teenager and it is socially inappropriate for her to go around with a runny, snotty nose. Without Boogie Wipes she would have more social issues than normal.	&&&
Clean, slightly medicinal smell that quickly dissipates after use - which is perfect. The wipes are larger than many other brands and hold up to a bit of scrubbing, too. You definitely have a just-washed feeling after use, and no residue (or sweat, oil, or dirt) is left behind. Instead, you just have cool, clean skin. Definitely recommend for people who can't get to a shower after a workout, as something to take along while camping, etc.	&&&
Love these wipes so much. I keep them on hand for when the grandkids come. They love the grape scented ones best, so do i	&&&
Although these are great for everyday and I carry a package with me wherever I go, my family really fell in love with this product when we all had colds...no sore, red noses when using boogie wipes! Don't know how we functioned before Boogie Wipes!!!	&&&
The Boogies wipes are amazing! They are so soft on noses and keeps them from drying out. My kids would be afraid of blowing their noses because it would hurt when they got dry. These are so gentle on their noses. I also use them when I get sick. Really helps the constant blowing.	&&&
"I never heard what boogie wipes were until my one girlfriend used them. I though she was nuts that's what Kleenex are for. Until I had a child of my own. I truly understand why she would ravve about them. I refuse
To not have these in my diaper bag and in my closet at home. With my son being 17 months he hates having his face wipes off but with the boogie wipes it truly is no hassle. I am able to get his runni noise or dried up offers from over night in seconds, he doesn't even have time to react.
I tell all my from friends about these even got my mom and mother in law hooked to them. One item I will NEVER live without"	&&&
I don't like the smell of these and prefer the thickness of Huggies wipes.	&&&
When my son Noah has a runny nose Boogie Wipes are our best friend! Boogie Wipes will gently remove dried boogies and can be used over and over to wipe those runny little baby noses without drying out skin! (I USE THEM MYSELF TOO)! These wipes smell delicious and they are very moist! Definitely something parents with children need to try!	&&&
I bought these Kandoo Wipes about a week ago because my kids have sensitive skin. My 2 year old still has to use baby shampoo and body wash because if not he breaks out with a terrible rash all over. My 5 year old has a skin condition and if it gets to cold it breaks out even more or if she sweats too much. I use these wipes to clean them up after they eat because if I use a wet rag then there faces turn red. I am beyond happy I found these wipes they have been a blessing.	&&&
I started using these a few months ago and boy I wish I would have started using them sooner! These are perfect for getting all the nasty snot and boogie's from my kids nose and mouth. I really love the fact that it gently removes the hard crusty stuff so easily without irritating my daughters nose. We use these wipes religiously. I highly recommend these to anyone who has kids.	&&&
Ok, take a look at me. I don't use thses BUT..my daughter the "make-up guru" was waiting fir thenm. When they arrived, they were quickly opened and she ruched to the bathroom mirror with one sheet. She returned with a dirtied one from make-up, proclaiming, "these work great." She went on and on, no bad smell, no tingle, "these are great. And the price is right. What more can you say? Now many washes later, still happy, and the wife is using them too. RECOMMENDED	&&&
I use Pampers wipes all the time. They wipe my baby clean with ease and they have a fresh scent. They are durable and do not feel like they are going to fall apart while I use them.	&&&
Used one, not what I expected. Will take on trips where a shower is not available. Most likely won't purchase again.	&&&
This products is great and it just as described. I use them with my gel nails/gel nail polish and they do not leave any lint behind.	&&&
We were looking for wipes that don't have all the chemicals in them and these are pretty good. I like how thick they are and the only thing is I wish they smelled better. However, I'd rather they smell the way they do than have them smell really good and be rubbing nasty chemicals all over my infants bottom. These are great if you are concerned about diaper rash, eczema or prefer to purchase baby items that are fragrance and chemical free.	&&&
I love kandoo wipes. They are easy to grab out of the container. My kids can get themselves clean without a big mess and just throw the wipe in the toilet when their done. Great product.	&&&
We really love these wipes as our baby girl has very sensitive skin!	&&&
These are rough on baby's skin, we used to use these but after packaging changes the wipes just aren't the same, we used the Huggies natural ones now and they are much softer.	&&&
These are just a few great words to describe this product. I recently bought two sets of these for my son, one of the white the other with the blue castle pattern. The later keeps getting softer after each wash. My son's skin cannot handle regular store bought wet wipes, so I bought these. He is 10 months and I use these for all of his messes! Spit up, food all over his face, and to of course wipe his butt! All of mine are still the original color and surprisingly have not stain at all. I was them 2 - 3 times a week, these are wonderful especially for a cheap price!!	&&&
I love these things and cannot imagine my life without them for my daughter! Babies do not do tissues and these not only dissolve nose-crusties, they allow you to get a good grip.	&&&
My little guy has some skin sensitivity these wipes are prefect for that. Since we started using these he doesn't have the red around his bum anymore.	&&&
We bought one package of these wipes and they were great. I ordered three more. When we took them out of the package the first set smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke. The other two sets smelled very strongly of perfume. It says that these are sewn by stay at home moms and grandmas. Well whichever mom or grandma sewed the three that we got probably smoked and wore lots of perfume. We returned these - organic products should not have unorganic smells like perfume and cigarette smoke permeating the wipes!	&&&
These wipes are just the best! We love them and it's all we use!	&&&
I absolutely love the "Clorox brand lemon fresh disinfecting wipes" Not only do they smell amazing and clean, but they work like a charm. They kill 99.9% of germs, which really comes in handy when flu season comes around. I love the fact that you can buy these disinfecting wipes in three different sized containers. You can buy big tubs, smaller tubs and travel packs. I always have a small pack of them in my purse and diaper bag for on the go. They also work very well on counters for removing stains, spills and dirt. Clorox is a brand we truly trust in my family, they never disappoint and work very well at killing bacteria and germs. I highly recommend these disinfecting wipes to ANYONE!	&&&
This was a good purchase for me for I love the product. When I was first introduced to this product when I was shopping at Sam's Club store. When I went to purchase some more, I found out that the store didn't carry it anymore. I then went to customer service & was told that It was only available for purchase on-line. I am not particularly fond of making purchases on-line, but I did want the product, so I did order 4 boxes on-line. I am hoping by the time I need the product again, that it will be back in the store. Thanks, Barbara B Bell	&&&
I received a sample of this product. Two very large and very very moist towelettes. Problem 1. My eyes are burning. Literally burning. Im tearing as I write this :( Problem 2. My face feels sticky. Like if I put water on it im afraid a bubble will appear. Get the sample and see for yourself.	&&&
I LOVE this product! I have Always gotten these, mainly because they are thick, strong, soft, and wonderful at getting my little one clean. The price is great, and I really like that I can purchase many in a case.	&&&
Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean, no oily film, no burning sting. The smooth side it great for makeup around your eyes.	&&&
"I like to keep wipes around the kitchen and bathroom because I feel like I need to disinfect and sanitize on occasion. The kitchen usually has raw food messes and other food messes on the stove, countertop, and even the table. The bathroom usually has messes on the sinks and around the toilet.

I bought these because they were on sale and I thought I would try them instead of the regular Lysol wipes I usually grab.

The container with this is convenient because it closes and keeps the wipes moist but getting the first wipe up and out of the spout was a little annoying. After that, it's smooth sailing. The wipes have a soft side and they have a side that has little scrubbers on it. I like the scrubbers because I can sanitize my kitchen and bathroom areas at the same time I scrub them to get up stuck on food or stains around the areas I am cleaning. The scrubbing power could be better but it's nice to have it added to wipes I would be purchasing anyway. I like the idea of a clean home and being able to tackle kitchen messes and keep my family safe. The smell on this is still kind of chemically but it has a fresh lemon scent to it that the traditional wipes have. It's a good product to use if you cook a lot and the range and microwave need frequent cleaning."	&&&
We have tried many other brands and none have come close to the quality of Pampers. They smell good and are gentle on my daughter. We will never use anything else.	&&&
It's a wipe, it does what it's supposed to do and is chlorine free. Dispensing was very frusterating especially in the middle of the night when I'm changing diapers with one eye open. One does not follow the other and when you reach in to pinch out another wipe you can get one you can get five. I chose another company after this purchase and am much happier with their product.	&&&
"I purchased a bunch of Method products when I realized what they had to offer. We decided to go all natural and organic a little at a time and I immediately switched out a lot of our cleaners with eco products. I used to use Lysol and Clorox wipes and on occasion still am guilty of using them but every chance I get, I try to buy these from Method.

The Method wipes don't have the chemically smell my old wipes do. These have an earthy scent to them and a very lemony scent that I love. It actually smells like a natural lemon.

I like that these have a little bit of grip to the wipes. The wipes have the germ fighting power that I need. They clean up flu viruses and salmonella which are the two that I am most concerned about in my household. The wipes pick up a lot of dirt and food grime left behind when I clean with them and that's an added bonus."	&&&
"These wipes work great for cleaning pump parts on the go. The BIG downside is the cost. But, they were worth it on our recent road trip when I had to pump in the car while we drove. Would never use them for day-to-day, but they're awesome in certain circumstances."	&&&
These packets are very lightweight and handy to carry around with you. Two of us can share one wipe. Thanks!	&&&
It was just few months back I came across this wonderful brand, Seventh generation. I saw the Seventh Generation Disinfecting Wipes for the first time, at my friend's place and I found the packaging itself so fascinating. The wipes come in this cylindrical green colored box, that is so soothing to eyes. I was already in love with the product and also, he told me many good things about it. So, I had to make a purchase and I am glad I did. These wipes are good to be used on any non porous, hard surfaces like glass, ceramic, tiles, plastic and so on. It comes with easy instructions to follow. To clean the surface, wet it with a wipe and wipe clean. For tough stains, let stand for a few minutes and to disinfect, leave the surface wet for 10 minutes and let air dry. Now, comes the best part, no rinsing or wiping is required, even on food contacting surfaces. I use these wipes mostly on my workstation in the kitchen, the area which comes in contact with food the most often. Having cleaned the surface with these wipes gives me a satisfaction of being germs free, since they kill over 99.9% of household germs.	&&&
After using Lysol and Clorox disinfecting wipes for a while, I saw this at the supermarket and decided to give it a shot. How bad could it be? The same question haunts me today. It can be bad. Very bad. I began to use this product on my countertops, which I highly recommend you do not do, because it does absolutely nothing to the dirt and the grime on the surface. Instead, it smells horribly like chemicals and leaves a icky residue that I was repulsed to touch and clean up with paper towels. I'm not really sure why this product is full of chemicals because it does not clean at all, and leaves all of the dirt literally intact, while giving the grime a shine. I used an entire package of this trying to clean up some dirt on top of an old bookcase, and finally gave up, resorting to just one Clorox wipe to clean all of the dirt off and not leave a horrible smell behind. Please don't use this product, especially if you have small children- not sure what it accomplishes and it leaves a bad smell.	&&&
Nice and soft and gets the job done! Can't complain!	&&&
They wipe, they work, good deal! Better than some other brands. We like Huggies over Pampers. And we use lots at our house.	&&&
This products makes cleaning up after my 2 year old easy! Love these wipes!	&&&
i use these wipes on a daily basis to clean my house. I woud reccomend them to a anyone who has kids	&&&
The wipes are normal and scent free. They are not hard like other wipes in market, however the price is above average.	&&&
I have been using these wipes for years and they work really good. I would recommend it to anyone!	&&&
Clorox spray takes stains off the counter when i am canning. I also clean remote controls with the wipes. works great!	&&&
I have always preferred Huggies over other brands. I have tried others such as Pampers, Kirkland, etc. to maybe switch but always come back to Huggies. Overall I think they hold up well for diaper changes. The smell is fine and doesn't bother me at all. I have never had issues with rashes or irritation because of the wipes. They are great for on the go in the purse for quick clean-up and good for other uses like when you go camping. My only complaint on the big bulk boxes is that they all come with the plastic box for the wipes and if you order regularly like I have in the last 5 years you don't need all those. Would be nice if they had a box that didn't include that.	&&&
They clean so much better than the Lysol wipes. LOVE the lemon smell too. :)	&&&
I enjoy using Clorox wipes in a pinch when time is short!	&&&
My dog is trained to use an indoor potty and I love the convenience of Clorox wipes to clean up after him.	&&&
Clorox wipes are a great product and must in my house!	&&&
I love using clorox wipes because they are convenient and great at cleaning.	&&&
"My one cat is a bushy little creature and tends to always have something- usually rather unpleasant- in his fur.

These are great wipes that help keep him clean and not stinky. I use them on his butt, tail, stomach and face when he needs it, which seems to be everyday! I love that they are unscented, hypoallergenic and they don't bother my cat at all. I like that they are in a plastic container as it makes them super easy to store.

Most importantly- they help immensely in my quest to not smell like a crazy cat lady!"	&&&
I have used other brands including "generic" wipes. It's amazing how the Clorox wipes quickly pick up dirt/food on stove tops and counters in one swipe versus several swipes with other brands. Definitely worth the money!	&&&
The best disinfecting wipes I've used.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because they are so convenient cleaning up after my kids. I know that the wipes keep away the germs and clean up messes wonderfully!	&&&
these wipes are so thick and soft. i love the smell they are my favorite smelling wipes. my only complaint it that they don't come in the big box in my town.	&&&
These are awesome wipes for the times when diaper rash flares up. Regular wipes burn and sting but these are just water with the convenience of disposable wipes. Also, a friend had preemie twins and was told to only use water. She didn't know about these and was so glad to find out she could still use wipes	&&&
I depend on Clorox wipes for kitchen and bathroom easy cleanups.	&&&

The Lemon scented disinfecting wipes not only clean but leave the area smelling clean for a long time. I love knowing that my bathroom is Clorox clean but I love the long lasting smell even more.	&&&
I like the ease of use with the Clorox wipes. They do a great job for me. Like having them around.	&&&
Love the wipes especially because they are so easy to use	&&&

I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, especially the lemon scented variety. They not only clean incredibly but also add a fresh scent to my house.	&&&
Love how easy to use Clorox wipes are, and that they disinfect at the same time!	&&&

I have bought boogie wipes for my baby since she was born. They are so amazing that I even use them for me throughout the winter, these are better than Kleenex!	&&&
I love the quality of these unscented Boogie Wipes.	&&&
I have used these with both of my children. My youngest is now 6 and not a cold or allergy season goes by with out there being one in the car and house at all times. We can not live without these wonderful little wipes. With every baby shower gift, I always include a multi pack.	&&&
This is product is amazing. I use it all the time for my kids. Everytime they have a cold or their nose is running. It's soft for them as well the smell it has it's great. My kids love it and no more tough or rough tissue. Or tissue that disolves when you wipe. I always recommended to all mothers and friends.	&&&
I have been buying boogie wipes since my first son was born 5 years ago. I always keep them in stock because my kids both have very bad seasonal allergies so these really make cleaning their nose so easy. The saline that these wipes have make cleaning even dried boogies a breeze, so I do not have to fight my kids to clean their nose. The smell is also a plus. Their packing is small and compact to I always store some in backpacks, my kids cubbie at day care, in the car...	&&&
Great wipes for cold and flu season. The kids love the scent. Also, they don't irritate the kids noses like regular tissues.	&&&
Clorox wipes are so convenient and help keep my house clean.	&&&
"Lysol wipes are so needed in every house hold, office, and classroom. Whether you have kids or not.I have a bottle in my bathroom, kitchen, living room, office and my car. At home I have a 3 year old boy and he is messy, especially when he uses the bathroom. I'm constantly using my Lysol wipes in the bathroom, whether it cleaning the toilet, wiping the floors or the sink. I also use my Lysol wipes to wipe my kitchen counter and stove. if my son spills juice on the floor I use lysol wipes to clean it up. it is amazing!"	&&&
I like the convenience of using Clorox wipes. I use them in every room of the house.	&&&
Love how great these wipes are in the bathroom and on my stove top! The ease and effectiveness is amazing!	&&&
Having kids around the house is a job but these wipes makes it easier to handle. Can't image not having them, even the kids can use them as well.	&&&
I love the ease of use and the effectiveness of cleaning & disinfecting of Clorox Wipes.	&&&
Well.. It takes off makeup alright. I feel like they're not moistened enough though. I'm the type of person that likes enough wetness in my wipes so I don't feel like I'm rubbing my face on carpet. Good thing is it causes NO IRRITATION at all taking in mind my undereyes are extremely sensitive.	&&&
These wipes are large, sturdy, and very gentle on my twins' skin. Using other brands is just frustrating after using pampers sensitive wipes	&&&
I love these Handi Wipes. I'm tired of unsanitary dish clothes, and these wipes, while they are inexpensive enough to be disposable, they are also sturdy enough to go through the washer a few times. They have a million and one uses.	&&&
love the product can be confident that what ever I use the wipes on is going to be clean	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are used almost daily in my home. Very effective against germs.	&&&
Love that the wipes are so versatile and that I can use them everywhere and anywhere. One wipe also cleans so much! And after I'm done, I just throw it away.	&&&
Easy to use & your finger doesn't get caught in the hole to rip out the wipes. Once you use it, you toss it away.	&&&
As a mom with three little boys, there is always something to clean up! A messy counter top, a spilled plate... Clorox wipes are a quick solution to wipe up a surface so I have more time to spend playing with my cuties! The lemon smell is a bonus; I've used other wipes that leave a lasting unpleasant smell in my kitchen... but not Clorox!	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes they are convenient to use and disinfect everything. My kids can use them too they are so easy!	&&&
Clorox Wipes are perfect for on the go clean ups and are so convenient that I keep them in the kitchen, bathrooms, and even in my car.	&&&
clorox wipes saves time and money cleaning up all the messes and spills you will have to clean up.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They clean everything and smell so good.	&&&
I love these wipes for cleaning my counters and my babies toys.	&&&
These wipes are great for cleaning..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."}},	&&&
I love how easy the wipes clean!! They are easy to use and very convenient. Keep up the good work!!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because they are easy to use and smell great, and I can take them with me anywhere I go.	&&&
Love clorox disinfecting wipes always my go to with 2 boys. Keep them under each sink in the house. Easy to wipe accidents on the toilet rims and easily clean light switches, door knob, and most touched walls when it cold and flu season.	&&&
My family always uses Clorox wipes when cleaning because they are so easy to use.	&&&
"Clorox disinfecting wipes makes cleaning FAST, FAST, FAST!
Even my father-in-law helps out with the cleaning of the bathroom due to the convenience of these wipes."	&&&
I can trust that these wipes disinfect and leave a clean scent.	&&&
Clorox is a great trusted brand I know I can depend on! I know my house will be clean and help protect from children from germs when I use the disinfecting wipes!	&&&
"These are my first cloth wipes purchase and they are only okay. Some started falling apart (with tears at the surged edges) after only a couple washes. As several reviewers have mentioned, they repel water. To some this may not be a big deal, but it's a big deal to me, as I want to actually use them as WET wipes, not dry cloths. They have been washed about 15 times so far and are still repelling water.
I'm glad I only purchased one pack.
Side note: We purchased some cotton flannel from Walmart and JoAnn Fabrics and those materials were able to absorb water right away. We sloppily cut them up, sewed the edges, and made bunch of wipes for a fraction of the cost. Wish I had done that to begin with. Our homemade wipes may not be the prettiest, but neither are these Bumkins ones after a few washes! Either way, they are used for wiping bottoms, so aesthetics are the least of my concerns. I just want wipes that do the job, and do it well!"	&&&
I recently bought the Clorox wipes for the first time and I LOVE them! They are easy to use and have a wonderful scent. Perfect for quick, effortless clean up! You have a new customer and fan!!	&&&
This is one of my favorite products when it comes to self tanning. Usually these wipes only come in packs of 10 but this box has not 10 but 20 wipes! They are easy to open and easy to read instructions. When you open them, there isn't a bad smell to them and they wipe easily so you can get a nice even tan when you want it and where you want it. Not to mention they leave you looking beautiful! One wipe covers a large percentage of your skin. I have enjoyed using them especially in the winter when you want a nice glow to your skin instead of the boring, dull, pasty colored skin. These are perfect for all skin types and will make your skin beautiful! I highly recommend these for any and all people!	&&&
My choice of wipes for my baby ! simply excellent for her little sensitive skin. love love love these wipes...	&&&
With the flu going around as much as it has been in the past few weeks, between office, car, home and lots of places in between I have used many of these wipes. They are better than just spraying even though we do that too. I know we have several people in our office with flu and flu like systems and these wipes have went to good use on the phones and door handles. I am sure they have helped keep the spreading of the germs to a minimum. I checked the price with Wal-Mart, K-Mart and local grocery and Staples was by far the cheapest."}},	&&&
I love the convenience of keeping a canister of wipes under the bathroom sink for quick wipe downs.	&&&
We love these wipes in our home so convenient to wipe up everyday messes!!	&&&
I love the convenience of clorox wipes. They are great for quick clean-up in the bathroom or kitchen.	&&&
We use natural clean wipes when we don't have sensitive wipes. We really like it. We never had any problem with it.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best. They grab dirt better than other brands. They smell better than other brands. They don't irritate my skin like other brands.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes they are awesome to use in the entire home	&&&
I love the clorox lemon wipes! They are my go to wipe for all my messes.	&&&
"We love Pampers, currently using them on our second child, and used them all through our first as well.
BUT.... my problem lies with Amazon and not Pampers for this review. I gave this 3 stars (for Amazons part in it).
While I received the wipes on time, they are not what was listed. The picture of the wipes I ordered specifically said it was the 'pop top' lid, which is what we wanted. But when the wipes came they were not 'pop top' as listed, but just a sticker seal. I find the stickers don't stay closed very well and the top wipe tends to dry out faster.
We will not be returning them as we need the wipes but this listing needs to be updated if the product offered is not the one shown in the photo. People with babies don't tend to have the leisurely time to return and wait for new wipes. Babies poop and pee multiple times daily."	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best at removing grease off counter tops. Quick and easy clean up.	&&&
They are just great!! Easy to use. Go everywhere. Plastice tub is reusable. Wipes smell great.	&&&
Clorox wipes smell good and are a great disinfectant	&&&
the wipes are easy to use and very convenient for my family	&&&
I have four dogs and these wipes are a lifesaver to my daily cleaning routine. I use them daily for simple cleaning and also for tough jobs such as the bathroom and kitchen. I love the smell!	&&&
I love these wipes because they are so convenient and make it easy for me to clean up quickly at any time.	&&&
I relied heavily on these while training a small child to absorb her chores in the house. The wipes made it very easy to go behind without insulting her work while making sure the surfaces were clean and disinfected - extremely important when a person in the household is undergoing chemotherapy and their immune system is compromised. My only complaint has been that I wish the sheets were thicker and easier to extract from the carton - not only did my young daughter get her finger severely pinched while trying to get them out - Mom did as well and it HURT. Otherwise, quite useful - Thank You!	&&&
Love our Clorox wipes!!! From the classroom to the kitchen, Clorox wipes are hands down our favorite.	&&&
Mother of three (four if count hubby), full-time employee, clean (other people's) houses on the side, and try desperately to balance everything! I carry a package of Clorox wipes with me just about everywhere I go; that way, amid all the chaos I can have a little peace of mind knowing that at least what is in arms reach is clean!!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes, with 3 small children and being a busy mom it's convienent and less hassle, I can grab one wipe up the mess and go, it cleans and deodorizes and helps kills germs, especially when the weather is bad.	&&&
I keep Clorox wipes in everyone of my bathrooms and it's so easy for my kids to use.	&&&
Love this product for my daughter. Always moist, fresh and does a great job. I recommend over other wipes, and we've tried many.	&&&
Great for my little girl's sensitive skin. Also, they're super soft and feel good to my hands too.	&&&
They dissolve nasty boogers very well. Makes it easy to clean up snotty faces. They're a must have during cold season because regular tissues and baby wipes just don't cut it!	&&&
I love these for when the grandkids are around. Little ones forget to wash hands after rubbing a runny nose or "digging for gold" and germs spread quickly but with Boogie Wipes, no worries!	&&&
Not bad. They do clean my glasses but sometimes leaves smears or smudges behind. They are just enough for one pair of eyeglasses, but dry very quickly.	&&&
Love Huggies natural care wipes!	&&&
"Boogie wipes are my life saver with my little ones every where we go there's snot or boogers to worry about and sometimes they are hard to wipe but with my handy boogie wipes it's no problem
Just wipe and be happy and."	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. They are just as strong as any of the Huggies brand wipes, which I have come to expect, but they also smell awesome! I love how long the scent lasts but isn't overpowering and doesn't affect my baby boy's sensitive skin.	&&&
My granddaughter is just to cute. Allergies are messy coupled with not feeling well. Boogie Wipes to the rescue.	&&&
Wipes are good. I like the size and texture. They work well for my daughter.	&&&
My oldest son had a really bad running nose, his nose was red and raw. Then I tried boogie wipes and it went away!!	&&&
baby likes them i like them enough said	&&&
I got the wipes as a gift when my daughter was first born, I really didn't pay them any mind because I got tons of the "other" wipes. Well when my daughter was a year and a half old I came across my package of Fresh scent boogie wipes. I used them on her. Supra singly year and a half later they were still fresh, moist and she loved them! She did not squirm or wiggle! I went and bought some more and I use them for myself as well as her! Everyone gets boogers. It leaves no residue, has a great simple smell, stays moist, and doesn't irritate my child's sensitive nose.	&&&
Soft and don't dry out our little man's nose like ordinary wipes. Also they are thin but are super strong.	&&&
"I thought this was all a gimmick, as in really a baby needs some warm wipes. OHHH whats the baby going to do cry a little bit. But seriously... I want you to go to the bathroom right now.... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GOOOOOO!!!!..... Grab some cold water and splash it all over your butt... How's that feel. WAKEY WAKEY...

Now imagine you are a baby and have no way of communicating anything to anyone. And your butt is all cold. NO ONE LIKES THAT!!

So for the sake of your baby, warm up their wipes....... AND when you get older you too could have warm wipes for your butt... ITS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT....Trust me it'll be 'a thing' soon.!"	&&&
Not unscented but they get the job done."}},	&&&
Cleans well and more gentle on my little one. Gentle scent.	&&&
they are great for my baby and my hard to please husband prefers these to all other wipes! He is very particular with smell. Soft and great for my little ones bottom!	&&&
I love that these wipes are free from chemicals. They actually clean up any mess and save my son from diaper rash.	&&&
They clean practically anything. We're never without at least a couple handy."}},	&&&
I feel like I'm rubbing dirt and germs into my hands when I use sanitizers. These pads make me feel like I'm clean and germ-free. I work in a hospital and am surrounded by germs all the time so I am very attentive to hand cleanliness and these are a nice portable product.	&&&
This product was very gentle on our baby's skin. It cleaned the area well.	&&&
I don't think we ever just used one of these to clean baby. Maybe we have a very messy baby, or one that pees a lot more than the average, but one wasn't ever enough. They are good wipes, but you will need more than one.	&&&
Boogie Wipes are a staple in our house! We have two small children and when they start getting a yucky nose, we pull out the Boogie Wipes. I love that they are soft and moist for a our children's little noses. When I use the Boogie Wipes, they usually don't run away from me when I wipe their nose. The grape scent is our favorite! We keep one in the car, in the diaper bag and at home.	&&&
I love boogie wipes. Not only do I use it for my kids, but myself. This irritates less on our nose than regular puff tissues. My 3 yr old son prefers these when he has to blow his nose.	&&&
I love these wipes! I'm a mom of 3. I have problems with eczema and it flared up when I changed diapers until I switched. I noticed my hands don't dry out when I use this brand and it doesn't irritate my hands when the flare up has already occurred. These are as strong as the Huggies One & Done. Gentler than the sensitive pampers wipes. Pricing is the same as shopping direct with the company however you'll save on shipping with Nordstrom and you don't have to worry about being automatically signed up for shipments.	&&&
I feel like I am missing something. I have been using the liquid form of this makeup remover for two years now and I swear by it. I decided to buy the wipes because I travel a lot, but the result is completely different. It just doesn't take my eye makeup off! When it comes to foundation, eyeshadow and blush, it does the trick but when it comes to mascara and eye liners, all it does is smear it around leaving me with raccoon eyes. I have tried to get these wipes to work for me, but no matter how much I wipe (which can't be good for the sensitive skin under eyes) I am left with black smudges. I will keep these on hand for my "light" makeup days when all I am wearing is concealer, but there are other products that have worked better for me.	&&&
After 3 years as a subscribe and save regular purchaser, I am so sorry that both the size and the ingredients for these wipes has changes. Very disappointed--they've lost a loyal customer by offering a far inferior product. The new wipes are much smaller and less effective than the old ones. I paid a premium for a quality product for many years, and I sorry that they no longer offer the same fine product.	&&&
"I love Boogie WIpes!! I always like to have them on hand around cold season. It dries up runny noses and easy on the skin. I always like to add a pack or two along with baby shower gifts for new mothers! They are great!"	&&&
I received seventh generation wipes as a free trial from the company and I must say these are amazing wipes! I was skeptical I wouldn't like them, because most green products have not so pleasant scents. Well they proved me wrong these wipes are unscented, gentle and perfect of sensitive skin! If your baby has a sensitive toosh these wipes are definitely for you or if you just want to get away from all the chemicals other companies use. Our babies deserve the best so why not start by caring for their skin with seventh generation's chemical free products. Try it you'll love it!	&&&
I recently started using this wipes and I love them. They are other natural wipes in the market but these are acutually very good for the price. I am not using their diapers or any other babyganics products I hope they change some of their ingredients but as for the wipes I feel pretty safe using them on all my three kids including my newborn baby.	&&&
I have Clorox wipes and I am not afraid to use them!	&&&
I always have a box of Clorox wipes in my car and in my home. They are easy to use, and can clean up just about everything. I highly recommend this product for someone looking for an easy way to clean.	&&&
I LOVE Clorox wipes! I have a 6 month old and it is nice to have product that is simple to whip out and clean up the counters before making bottles and making baby food! I know that the counters are disinfected and no crazy after smells!	&&&
I ordered the Sani-Hands II Sanitizing Wipes with moisturizing aloe and Vitamin E in an attempt to find a hand sanitizer that truly did not damage your hands. These wipes are both disinfecting and moisturizing!. I have tried many brands that claim they moisturize and my hands end up cracked and flakey. I'm a little OCD and use the wipes quite often and these have provided me peace of mind while not damaging my skin. I plan on ordering several more canisters for both work and my home. I love them!!!"}},	&&&
Just moved out of a rental and Clorox wipes were a life saver. Very quick and easy. Thank you.	&&&
Wipes are very handy and take a minute to swipe to keep things clean	&&&
I bought these wipes to use for my two year old son and 3 month old daughter because the Pampers Sensitive Wipes were out of stock at Sam's. I got home and went to open up the wipes to get out the little clutch and fill it with wipes, and as soon as I opened the wipes they stunk so bad! I didn't even want to use them! When I did use them they were NOT thick enough and even ripped, and that's pretty frustrating when your in the middle of cleaning up a poo disaster !	&&&
Love this product. I'm a teacher and I clean my classroom surfaces with the Clorox Wipes. Love the lemon.	&&&
"These wipes are great for cleaning..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."	&&&
Natural Care wipes are my favorite wipes. Even though we are out of diapers we still keep them on hand!	&&&
"I LOVE Clorox Wipes! They make cleaning up after my 2 little ones quick and easy. I love that they disinfect to keep our home clean and germ free.
I have tried other wipes and they left a residue on the surfaces, so it never felt CLEAN. Clorox Wipes don't leave a residue. THANK YOU CLOROX!"	&&&
I like the ease of using the wipes for a quick clean and knowing that the area is being disinfected at the same time.	&&&
I love these wipes because it makes it so much easier and quicker to clean things. I also love that they disinfect too.	&&&
I tried the other wipes, they don't even come close to Clorox wipes! Clorox brand allows me to disinfect for my family with confidence	&&&
I like to keep the wipes at work. They are convenient and easy to use to wipe off my desk and chair. I use to disinfect tables that are used for training purposes. And they are a great value !!	&&&
the wipes are great they kill germs and are useful on a daily basis	&&&
great products! love there wipes and spray..a must have with small children!	&&&
Really like these wipes, I keep a canister under every sink in my house.	&&&
"Use the wipes to wipe toys especially the ones that go in my LO's mouth. Nice to have wipes that clean more that a diaper wipe. The fact that it is a wipe and not having to spray and wipe is great! Perfect to go anywhere."	&&&
An easy mistake to make as a mom is using normal wet wipes on a toddlers nose... It burns! So please use boogie wipes instead! And they smell good too!	&&&
Best wipes I have found..	&&&
I purchased Boogie Wipes 3 weeks ago and have LOVED them! I love how you can use them to clean your hands, wipe your nose, etc. They are a MUST have in my bag at all times! You can't go wrong with these!	&&&
Best wipes! I love how soft they are and they really have a high absorption rate!	&&&
great value, great baby wipes, we are very happy with them. they are strong, durable and do the job.	&&&
I love Boogie Wipes.There easy to use and gentle on little kids noses.	&&&
They are wipes. Not much else to say.	&&&
I have used Earths Best diapers and wipes since my first son was born 5 years ago. Recently, they changed the wipes they sell and the new design is awful. The old wipes were long, moist, and were easy on my sons' skin (both whose have sensitive skin). As soon as we received the new wipe, we noticed that the wipes are a lot smaller, drier, and gave our younger son a rash for the first time and he is obviously bothered when we use these new wipes on him. I just cancelled my subscribe and save for these wipes and will look for the old ones. If the old wipes are not available, I'll be looking for new wipes soon. I think Earths Best move here was a complete fail.	&&&
I bought these a week ago a having grandson , 3+ 5 years old have been very challenging for Grandmothers , but not for this Grandma , We have the Boogie Wipes unscented packed and ready to go in my handbag , has there never ever been a time that I have not use them , and easy to wipe and get the nose clean , not too mention another person asking me what are you using the kids don't even cry when you wipe their noses , I said here I'll give you this pack and try them , then get the word out how good the boogie wipes can be for all ages . She was happy took the boogie wipes and tired one and said off to Target to buy a supply of boogiewipes for my handbag and auto .	&&&
Wonderful wipes, smell great, easy to use, for sensitive skin, great for the whole family. I love these wipes	&&&
The Insignia monitor wipes are just as good if not better than name brand monitor wipes.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes Lemon scent because I like the fresh scent of lemons in my kitchen. I feel my counters are disinfected as well as clean to the eye.	&&&
I love these wipes. It makes it easy for my boys to help keep their bathroom clean	&&&
I love using Clorox disinfectant wipes when I wipe my kitchen counters. These are perfect to use.	&&&
Clorox wipes have earned a permanent place in the boys bathroom! These have allowed me to train my boys so that when they miss the toilet- they can redeem themselves by quickly wiping it up before mommy can smell the bathroom- or better yet, before mom sits on their surprise! Clorox wipes have also given them a sense of accomplishment because they get to clean their sink and as a mom, I can monitor how much they're using rather than half a spray bottle of cleaner being used to wipe a dab of toothpaste off the edge of the sink! Overall- great product for a quick little spruce-up!	&&&
amazon offers this lysol wipes value pack at such a great deal, I can't even believe it myself. when I opened the container for use, the wipes came out nice and saturated. sometimes with this kind of price tag you may wonder whether or not the wipes are dry, old, etc. NOT HERE!! I totally recommend this purchase. I am very pleased with mine. will do business again!! thanks amazon!! stay awesome!! and, to my fellow consumers out there, I say with utter confidence... purchase with no regrets and enjoy!! work it. own it. love it. xoxo.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because they are so easy to use and kill germs!!	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are my go-to for quick cleaning jobs for my family of 6. We are messy but cleaning up is easy! I	&&&
Clorox wipes are a great product for great value. My only complaint would be that they are not as durable as a rag. Definitely continue to buy for the convenience!	&&&
These wipes are great for the kids to use to clean. I keep some in the bathroom for them to wipe down the counter.	&&&
Love these wipes...this time of year I have a cannister in every room in the house to help wipe down things and stop germs.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes! With two messy kids around, these come in very handy.	&&&
When I need the Clorox Wipes, they get the job done well.	&&&
Clorox wipes makes it so easy to clean. I use them everywhere.	&&&
"I was so excited to try these out when I came. I used to pay to go to a tanning bed but that can be rather costly and you have to continue to go over and over if you don't want to lose your tan. Also, it is dangerous for your body. I wanted to find something simpler. I have used the tanning lotions that you can buy at the stores and the smell was just so awful that my husband didn't want to be in bed with me anymore.

When these came, I wanted to use them right away. You aren't supposed to shave at least 24 hours before using this. I was too excited to read the instructions and shaved right away so I had to wait. The next day, I tried them out. I decided to just do one leg so that I would have a before and after and I figured my legs were safe since they are hidden because of winter.

These tan towels come in individual packages so you could take them with you on the go if you wanted. They look like baby wipes to me. They are just white. To my surprise, there was no smell at all. I didn't have a glove so I just grabbed it with a paper towel and held it that way and wiped it all over my leg. Because it is clear, I couldn't tell if I was getting some areas more than once so I was afraid of streaking. It quickly dries, but the box says to not get dressed for 10 minutes. I didn't want to stain my clothes so I followed the directions.

The next day, I didn't really notice a difference. I do have a medium skin tone already so I figured I'd give it another whirl. I did the same leg and followed the same process as before. The next morning when I was getting dressed, I noticed that my leg looked like I had gotten a slight tan. I am so happy with these. That was only with using 2 wipes. I can't believe how great these things really work. I did smell a tiny hint of that fake tan smell on my leg, but it really wasn't noticeable when I had clothes on. I will be using these from now on instead of the tanning bed because it is so much easier and so much more affordable!"	&&&
I am a fan of costco, and especially their baby wipes. We all know that adults use babywipes just as much as babies. So I was very disappointed when the latest version I got smelled so bad that I got sick to my stomach. I am not exaggerating-there is something wrong with these wipes. I hope that Kirkland goes back to their original formula. Don't mess with a good thing.	&&&
These are the best wipes out there, they are both gentle and strong, they don't fall apart in your hand, they don't slip out of your hand, my kids don't get a rash from them the way they do from others like pampers wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for cleaning up messes and disinfecting surfaces.	&&&
I love love love Clorox disinfecting wipes! I have 3 kids, 2 dogs,2 cats and a guinea pig and let's not forget my darling husband. they are always handy to have. I keep them in my car, kitchen, and bathroom. Especially great when potty training to wipe out their little potties when cleaning up! So easy to use and so convenient!	&&&
"The wipes I purchased were almost bone dry. I have to use two or three to clean anything. And the wipes do not dispense properly."	&&&
clorox is one of the only cleaners that I buy, the rest are homemade! The wipes are always nice and wet and they're so convenient.	&&&
I uses the wipes for everything from door knobs to cleaning my car. they are very handy around the house. A must have.	&&&
I am a big fan of the Clorox wipes,they are effective cleaners,easy to use and they smell great.	&&&
If you are a new parent, you are probably overwhelmed by all of the options when it comes to diapers and wipes as well as every other baby product out there. As a mom of 3, I have tried just about every one I have come across, and I am absolutely sold on Huggies for wipes. (Diapers I would say Pampers are the best, but this review is for wipes :) ) The wipes themselves are soft and durable and get the job done. Pampers wipes seem a little slippery to me, which is fine for wet diapers, but for those dirty diapers, Huggies have a little more "grab" to them. Also, if you take a huggies wipe, you can easily tear it in half, which is more than enough for a wet diaper on a newborn. Huggies wipes are the only ones that easily tear right down the middle. This means it's like you are getting twice the wipes for your money. I have gotten to where I can actually just pull them halfway out of the wipes container and tear half with one hand. As you get spending and see how many wipes you go through, this will make a huge difference!	&&&
I absolutely love these tanning wipes! They add such a beautiful natural glow after just one use. The wipes do not smell like anything which is great for those who are sensitive to scents but I would like the option to chose a scent when purchasing. The wipes are too small for my liking as I prefer and all over tan and needed 3 wipes for one use to get an all over tan. I think having the option to chose between larger wipes and these smaller wipes would also be great. They went on great there was no mess no oily feel and no streaking! My skin dried super fast! I was really impressed with these wipes and love having a nice glow in the cold winter months. They are also so convenient to take with you as the packets are little enough to fit in your pocket or purse. I would defiantly recommend.	&&&
These are the only wipes I use for quick and easy clean up in the kitchen!	&&&
Great wipes, keeps baby bum fresh.	&&&
These wipes stay moist better than other wipes I have tried. Clean well and are very gentle.	&&&
I'm extremely happy I got the .chance to try these self tanning wipes for quality testing purposes. I normally use the St. Tropez bronzing mousse and I can say that the color these gave me was right up there with that well known brand. The wipes are half body size (most tanning wipes come like this) which is great so the wipe doesn't dry out in the middle of applying. Also if I just wanna touch up my legs or face I'm not wasting product. I applied one wipe and after 4 hours I had a slight tan and glow but because I prefer a darker tan I applied a second application. When I woke up in the morning I was very pleased to see my tan was darker. It was also not streaky and very even. Best of all I was not orange at all. I do wish the initial application was darker but all skin is different. I also love the cut-out in the box where I can pull one wipe at a time. I will be buying more of these and recommending them to everyone I know. I'm so glad to have found these because I can now get my "high end brand" tan at way less then half the cost!	&&&
We use wipes every day All the time. My kids look so confused if they run out???? Mom what do we wipe the table off with??? like what did we use before wipes were invented??? :) I love clorox.	&&&
I use a lot of Clorox products but at this time of the year I use a lot of the wipes to clean all kind of surfaces to prevent the spread of germs!	&&&
Bought my original box of Germ-X antibacterial wipes from Sam's Club, we ran out but didn't want to have to drive all the way to it, so I ordered them online at Wal-Mart. You wouldn't believe what these wipes can clean!!! We started using them, carrying them in my purse, on cleaning our hands, wiping off the buggies at stores when we shop. One day I found a long pen ink stain on the roof of our brand new car, so I reached into my purse and started wiping, thinking there's no way this antibacterial soft wipe is going to be able to get this ink out. Just as I started wiping, the ink stain was coming off. I was amazed. I saw that the wipe was leaving a wet stain, and I figured that it would leave a stain from the wetness, but within minutes the ink stain was gone and the wet stain was gone, leaving no stain anywhere. We started using it on my granddaughter's clothes and car seat, my husband's shorts, if he dropped BBQ sauce on them, around the house, on white tennis shoes, you name it, it will come off!!! We Love these wipes, I keep them in my purse, in the car, in the diaper bag...you name it, we've got there!!! Please don't ever stop making these	&&&
clorox wipes are convenient when your traveling to help ensure that you have a clean bathroom break while on the road.	&&&
Love the wipes! So easy to use and they smell so clean.	&&&
This wipe warmer looks fancier than others so I thought it would be better but that's not the case. We have 2 wipe warmers, this one and the munchkin one (one for our room for nighttime an one for babies room) the lionheart warmer seems to dry the wipes out more than the other even though it does have a pad that you wet and place under the wipes. The warmer also tears the wipes when pulling them out quite a bit. It also doesn't have any sort of window to see when your wipes are almost empty so you have to open to check once in a while or you find yourself without warm wipes in the night time. If I had to go back and choose to buy or not to buy, I would have to pass on this one. It does look nicer than the others though if looks is all you care about.	&&&
Use the Clorox wipes for everything in my house. With 2 little ones running around, these come in handy.	&&&
I love these wipes! Much more efficient then a regular towel. I have a 19 month old, and lets say, things get a little messy... A LOT!	&&&
Love the Disinfecting Wipes..Easy to use and get for on the go	&&&
Great and convenient way to clean! I use these wipes to quickly clean my kitchen each day and love them!	&&&
I love the disinfecting wipes because they are convenient, disinfect, and are easy to use. With three young boys, the faster the better and I have trusted Clorox for many years	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes!!! They clean every stain that my family has to offer. Fantastic product. #CustomerForLife	&&&
Murphy's wipes--trusted Murphy's soap in a convenient, lint free wipe. Perfect for dusting and cleaning wood. I alternate between Murphy's wipes and polish. Excellent!	&&&
I love Clorox toilet cleaner and wipes. Work well and easy	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They clean and disinfect all in one cleaner. you dont need a lot of other cleaners. Clorox cleaners does it all.	&&&
Boogie wipes are a necessecity! I'm so thankful we were told about then. They're a little pricey but well worth it in by opinion. They do a great job of getting dried boogies off my daughter's face, and they don't leave her skin irritated like a tissue. We even use these to clean her up after meals because they work so much better than regular wipes or even a wash cloth, especially for foods that dry on her skin quickly, like beans and mac and cheese.	&&&
Very nice hand and face wipes. Great for all sorts of occasions.	&&&
Clorox wipes have it all. They are great for disinfecting of course but also they smell great!	&&&
Use the wipes to wipe toys especially the ones that go in my LO's mouth. Nice to have wipes that clean more that a diaper wipe. The fact that it is a wipe and not having to spray and wipe is great! Perfect to go anywhere.	&&&
During the cold and flu season I use the wipes around my house for the kids so we don't pass our germs around to each other. Works great!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes because I can wipe my bathroom down every morning when I get out of the shower. I always have a clean bathroom when company stops by and it always smells nice and clean.	&&&
"Having had two babies who can create some messy diapers, these wipes were a must buy! It wipes up messes with ease. The fragrance free aspect of these wipes are definitely a plus because other wipes with fragrance can be overpowering. The prepackaged wipes are definitely hand for diaper bags/purses since they can be smushed slightly.

My only problem with these is how the wipes come out of the container. The cerated cuts don't easily allow me to grab one wipe at a time. It typically grabs two or three when I only need one. I then have to tear off the excess wipe and stuff it back into the container. It's just a nuisance."	&&&
Love clorox wipes. cleans and disinfects everything and leaves a fresh clean smell	&&&
"I think clorax wipes take the hardwork out of cleaning.
The ""liquid"" is already in the ""towel"" & no need to get a seperate paper towel or liquid spray.
It takes away the germs, viruses, bacteria & all sorts of things the general eye cannot see.
They are fast, easy convenient & get the job done!
Wipes are the way to go!
It makes cleaning fun!"	&&&
I love Clorox disinfecting wipes because they get the job done and they are easy to use.	&&&
Clean smell. I feel confident that my counters are their cleanest after using these wipes.	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox disinfecting wipes! They're easy to use and even my kids will clean with them!	&&&
We use wipes for our kitchen and bathrooms. Convenient and effective. Won't use any others!	&&&
Good product, great scent and they never dry up unlike similar brands of wipes. Very soft and stretchable.	&&&
Love the wipes! Thick, but not too thick. Have a pleasant smell but jot overpowering. And cheaper than other brands, but I prefer them over ANY wipe.	&&&
These are the best wipes I've ever used. I use them on my prescription glasses, my cell phone's screen as well as my laptop's screen(although that usually takes 2). They aren't too wet and because of the low moisture level the surface you're cleaning dries almost instantly. I bought my first box 2 years ago and am ready to get my second box, however while I previously believed the price on Amazon seemed reasonable at $14 for 200, I've learned otherwise. I've found that Sam's club sells these in stores (probably not all of them) for $8.86. Even if you don't have a membership you can buy things at Sam's and just pay 10% extra so that'd be around $9.75 and still a substantial savings over the price here which I see hasn't changed a cent in 2 years.	&&&
I use wipes to clean my pups after there walk	&&&
I absolutely love pampers.. They are a great product I have used from hospital newborn to size 3 now. Wipes are great too! I'm definitely a pampers mom!!	&&&
These wipes are great! They clean well! Love that they are unscented!	&&&
As a caregiver for a stroke patient, its important to have a flushable wipe for cleanup. This brand does the job and a large supply is available at a reasonable price.	&&&
These one and done wipes really are thick. I would highly recommend trying them. Compared to walmart and pampers, these are far superior!	&&&
"These wipes make me feel more clam and relaxed. making it easier to fall asleep.It does what it says."	&&&
I used the leather conditioner on my 3 black leather couches and purposely applied it to half a section on one of the couches to see if there is a difference. You can actually see the difference! It made the couch shinier and looks renewed. The scent is pleasant as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who want to restore the luster in their leather seats.	&&&
I wish I had discovered all the many uses for these handy wipes years ago. Good product good price.Thank you.	&&&
After using the wipes a few times I thought they were doing a good job, but when I held my glasses up to a light bulb I could see smears and what looked like an overall gray film on the lenses. I've since switched to another lens cleaner that does a much better job. The Pdi wipes are going to be sold at our next garage sale.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are by far the best invention ever. I am so addicted to using these that I use them any time I can make up an excuse to clean something. I use them in the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, hallways, living room, and everywhere else. They are great to clean up sticky messes made by children and for cleaning toys that might have germs from little baby friends. They keep my germ-a-phobic mind at ease when it comes to kitchen germs like raw chicken and ground beef. They also assure me that my bathroom is sanitary after having guests using the facilities. I also use them in lieu of paper towels because hey, why not? They smell great no matter what scent you buy and you have the added peace of mind knowing that the surface you now cleaned is the cleanest part of your home. They are also great for dusting in general because they will get a fair amount of surface clean before you need to switch to a new one. You can use them on pretty much any surface also. They are awesome and every home should always have them handy.	&&&
I received a pack of clorox disinfecting wipes as a small gift from my work for my desk area. I love this product. I bought some for my house and for my sons daycare. Love it would never go back to what I was using in the past	&&&
I buy these to keep on my desk at work--germy students routinely cough on my desk. The disinfecting wipes help me to not contract dorm-ickiness.	&&&
I love the fresh smell with Clorox disinfecting wipes.	&&&
i thoroughly enjoy these wipes. I would recommend.	&&&
Absolutely love the lemon disinfecting wipes! Leaves the surface smelling great and fresh, in addition to disinfecting. Use daily, often several times a day!	&&&
"So here we're into the 5th package, we found the product itself to be amazing but the little tub was sorta flimsy. So I put a review deduct a star for a somewhat flimsy white box to store wipes in.... and I get an email from Amazon asking if they can talk with me... Sure I reply and soon I got a call from Dawn with the Amazon Elements team.

Conversation went like this... would you be willing to give us feedback on your experience with this product. (Okay so nobody EVER from Pampers, Johnson + Johnson, or any ""famous"" name contacted me before so that is a point for amazon)
She said they constantly are improving the product (Okay, that is another star for Amazon)
We spoke quite candidly about the product which is great, and absorbent, the wipes flush well, the wipes have plenty of liquid, are the best I've ever purchased, bar none... I had a small issue with the tub which was thin on top and became impossible to close. This was my one star deduct but with Amazon caring enough to call me, with Amazon caring about their product development, star has been added giving it one of my rare 5 stars.

Win win for Amazon, quadruple win for anyone who buys them... and FYI you can get a full refund if you aren't satisfied, I absolutely refused a refund, I am thoroughly elated to be contacted by a company that cares it was worth every penny for the product."	&&&
I use Clorox wipes on all surfaces to disinfect and clean, especially when someone has the flu. Also good in classroom for wiping down surfaces to help spread of germs. Good for a quick clean up in bathroom too.	&&&
My roommate is a total slob and never cleans the kitchen under any circumstances. If it wasn't for Clorox wipes, I'd likely be starved to death.	&&&
I absolutely using these wipes to clean up after my son!	&&&

I love using clorox wipes to clean my whole house especially in the bathroom. it smells so fresh and I know I'm killing germs and protecting my family.	&&&
I love to use Clorox wipes at home, at work, and in the classroom.	&&&
I use these wipes all the time around my house with 3 young children. They are easy to access and get the job done.	&&&
Love the wipes. Cut my cleaning time in half and allows me to disinfect while doing so.	&&&
With my family on a budget, we buy a lot of generic goods. One thing we do not buy generic, are these Clorox wipes. We have two very active toddlers, and they are constantly making all sorts of messes. These wipes disinfect, clean very well, and smell nice. These are the ultimate cleaning product in our busy household. No store brand wipe can compare to Clorox, which is why our locked cleaning cabinet is jam packed full of these gems.	&&&
I love having the lemon clorox wipes on hand during this cold and flu season.	&&&
Love using Clorox disinfecting wipes!Easy to use and not messy!!	&&&

These wipes do not have the strong clorax smell that you usually get with clorox bleach. My family thanks you for that.	&&&
Love these convenient wipes! Great for the whole house!	&&&
I love these wipes, it makes small clean ups during the week a breeze.	&&&
Pampers wipes are super soft on babies skin. They work extremely well for newborns when their skin is the most sensitive. The wipes are also perfectly moist and stay moist in the package. However these wipes are very thin. As my baby has gotten older I need a thicker wipe to tackle the dirty jobs. Otherwise I find myself using many wipes for one dirty diaper.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! So easy. No nasty wash clothes to launder just throw away the mess when you are done!	&&&
My favorite all time wipes. I need them in the kitchen and the bathroom.	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox disinfecting wipes. GREAT VALUE! REALLY WORKS!!!	&&&

Adriana"	&&&
I use these wipes religiously. They are really great!	&&&
Clorox disinfectant wipes are a lifesaver! As a mother of a energetic and messy toddlers, paper towels can only go so far as far as cleaning up messes. That's why I always have a canister of Clorox disinfectant wipes nearby. With the Clorox name, I know that the wipes will do the job 110%. Thanks Clorox!	&&&
I've exclusively used Huggies One and Done wipes for my son until I recently switched over to Huggies Natural Care. I was in love with the one and done wipes until I found out about the harmful effects of Paraben preservatives. I eliminated them from all shampoos, soaps, makeup, etc. in my household. Thus, there went the wipes. I'm so disappointed! These are superior to any other wipes I've used. Huggies take out the Parabens and I would rate them 5 stars!	&&&
i love these wipes. with 5 girls in the house and lots of germs, they come in handy, especially with flu season in full swing.	&&&
good product :D I have a 3 years old at home and a Clorox wipes comes very handy with my messy boy	&&&
I'm not a fan of huggies wipes. I like their diapers okay for the most part. But the wipes always seem for wet than necessary	&&&
Love the disinfecting wipes I always purchase the Lemon scent because it not only makes my home smell fresh and clean. But I know it disinfects all surfaces.	&&&
Clorox is the Best value for my buck! if your tired of boring old cleaners that DO NOT clean to your satisfaction then head on over to the Clorox section where we have Sprays, Powder,Wipes & bottled concentrate to meet ALL your cleaning needs for a fraction of the cost of those other high priced or cheap made bargain brands. Why blow money on them when you can buy the BEST from Clorox its the ONLY brand me & my family PREFER!!]	&&&
I can have a clean house, car, Girl Scout meeting, picnic, etc. with disinfecting wipes	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I have small children so it is a quick and easy way for me to clean up messes.	&&&
Love the wipes. easy and conveient to use and disinfects	&&&
"great products, prevents wipes from drying out. love it."	&&&
My children think these wipes are easier on their faces and noses and I like that.	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.I liked and is excelents wipes	&&&
We are die hard Boogie Wipes users. We really like that they don't dry out our kids' noses and are gentle while also grabbing the boogies and keeping the area clean. I highly recommend them.	&&&
I work with preschool children and Boogie Wipes are awesome! I refuse to use anything else, ever!	&&&
I received these wipes for free for review purposes from Generation Good! I was nervous trying these Wipes because I am so used to Huggies and Pampers brands. I was totally shocked when I pulled out a THICK wipe! Nothing that will tear easily - but a nice thick wipe! Upon using them, they were great. I will definitely be a buyer of this product and will most definitely recommend this product to all my Mommy friends!	&&&
I like this product but you can just use regular wipes as well for the same thing, so I'm not quite sure I would purchase it again.	&&&
"""I use these to clean pacifiers, toys, if I don't have the toy wipes they smell great.

I go through them like crazy.

Recommend recommend recommend"""	&&&
I've been a fan of boogie wipes since my first son...I now have for boys! With boys things tend to get messy quick, and boogie wipes always does the job! I never leave home without them.	&&&
I received this product to try for free, however all opinions are entirely my own. I normally use cloth wipes, so I was excited to try out a "name brand" wipe. I liked how soft they were, but also thick enough that I wasn't having to use a ton of wipes for each change. I also liked that they were wet enough to clean baby's bottom, but not so wet that they were dripping. Overall, I really like these wipes and think I will purchase them again in the future.	&&&
Pretty awesome wipes. No harsh smell, they don't break. My son has really sensitive skin and this almost like using cloth and water. Will buy again for sure.	&&&
I don't know what my son would do without his kandooo flushable wipes. He always manages to make a mess of toilet paper, and its always falling apart on him. He would not have a clean bottom without these wipes. Always have to have them on hand!	&&&
Doesn't make my baby's bum red and leaves him nice and clean. Really liked the fact that it comes with a tub for the wipes just incase you don't already have one.	&&&
It's nice that I can surprise my daughter and son-in-law every now and then with a big box of diapers and wipes for my grandson. This box of wipes lasts them quite a while!	&&&
Love the wipes for fast clean up with two small children they are a lifesaver. Bonus that it kills germs during cold and flu season we need all the help we can get.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are easy to use, smell amazing and I know I can trust its cleaning power because of the clorox name	&&&
This particular Purell wipe was a wasted purchase as over 70% of the wipes were dry. The wipe was small and was made of a stiff material. I had purchased Purell wipes in the past 8" x 6" soft cloth, very moist and great - ran out - thought these would be the same and unfortunately ordered two boxes. I'm sure some company out there still has an inventory of the "quality" Purell wipes I've experienced in the past.	&&&
This product really gets the job done. It kills the germs and gets things in the house clean. Even our schools prefer these wipes when asking for supplies.	&&&
Love Clorox disinfecting wipes - it is my go to cleaning product for kitchen messes!	&&&
I always have a bottle of the wipes in my bathrooms and kitchen. They make it easy to clean-up and wipe down counters.	&&&
I really do love clorox wipes, they are easy to use, they clea really well and one wipe goes a long way!	&&&
Clorox wipes are so handy. The kids don't care a bit to help clean with something so simple to use.	&&&
I have tried other products but we go back everytime to Clorox disinfecting wipes. It cleans most stains but without leaving sticky residue. The smell is nice too!	&&&
Definitely stronger than the rival Huggies brand wipes. AND they are soft and gentle. Compared to any other wipes, Pampers are top notch!	&&&
I love the wipes... they are so easy to just grab one and use	&&&
I use Clorox clean-up in my kitchen all the time and love the power of it. I use the wipes because of their disinfecting power. I work with kids every day and need the power of bleach and Clorox is my choice.	&&&
"We have used these Handi Wipes Heavy Duty cleaning cloths for decades, probably from the time the product was launched. Through the years, the ownership of the brand has changed a number of times, and is currently a Clorox product. I have no idea who actually manufactures this product for Clorox, as the process is quite complicated and the ""non-woven"" fabric can be made in many different variations for various products.

While admitting that these heavy duty wipes are still our product of choice for general cleaning, we are VERY disappointed that the quality of this product has gone straight downhill over the past five years or so. To say that the current product can be rinsed and reused 20 times is a total exaggeration. To say it can be squeezed 20 times might be more accurate. As you rinse and reuse it in a perfectly normal way, the fabric gets thinner, then develops holes, and eventually the cloth disintegrates into a shapeless sheet of pulp.

There are only two explanations as to why the quality of this product has fallen to this sorry state: 1). Either Clorox has purposefully redesigned the fabric to fall apart faster to encourage more sales, or 2). They have taken their eye off quality and the manufacturing process is out of control. From my early days working in this industry, I know how the product is made, and when too little ""binder"", (a type of adhesive) is used, the fibers are not sufficiently held together, and the fabric is weak and deteriorates faster. In the old days, a batch of bad fabric might slip through the Quality Control Department, but now the pendulum has swung 360 degrees, and a GOOD batch might slip through.

My wife and I continue to purchase this product, because the only real substitutes are cloth or paper, which have their own disadvantages. Hopefully, Clorox will read some of the one and two star reviews and take some action. How to sum up this review? Long time users will be disappointed by the current quality, but first time users might be satisfied because there are no other good comparable products out there. Give it a try and see for yourself."	&&&
I LOVE DISINFECTING WIPES. SOMEONE MAKES A MESS AT MY HOUSE, WHICH IS ALL THE TIME WITH A FOUR YEAR OLD, GRAB A WIPE AND CLEAN IT UP. ALSO CLEANS MY STOVE TOPS DO EASILY.	&&&
I love to use the wipes. They are easy to store and to take around on the go. When the flu hit our home, we had plenty on stand by!!	&&&
I love using the Clorox wipes for cleaning and disinfecting my countertops and stove top after cooking dinner or a large meal.	&&&
After trying all different wipe brands the past 2 years with my son, Pampers is my only choice. If I run out before I can place another order online I will not settle for any other brand to use on my son's sensitive skin. I find that other wipes are not as soft and forgiving to babies bottoms. Children have to wear diapers for a long time before they are potty trained and with so many diaper changes in one day other wipes caused my son's bottom to become chafed and dry because they were so rough. Pampers wipes are so soft and I use it to moisturize his skin after a bath instead of puting lotion that may irritate him in his diaper area.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for cleaning up a quick spills or tidying the bathroom before guests arrive. I especially like that one side has scrubbing power.	&&&
These wipes are convenient and an excellent value!	&&&
Love using Clorox wipes for everyday cleaning. Easy for wiping and disinfecting all touchable surfaces.	&&&
This is a great product and easy to use. The Lemon scented wipes smell great.	&&&
These clorox wipes are not only great to use at home, but they are great to use on the carts at the grocery stores too. That way you can use a cart from outside and disinfecting it before you even use it! Great for high chairs too!	&&&
I LOVE these wipes and use them to clean my counter tops, in both the kitchen and the bathroom. I have two boys so there's always a mess to clean up and these save time and disinfect! they rock!	&&&
I love these wipes! I use them all the time and they never disappoint.	&&&
Great Products! Love the Clorox Wipes! They smell great and clean well!	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use - handy when we are sick for easy clean up	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting wipes ,I use them every wear .	&&&
These flush able wipes are the best I've tried. They don't clog my toilet	&&&
These Green Works compostable cleaning wipes are better for the environment than the chemical-laden wipes I've used in the past, so we prefer to use these. They are more expensive, but actually go a long way. One wipe will cover your entire desk area, including computer, accessories, desktop, plus door handles, window ledges and any other areas in your office that you're hoping to clear of any grubby germs. I also like that they don't make your office smell like lemons or chemicals - they're practically odorless. I highly recommend making the switch."}},	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I use them daily to clean my desk and to clean messes at home.	&&&
I love these wipes. I use them everywhere - kitchen, bathroom, doorhandles, doorknobs, light switches, phones, etc. I believe they kill a lot of germs and help keep my family healthy	&&&
Love clorox wipes. I';m a piano teacher and its the only wipe that keep my keys clean!	&&&
My family LOVE the Clorox wipes. We use them throughout our household on a daily basis. We highly recommend!!!	&&&
My 2.5 year old son refuses dry tissues ("sore!") but will wipe and blow his nose by himself ("breathe better!") with these simple and chemical-free wipes. Highly recommend for snotty kids, especially in the wintertime. We've had no chapped skin yet this very dry season.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes in the bathrooms and kitchen. They are a easy way to quickly disinfect surfaces.	&&&

I use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes almost everday, here's nothing like it!	&&&
Clorox wipes leave whatever surface you are cleaning feeling fresh and smelling great. We use them in our bathrooms and kitchen. They are so convenient and wonderful especially this time of year.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. It's about the only way I can get my daughter to clean. She hates having to spray cleaners and then wipe them up. She says it makes her hands smell. The wipes are great and no leftover smell on her hands.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are easy and convenient to use on almost any surface. They clean and disinfect surfaces well and smell nice too!!	&&&
The other day I discovered my son drew all over the cabinets with purple sharpie. I almost lost my mind! The Clorox wipes were sitting on the counter so they are the first thing I reached for..and I'm glad I did. I couldn't believe with a little elbow grease and a wipe that the sharpie was gone. Always my go-to! I use these at least 20x a day w. a puppy and 5 small children.	&&&
"BOTTOM LINE
> For me, the one outstanding feature of ""Wet Ones"" as opposed to all other brands I've found, is that ""Wet Ones"" fit in the beverage holders of both of my cars (VWs), so that I can clean my hands everytime I get into my car (other than when leaving home). It is especially important to thoroughly clean your hands after using gasoline pumps, or handling cash---both are cesspools.

ALSO
> Since you usually touch your steering wheel before getting to the anti-bacterial wipes, remember to clean it after you've finished cleaning your hands.
> The wipes are also very helpful for cleaning bird crap or smashed insects from your windshield, cleaning your windshield wipers, etc.

CONS
> It can be hard to start a new roll.
> The lid is small, so it is hard to close without some of catching some of the wet towel, which will then wick out the moisture."	&&&
After using this product once, I'll never use anything else! Boogie Wipes clean up little and big messes and are very skin friendly!	&&&
I bought these wipes for my darling Grand daughter. She has seasonal allergies, and is quite miserable this time of year. Always stuffed up and or running uncontrollably. That is until... I found your unscented boogie wipes!! I love them !! They help her sooo much. She is breathing easier and is less fussy. Thank you BOOGIE WIPES!!	&&&
These are terrible compared to the former yellow packaged wipes by Earth's Best. These are smaller and dryer. I will not be purchasing them again.	&&&

Best product ever. Brings comfort to a runny nose. I share the boogie wipes discovery with all new moms. Its a great addition to any baby shower gift too!	&&&
Great wipes. I use them to wipes hands and faces, and they don't dry the skin	&&&
Wipes are too oily and leave residue. The wipes caused more work cleaning the residue left behind.	&&&

These wipes are the only brand we buy!	&&&
Best wipes ever	&&&
We love these! These are great for sensitive skin and don't burn like so many other baby wipes. AND, they are flushable so we aren't contributing to filling up landfills as much. The best baby and earth friendly baby wipes we have found (and we've looked through a whole bunch)!	&&&

These are gentile wipes for little bottoms. I love these for my baby.	&&&
These moist wipes worked well for cleaning the dirt from eye glasses, scopes and pc screen.	&&&

I bought this a few days ago to use while my grandkids were visiting. I love them. This is what I will use from now on. The scent was way better than diaper wipes which is what I usually use!	&&&
Mold! Arghhh. Many of my wipes have mold. I used this product for the first year of my child life. This box had moldy wipes. Very concerning. I Googled this and I guess it's a common issue. Not okay. Not safe.	&&&
Love huggies natural car baby wipes. I have these on subscription with amazon mom club. The quality is great for the price of these wipes. My baby has a clean bottom with no irritation.	&&&
These wipes are great for wiping runny noses that are sore. I prefer the unscented as sometimes the smell can irritate already sensitive noses. I do how're wish that the 90 count packages had the flip top like the smaller single packages. That is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. They are great for adult too! They also work to wipe little hands and mouths if needed!	&&&
We have been using Kandoo wipes for a few years now, they are the best quality toddler wipes we have come across. They pull out easily without falling apart (compared to store brands). They are durable wipes that wipe easily and are soft enough to use on sensitive bottoms. Convenient toddler size too!	&&&
Love these wipes for my kids' little faces! I can't use much in terms of wipes/baby wipes because my kids rash so easily. Even other hypoallergenic products still manage to rash my kids. These are great, and even better when you buy in bulk!	&&&
"I absolutely love these eye makeup remover wipes, it has double side one for exfoliating and the other for simple cleaning. I use them everyday even when I don't have any eye makeup on, it really does pick up the grime and dirt left on your face.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
Another mom gave me these as a gift when my daughter was 1. At first I thought they weren't much different from a regular baby wipe and that I wouldn't really use them much. I was wrong. From the first use, they feel different than baby wipes. The saline in them makes them more gentle for little noses that are already miserable from colds or allergies. These are now part of my Amazon subscription service. I definitely recommend keeping a package or two on hand.	&&&
I have a 3 month old and a 2 year old. I've used these wipes for every change for both kids and they've had very few rashes. In fact, the younger one has never had a rash at all! These wipes are very gentle and don't cost much more than the regular wipes. They're nice and thick but very, very soft.	&&&
I like the Clorox disinfecting wipes because they are convenient and easy to use. I also like that one side is rougher for scrubbing purposes.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes! Gives me the confidence of disinfection.	&&&

I love these wipes. I use them at home and at work. They disinfect and are easy to use.	&&&
Other brands of bleach do not whiten as much as Clorox does. Their wipes are convenient and effective. The toilet bowl cleaner is easy to use, effective and convenient as well. I love all their products.	&&&
I have 4 kids so I need to clean constantly and easily Clorox Disinfecting Wipes allows me to do that.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes to clean just about everything from daily messes to weekly cleaning. They are a great value and a disinfects. I keep them with me at work since I work at a bank, between clients that are sick and nasty money they keep my area clean from germs.	&&&
I love clorox wipes for the convenience, but most of all i love them bc they WORK!!!! My husband & I use them as quick spot clean-ups on the bathroom floor (its tile) & it makes it so fast & easy between mopping sessions.	&&&
I love how easy it is to use the wipes. You can clean and disinfect something so quickly. the scent is awesome.	&&&
Great product, the only disinfecting wipes we use.	&&&
Whenever I have a tough mess I know I can always count on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to get the job done and it leaves a fresh scent afterwards.	&&&
I keep a bottle of lemon wipes near all of the sinks in my house, as well as in the car. I use them all the time!	&&&
So happy to see Aveeno positively radiant makeup removing wipes. They are great my skin has never looked better or felt softer...... But the smell is sooooo strong it makes me sick..cross between very strong floral and bug spray... Just love the wipes please unscented or more crisp clean scent...PLEASE!"}	&&&
These wipes are wonderful yo have if you have children. I keep them in the car for easy and quick clean-ups. I would recommend them to anyone.	&&&
I think these are wonderful to use for cleaning. I am all about saving time and money, I is good to do both when using Clorox wipes.	&&&
I use Clorox Wipes on a daily bases. Excellent for kitchen and garage use. I keep a mine on the kitchen counter. Love, love, love these!	&&&
I have a canister of Clorox wipes in every room. I use them constantly.	&&&
I use these wipes at work. Lots of us share the phone and keyboard at the reception desk. I wipe everything down before I leave the area and when I am assigned to the area.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great! They are very convenient when cleaning the restrooms and kitchen. They are great at removing stains and makes it easy to wipe things down.	&&&
use these wipes on a regular basis, strongly recommend this product	&&&
Love Clorox Disinfecting wipes, I use it for everything, from cleaning the bathroom to just random touch-ups.	&&&
Pampers products have always been one of our family's favorites! I opened the box up, took out the seven packages of wipes, and stood them up around a bushel basket I am filling with products for a Baby Shower gift =)	&&&
I have terrible dry eye from ineffective oil glands and these help keep my lids clean and my eyes feeling better. This is the most gentle lid cleanser that actually works. Sterilid works, but stings the skin around my eyes. (This product does not sting at all.) The pads are much softer than the Occusoft wipes, which are quite scratchy.	&&&
I bought these because my children hate using Kleenex and it was always a fight to wipe noses. Now with these wipes, my kids ask to wipe their nose. Great product and we love the grape smell!	&&&
Love these wipes! So convenient! I keep a pack in the car and at home.	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I loved these wipes! They were totally soft, and smelled great. They cleaned my son, no problems. I love that they are hypoallergenic so i dont have to worry about any allergies or rashes!	&&&
Huggies best brand and price for value	&&&
The best wipes on the market without chemicals.	&&&
Absolutely love these wipes for my new born. Out of all I used to prefer huggies until I tried these out. I will definitely continue to use these.	&&&
Very soft and strong wipes. Great scent with out the rash.	&&&
I've been using these wipes for my kids for the past 2 years. We absolutely love them. We keep packs of them in almost every room of the house including the car.	&&&
Love these unscented wipes! They really are strong and thick, just like the name says. I only need a couple for a poopy bum. They are very gentle on the skin, keeping my little one clean and fresh. We by them by the case!	&&&
Potty training is hardest when you're always on the go. With these soft packs of wipes we can keep some in the car, in the diaper bag, or even in a purse. All my children have very sensitive skin so these wipes are fantastic to make sure they are getting clean but won't have irritated skin from scented wipes. Great Product, Kandoo!	&&&
I love the convenience of the Clorox wipes! They smell great as well.	&&&
Kirkland wipes used to be great. These newer cheaper ones are awful! The flimsy packaging and cheap dispense top fall apart and then these cheap, thinner wipes dry out. Too bad they sacrificed the great quality they used to have for these. Sad	&&&
I love having Clorox wipes in the kitchen as I am cooking. I always worry about cross contamination with raw meat and I can easily wipe down spices and put them back as I am cooking while spicing up my dishes.	&&&
I wish this review was for the clorox scrubby wipes! I have used the Lemon wipes a few times and they work very good! I am more into the scrubby wipes from Clorox, but these are just as good! I am a Clorox fan all the way!!!	&&&
CLOROX AS ALWAYS PUTS OUT SIMPLE, EASY TO USE, RELIABLE PRODUCTS	&&&
Use these daily to keep the sink and counters clean.	&&&
I love using the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes! They are easy to use and very convenient for a germ-phob like me.	&&&
"These are a thumbs down for me. I usually use Clorox wipes but wanted to try these because they were more natural. The smell was strong and didn't smell like lemon as advertised. I am a teacher and I use wipes to clean the desks at my school. I just can't handle the smell so I'm going to see if another teacher might want them. They have plenty of good reviews so obviously the smell is ok for others.
The wipes are smaller than what I'm used to and the container was very difficult to open and once set up didn't dispense to well. I'm going back to Clorox."	&&&
I love clorox wipes and spray I use them both in my kitchem and bathroom, they help keep germs at bay and are a breeze to use, no sticky residue and no harmful smells...	&&&
Would use Clorox wipes over any other brand to kill germs and disinfect my home especially now during flu and cold season.	&&&
This is the only product I will use for laundry bleach and disinfecting wipes. Recently purchased the scrubbing wipe, one with ridges for a more deeper/easier clean and love the product.	&&&
I am a clorox addict. I have 5 dogs and 3 kids, so I am constantly cleaning. Clorox makes my job so much easier. We use clorox clean up, clorox wipes, clorox bleach, if it says clorox I buy it because I know its going to work great!	&&&
These wipes are so convenient to use all around the home and office. It is quick way to disinfect surfaces and door handles where most bacteria and viruses are found. I use them daily for safe cleaning and peace of mind to prevent spread of illnesses especially during the flu season. So, protect yourself and family by using them daily.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes!! Easy to use, convenient especially when your child is sick!	&&&
These were great to have on hand when I was pumping at work. I didn't always have access to a sink to wash all my pump parts. At least with the wipes, I was able to give the parts a quick wipe down before putting them away. So convenient! I'd definitely recommend keeping a pack of these in your pump bag!	&&&
"These are the best lens wipes I have ever used. All the other brands I've tried leave streaks and take multiple uses to clean the lens properly.

My routine now is to wash my glasses with soap and water, dab them dry with a cloth that does not harm lenses, and then finish them off with the Zeiss wipes.

All other brands I've tried have left droplets and streaks, which stay visible when dried. Get these."	&&&
Great custoner service!! Wipes are great! Love the scent	&&&
I love Huggies Natural Care wipes because they are made with natural products, are of great quality and get the job done! I've been using these wipes for years and I won't use any other brand! I even use them for everyday easy clean messes or even if I'm breaking a sweat from running around with the kids I use one to clean my face. It's as simple as that! They are amazing and useful wipes! Plus the fact that they keep my little ones bum free from rashes due to harsh chemicals that you might find in other wipes brands makes me happy! It's definitely a good buy!	&&&
I love disinfectant wipes, especially Clorox! They are convenient and easy to use. I am always confident that my surfaces are clean.	&&&
These wipes gave my newborn a horrible rash. No matter how often we changed her diaper or how much or how many different creams we used, our baby had a severe rash. It did not go away until we switched to target sensitive wipes.	&&&
I love using Clorox cleaning wipes for cleaning my stove and for quick bathroom cleaning.	&&&
The only wipes that don't give my boys rashes	&&&
I use clorox products for all my cleaning. I especially love the wipes. They are convient and come in handy when in a rush to clean up after small children.	&&&
These wipes are great- super convenient, and it's nice knowing you're not using any harmful chemicals on your dogs coat. The only thing is my package was a little dry when it arrived. I added some water to it, which seems to have solved the problem, but it is a bit of a quality control issue, I think. Other than that- this is a great deal.	&&&
I always keep wipes on hand. Bathroom, car, kitchen anywhere! There an amazing product and id recommend them to anyone	&&&
These wipes were a great deal when we were buying them.	&&&
I use Clorox Wipes on EVERYTHING!! I even keep them in my car. Not sure what I would do with out them!	&&&
Clorox wipes are good to have in the kitchen to wipe the sink.	&&&
Love for quick clean up. Downside is they streak my granite.	&&&
they smell great and I use them in every room of the house! we buy them on a regular basis	&&&
I keep Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in almost every room of the house! Easy to use and they always get the job done: easy cleaning and tough messes.	&&&
love clorox wipes makes the house smell and look clean	&&&
I prefer Clorox wipes over the store brand. They tend to stay together better and clean more. I keep them in my kitchen and every bathroom in the house for easy cleaning.	&&&
i love clorox wipes. they are so convenient and easy to use.	&&&
These wipes are wonderful! Even though baby girl doesn't have super sensitive skin these have helped us avoid diaper rashes. We used the huggies wipes a few times and her bottom stayed red. Switched back to pampers sensitive quick!	&&&
Easy to use to disinfect surfaces! Great for travel!	&&&
I've purchased cheap wipes to try to save on cost but they just don't compare to the Clorox brand. I really feel like Clorox disinfects and cleans more powerfully than any other.	&&&
I opened the box and instead of 8 packages of baby wipes inside there were only 5.	&&&
Our family uses clorox wipes for EVERYTHING! From wiping down counters, cleaning spills, wiping walls & cleaning bathrooms. Nothing works better! :)	&&&
I like the feel and gentleness of the wipes. They would be better if they didn't tear so easily. Even better would be less ingredients, but this is a start!	&&&
Clorox wipes are my favorite; they are so convenient to use. Just wipe and toss. I love the fresh clean sent. .	&&&
I love Clorox wipes, they are easy to use and get the job done!	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox disinfecting wipes. They are so convenient and make cleaning the bathroom and other things so easy. Then, you just toss the wipe when you are done, so the germs and bacteria go into the trash with it. Pretty much my favorite cleaning product!	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes because they are so convient to use. They also save money because we don't have paper towels to throw away after cleaning.	&&&
Clorox wipes are my go to item espeically now with a little one at home. Quick and easy to use and always gets the job done, without ripping or having to use a large quantity.	&&&
I like the multi-pack box to divide between home/grandma's and daycare. Nice when you need another dispenser as well. Always like the quality of the wipes and the variety of wipe packs. I use different ones for different places (ex: self-seal packs for daycare vs the packs that go in the dispenser at home) so it's nice to get the supply in one box versus having to buy different packages.	&&&
I love how easy and convenient the Clorox wipes are. I use them daily to disinfect my kitchen and dining area.	&&&
Purchased a box last year. Received as described. Only thing that bothered me was when I tried to enter the ALL the reward codes from my box of wipes, it had already been used. Whats up with that?????	&&&
I use these wipes for anything from my bathroom to my bedroom. Love them	&&&
My favorite wipes for all my kids!	&&&
I use these wipes for everything the smell is so fresh and it keeps the baby smelling like a new born baby.	&&&
love them! They are convenient and make things really clean! can be used on just about anything.	&&&
great amount of wipes for the price. wipes are thick and don't need many to get the job done.	&&&
I use these wipes on everything to keep the germs away	&&&
I like using the clorox wipes because all I have to do is pull one out, clean and done. With two little ones, a fast and easy clean is what I need. I am satisfied with the product and knowing that I am keeping my family healthy, is a peach of mind.	&&&
I love having these close by in the bathroom and kitchen for quick clean ups	&&&
"These wipes are the smelliest things I've smelled in a while. I couldn't tell if
I'd wiped my grandbaby enough or if it was the wipe! It's the wipes. Please change the scent ASAP. It sickens me. They are also flimsier."	&&&
These are the best wipes when I'm doing a quick clean up in the kitchen or in the living room	&&&
I, in good faith. ordered 12 canisters of this product. Today, I received an email stating that while my order was already shipped, I would be getting 1 canister not 12. Are they crazy? The price starts out at $60 and you expect us to believe this was for one canister. False advertising! This is unacceptable.Who in thier right mind would order 35 wipes for that price? Totally unacceptable!!!!!	&&&
I love using Clorox Disinfecting Wipes because they are easy to use and I have peace of mind of the clean surface that I am getting.	&&&
Having kids in the house makes Clorox Wipes a must have.	&&&
These wipes work great for my oldest son and my youngest daughter who has sensitive skin. I also am able to use them on my kids which is hard to find for me since my skin peels if I use to strong of scented wipes. Thank you for making a great product.	&&&
I love the Clorox product. My favorite product are the wipes. I keep one in my kitchen and one in my bathroom for quick cleanups.	&&&
I LOVE these wipes. They don't leave lint (unlike another brand) and clean with one wipe. They don't have any perfumes but still leave my baby girl smelling clean	&&&
I like Clorox wipes because they are convenient and kill 99.9 germs and bacteria.	&&&
love these- not too moist (like other wipes even those claiming to be sensitive)-- helped clear up diaper rash and good on my (mama's) sensitive skin, too.	&&&
These new and very different wipes are not as good as the older ones in the purple packages. They smell funny and aren't as soft. so if you are a huge fan of the older ones SORRY this is not the same. Last time I was in the store it looks like these are replacing the older ones.	&&&
I love these wipes! Especially now with my son walking... They are a life saver and a health saver! Did I mention a penny saver?	&&&
Along with everywhere else, I keep a canister in my car. They have come in sooooo handy! This way I ALWAYS have some Clorox wipes with me.	&&&
How tough stains on my kitchen,with clorox wipes no worries.Also it has multipurpose use.I really now my clorox wipes	&&&
My grandma used to use Pledge all the time when we lived in Antigua. Its still the best at cleaning and protecting furniture. I use these wipes on all surfaces in my apartment, including glass.	&&&
I love these wipes. Best option out there for the diaper bag since we do cloth at home (and on the go, but not the wipes, too hard to keep prewet ones in the bag ready to go). I was using pampers sensitive before this and hated the way they smell. These smell like nothing. Wipe well, don't fall apart, gentle.	&&&
I love these wipes! I feel good knowing I'm not wiping harsh chemicals onto my sweet baby! They clean well and are made of good quality material, they don't fall apart. It is lovely to be able to wipe your hands and other things clean with out smelling like a 2 year old sprayed purfume on you! I attempted to get them from a store near my home but they were frequently out of stock. It was so much easier to get them delivered to me in a case from trusty old Amazon. The wipes do dry a little after opening... I poor a little bottled/distilled water into the bag to rehydrate. Overall I am happy and will continue to purchase them IN BULK because I don't think my little one will quit pooping anytime soon!	&&&
These wipes are great. I love that they don't have that strong "wipe" smell.	&&&
WE LOVE THESE WIPES THE BEST.. WE ONLY NEED 1 ON DIRTY DIAPERS COMAPARED TO OTHERS WE WOULD HAVE TO USE 3 OR MORE.	&&&
Love theese wipes! Clean well hold up to tough cleaning! Use less than other brands, great value!	&&&
I wish I'd known about these and similar products sooner. I've had to deal with excessive sweating (mostly in the underarm area), since puberty, and now I almost never sweat through my shirts when I use these! One application lasts about 5 days for me. I'll usually save and re-use a wipe to get an extra two days out of it.	&&&
It works great and is very easy to use. My only complaint is that you can't put a bunch of wipes in it and expect the top ones to be warm. I find myself having to refill it everyday to ensure I get warm wipes every time.	&&&
These wipes are the best ! my baby was allergic to pampers so we tried these and havent had one problem ! and she has very sensitive skin	&&&
I've been using these wipes since my daughter was born. She's 21 months now. I order from Amazon, I have prime and signed up with Amazon Moms so I get the additional discount and free shipping. It really doesn't get much better!	&&&
"I have used many types of wipes and these are definitely in my top 5. We typically use Huggies Natural Care. We get the big boxes from Costco. I have also tried other type of wipes, such as ones from Wal-Mart.

These wipes come in the usual tub as well as travel sized wipes, which are a little bit smaller. The wipes are easy to get out and unlike some of the cheaper wipes, do not stick together. It isn't as moist as the Huggies brand but moist enough to get the job done. It also isn't as thick but it s definitely soft. I find that it does a great job of wiping up both my toddler and my baby. They are definitely sensitive as I have noticed that using these wipes have helped to take away any slight rashes.

I definitely like these wipes. They are not my favorite but do exceed my expectations."	&&&
The Pledge multi surface wipes work pretty well. They do work better for lighter jobs though. If you need to really scrub something to get it clean then I would choose a different cleaning product. I do like that you can use these on multiple surfaces. It's nice that one wipe can do many jobs around the house or at work. The pouch is nice because you can reseal it. The wipes have a good amount of cleaning liquid on them. The scent was alright. It wasn't anything great, but it still left an okay scent. It was still a clean smell. I didn't really notice any smudge or streaks after wiping with these. That was nice. The other thing that I liked was that they are just handy to have. If I have the time I will use other cleaning products, but if I'm in a hurry and looking to clean fast than these are just nice to have. You can just pull a wipe out and go around the rooms cleaning whatever is popping out. All in all these are pretty good cleaning wipes. I would buy them again.	&&&
Since I am somebody who hates germs but I also can not stand having spray cleaners and wash cloths touching my hands this is simply the greatest invention ever. It is one quick already moistened towelette away from a fantastically clean and very disinfected surface. The other great thing is that these wipes can be used anywhere at any time. I have them in the kitchen in the bathroom in the basement in the garage and even a pack in my car. Clean surfaces are abundance in my house now since the development of this product.	&&&
There is rarely a day I do not use these wipes. They are good for everything!	&&&
Love Clorox wipes! We keep them in every bathroom and in or kitchen! So convenient to grab and clean!	&&&
Every GUY needs DUDE WIPES in the OFFICE or in The FIELD, for GUY SIZED ISSUES. You won't be SORRY!	&&&
We can't live without these at cold season. My little guys nose is no longer raw and red because we use Boogie Wipes instead of tissues. What a difference!	&&&
By far my favorite wipes. Moist enough to accomplish the most arduous job. The fabric is as strong as other high quality wipes, but I find each Huggies natural wipe separates more easily from the pack than other brands. I had been using Pampers sensitive exclusively and tried these almost by accident, but have converted completely.	&&&
Great deal on the wipes.I use wipes every day, and usually get Lysol as they seem to last longer. We are entering the cold and flu season and I know that these ones will come very handy. I used them to clean everything from shoes, counters, tables, toys, phones, remotes etc...They do not dry out as fast as some other brands and the smell is very refreshing. If you really want a great deal order these through subscribe and save, this way you will never run out.	&&&
This makes cleaning so much better. Disposing the wipes instead of re-washing old rags gives me peace of mind! I stick one under the sink in the kitchen, under the sink in the bathroom, and one in the car. They are so handy! And it came within two days with prime pantry so couldn't be better!	&&&
Boogie wipes were so easy on my kids nose. It didn't give them that dry skin under there nose. Love them	&&&
Great wipe, not overly wet, has less amount of chemicals. I sometimes use it as my hand wipe as well.	&&&
I am so happy with these wipes! Of all the brands we've tried, these are the softest, they work great and don't irritate our baby's skin.	&&&
These are by far the best make-up removal wipes I have ever used. They did not leave my face feeling sticky and removed all of my mascara without irritating my eyes. I will continue to buy.	&&&
I was confused which brand's wipes I should use for my newborn. Luckily I received this free and clear wipes for free to try out. I like it as well as my baby. Its thick and soft on baby's bum. They are strong and make a tough job easier to clean up.	&&&
We first tried boogie wipes at Great Wolf Lodge. They are wonderful and so gentle on little noses.	&&&
I have bought these wipes since my son was 9 1/2 months old ! They are amazing	&&&
Kandoo is really a can do product. It say just whats in it title Kandoo handle all the mess and then flush it away. My children are love using these Kandoo wipes and I can rest knowing that I can trust Kandoo product for my children.	&&&
We have tried lots of wipes. These are awesome. They are super thick and don't irritate my sensitive skin toddler. If you are using them for something else than baby poops, you might prefer something thinner and more environmentally friendly, but otherwise these are our choice.	&&&
Great product. Use in my home and in the classroom.	&&&
"I’m not a naturally tan person. It takes more than just 30 minutes in sun for me to soak it up. I have to really work for it.! So I typically have to rely on a little extra help such as Sunless Tanners. But not all sunless tanners are made the same. And I have tried so many brands. Some are great and others make you look like an Oompa Loompa or even worse…a tiger. And nobody want’s that!
Let me introduce the GLOW2GO sunless tanning towelettes. I have never seen a sunless tanner that comes in a compact, to-go, package. One small box contains 20 individually wrapped premium towelettes. They are the perfect size to throw inside a purse or luggage for a quick gorgeous tan.
Even the box is designed for your convenience. The Super-saver box comes with a special ‘press to open’ area that will enable easy pulling of one towelette at a time. I love this. I have a big problem with losing something after I’ve taken it out of its designated spot. Now I don’t have to worry about that because the box can stay in the same spot until its empty. But let’s get to what’s really important: achieving a nice even glowing tan!

Inside the box contains 20 of these small towelettes that are concentrate with the innovative self-tan formula that is 70% Organic! And guaranteed or your money back to create a flawless, streak-free, waterproof tan.
I managed to get TAN LINES in January!! How crazy is that? No you can opt for a line free tan but I personally like to have tan lines. It sort of helps me gauge what I am now compared to what I looked like before I got so tan. I achieved this by applying the towelette while wearing my underwear. And this is only after one application.

The towelettes are easy to use. It takes only 2 towelettes to tan your entire body. That’s how super concentrated these wipes are. Just open one up and evenly rub them all over your body. It is recommend that you exfoliate and shave at least 2 hours before an application. I recommend wearing gloves and taking your time to make sure you don’t miss any spots. Then wait 10 minutes before getting dressed. And in 4 hours you will have a smile on your face and a glow to your whole body. And it another application is desired apply again after the 4 hour period.

Now I have to say, this product is pretty amazing. Not only did it stay true to everything it claims but it’s significantly different than most sunless tanners I’ve used. Before I was sent this product I used to HATE applying my old sunless tanners. Just because they left me feeling so sticky for hours. My body would stick to everything including itself. And then I would sweat because the tanners where just so heavy on my skin. With the Glow 2 Go towelettes, I’m not left with any of that uncomfortable stickiness. Withing 10 minutes after applying it absorbs into my skin and I feel fine. It’s not heavy feeling at all. Now there is a scent that comes with the application but it’s your typical sunless tanner scent. Only it’s not as strong as I’ve found other tanners to be, which is an added plus.

Overall, I have to say that I am more than pleased with the Glow 2 Go sunless tanning towelettes. And I think they have just become my new secret weapon for tanning on the go!
I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review."	&&&
I love the clorox wipes and keep them in my kitchen, bath, garage and vehicle. I DO NOT however, care for the lemon (actually lemon in ANYTHING), but no fear the green container is the way to go! Get them, use them and smile!	&&&
I love Clorox products for keeping my family healthy and our home clean. The wipes are so convenient to use, and leave every surface clean, disinfected and smelling fresh!	&&&
"These really are wonderful little wipes. I've used different wipes that did a good job of cleaning the lenses, but not to this level.
My lenses are as clear right now as the day I walked out of the eye doctor's office."	&&&
I love huggies, it's the only brand my mom ever used on me & my siblings & it's the only brand i'll ever use on my son. I love the way huggies wipes re soft & thick I dont need to use more than 3 to change a poopy diaper :)	&&&
We love these pampers wipes. They get the job done and work perfectly with my little ones sensitive bottom.	&&&
I love using the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. Having 5 kids in the house is already a challenge when trying to keep the house clean, but when I got Clorox by my side clean up is a breeze.	&&&
I use Clorox for almost everything except for cooking	&&&
These disinfecting wipes kill germs, are easy to use and have a nice smell. They are conveniently packaged."}},	&&&
Easiest and most efficient way to clean. I feel like they really disinfect my counters and other surfaces leaving it clean for my family.	&&&
"The clorox wipes are my absolute favorite extremely convenient
and easy to use. I have a canister in my kitchen, laundry room, and restroom to sanitize as I need."	&&&
I love Clorox wipes they are so easy to use and great for cleaning! I keep them in my car for spills.	&&&
The wipes are great! But Amazon keep charging my card after i received them smh.	&&&
These are great for quick cleanups, everywhere in the house. Unlike some bargain brands, the wipes are large and have plenty of cleaning solution. And they smell great, too. I would definitely recommend them, and would buy them again."}},	&&&
These wipes are really well made and work great, and a pretty decent price as well. However, it says unscented and they do have a scent to them and it isn't the most pleasant scent either >.< So I think i'll switch back to the regular huggies wipes, but other than that these are great :)	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. They are handy while disinfecting and Deodorizing. We always use these in our house	&&&
This is wonderful to use everywhere. I use the wipes at work in the car and at home.	&&&
Love, Love, Love Clorox wipes. I use them on everything and anything!! Great Product.	&&&
It is so easy to get the kids to help clean when mom is not home...by using Clorox fresh wipes!!! They all want to help!	&&&
Does what it is intended to, only gripe is that the wipes leave a slight streak that needs to be wiped by a cloth sometimes.	&&&
I have tried many different brands of wipes even the top competitor for huggies and they do not hold up like the Natural; care wipes. My little boy has sensitive skin and even when he gets a rash the natural care wipe do NOT aggravate the rash like other wipes do. They do not tear or leave fuzzy stuff behind when I use them. They are a very durable wipe. I always buy the Huggies natural care wipes above any other wipes. LOVE THEM!!	&&&
I like the product for the price that i paid. The wipes weren't as moist as I wanted, but it got the job done, and the duster worked work just fine.	&&&
Very pleased with this purchase. I think most baby wipes smell awful, but these have a clean, pleasant smell. I wish I found these before baby #3 turned 10 months old, but now that I know, I will buy these until he's out of diapers!	&&&
I use Clorox Clean Up Wipes to help keep home medical supplies disinfected.	&&&
It works just as well as any other brand of wipes at getting the makeup off, but I love that it's natural and gentler than other brands. It doesn't have strong alcohol that stings, doesn't cause redness or dryness or irritation. It's much more moisturizing than other brands, leaving my skin soft and clean. It's a decent cost for an all natural, skin-loving product. Good amount included, too, so it lasts a while.	&&&
easy and convenient to go use! I love the Clorox wipes I use them to disinfect steering wheel at work for my semi truck after someone else has used it they are great	&&&
I love these wipes. They are a super convenient easy way to disinfect and clean up after my kids/	&&&
I love these wipes. We were using another brand and when my son would start to get a diaper rash he would cry every time I wiped his butt because of the chemicals in the wipes so I started doing some research on more natural wipes and found these. They are a little more expensive than the other ones we used but worth it to not have the tears every time I change a diaper because I am hurting my baby. Being a working mother I don't have the time to make my own baby wipes so this is the next best thing!	&&&
I love anything Clorox. I really in love with the wipes. Just wipe and go	&&&
"They are very wet compared to the Expo branded wipes. After wiping down the board with these, i have to wait for it to dry or use a paper towel."	&&&
i have used clorox wipes for years and love how it smells and cleans without leaving any residue. i have a small pack in my car and purse for emergency.	&&&
I've wiped enough poop to say this is my wipe of choice. I buy generic diapers, but trust when I say, don't skimp on the wipes!!	&&&
The wipes are handy and gave my burgundy leather sofa a good shine and easy cleaning. One spot on my couch was dry and almost cracking, but after I used the wipe, it was softer and moister. Has no odor, which is nice. NOT good for spot cleaning - I rubbed with the wipe on a sticky spot - the burgundy color came off onto the wipe, but the stain did not come off. I followed the advice of other reviewers and put the wipes in a ziploc bag immediately after opening the container.	&&&
My daughter has really sensitive skin. We have tried several brands of wipes, but we keep coming back to pampers brand. The sensitive wipes are my favorite.	&&&
I am a women, wife, mom and nurse. I cannot live without Clorox Wipes Lemon. It's a everyday must have for me! It's a all-in-one product, that cleans, disinfect and deodorize ! So convenient for the modern day woman....Thank You !!!	&&&
I use these wipes in my classroom several times a week and love them! They clean very well and I ask for them at the beginning of every year!	&&&
Absolutely love Clorox products!!!!! i cant live without my clorox wipes and sprays.	&&&
LYSOL DISINFECTING WIPES ARE CONVIENENT TO USE. WE HAVE USED THEM FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT OUR FAMILY IS SAFE FROM GERMS. WE HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT BRANDS BUT COME BACK TO LYSOL EACH TIME. WE RECOMMEND THEM TO OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THE SCENTS ARE GREAT. WE USE THEM ALL."}},	&&&
I love these wipes. They don't try out after being opened like other brands I have tried. The value box is also a great buy!	&&&
With the flu going around at work, I like to keep these handy to keep my work space germ free! These are great!	&&&
Wipes work great. They are a quick clean & smell good too! I always feel like they sanitize really well."}}];	&&&
Best wipes you use around the house, with 3 kids under 6. Always something that needs to be wiped clean.	&&&
I tried many but this is the best wipes for dogs. My husband and I are clean freaks and use this wipe numerous times a day to clean the dog's paws when we come back from a walk. Also they stay moist until the last one.	&&&
I have a toddler who is constantly making messes. These wipes are super quick and effective!	&&&
I love to use Clorox wipes to disinfect my kitchen counters every day!	&&&
These wipes are very soft! I prefer them over other wipes. This pack is a great price. The 13x multpack comes with 3 pop-top travel packs which are great for the diaper bag.	&&&
Love the wipes. The best thing for cleaning toilets!	&&&
I love the wipes - nice to keep on the counter for quick cleaning. Very reasonably priced!	&&&
I work full-time, Clorox cleaning wipes are great for easy clean up when your life is so busy.	&&&
The wipes work great! You get a lot for your money and they do not streak, Definitely reccomend	&&&
these wipes work well as anticipated. fresh scent isn't too overwhelming.	&&&
This is strong enough to clean anything also gentle on my baby's skin	&&&
used this on my niece wipes them right off And feel soft	&&&
These wipes are reasonably priced and work just as good as name brands.	&&&
The best wipes ever made Iam so happy with product	&&&
Amazing wipes& a great price!	&&&
I love these wipes. The only complaint I have for them is that the tear easily which isn't enjoyable when changing diapers. Other than that I'm happy with them and they work well for both of my boys with sensitive skin.	&&&
These are the best wipes for newborns. They are soft and don't cause diaper rash like tough hugged onesm .	&&&
Not sure I love these wipes but am giving them a second chance as my previous preference seems to dry out so easily. I am going to give these a fair shot and see if I prefer them.	&&&
We are a family of 5, and these are the only wipes I have ever found that make everyone in the family happy!! These are unscented and made for sensitive skin and they have never caused any irritation for any of us. They are truly flushable and do not clog the toilets, which was a common problem with other brands of wipes. I can't say enough good things about these - ever since I discovered them, I have refused to buy any other wipes. Thanks for the fabulous product!!	&&&
The price was great but the quality is not great. They are not as moist as I had hoped and rip too easily. I think I'll go back to the costco wipes!	&&&
I am so happy that I had a chance to try the Kandoo flushable cleansing wipes. My 8yr old son is still struggling to fully clean his bottom after going poop. He overuses toilet paper and parts of it tears and makes a huge mess in the bathroom. Worst part is that he still isn't clean. He comes later itching or needing a shower...lots of times I just find him walking funny. So, this forces me or dad to have to go wipe him everytime. Kandoo wipes have given him the independence and cleanliness he needed. He is able to do it all himself. And the kid-friendly packaging has encouraged him to use them. He doesn't feel ashamed and thinks that it is cool to use.	&&&
"I like this product but you can just use regular wipes as well for the same thing, so I'm not quite sure I would purchase it again."	&&&
The only wipes I was able to use on all three of my girls from birth on with sensitive skin.	&&&
I like trying things that seem easy to use. Cleaning is not fun for me and the faster that I can go with it the better. I wasn't sure how these would work and my end result was that they were just alright. It really didn't save me much time because Windex spray bottles were just easy to carry around, squirt and use. It really didn't help much in that area. Also these wipes didn't work the best. The spray bottles are better for leaving streak free glass. These leave streaks sometimes. They are handy to just pull out and use, but they are a little expensive. I just didn't find these worth it. This product wasn't my favorite. I probably won't be buying this	&&&
I was excited to get a bunch of these wipes for my baby shower but disappointed to find out that they were not as natural as I had hoped.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes to use of all! I do use several of the others too	&&&
These are decent wipes. They are not as thick as pampers, but they have enough moisture to do the job and are soft enough that they do not irritate baby's skin. I do like pampers better, but I buy these from time to time because they are quite a bit cheaper.	&&&
I love using these wipes for small cleaning jobs. They work great and disinfect things at the same time. Much easier than spraying cleaner everywhere!	&&&
I am not sure if wipes are supposed to be dry, but these came out dry.	&&&
"I love this product!!!! I love that I can have it near my changing table at home or take it on the go and plug it to my car. I love and appreciate that at night when my little one needs a diaper change when I wipe her she feels the nice warmth in the wipes and doesn't wake up screaming out of her sleep. No more cold wipes for my baby's bum bum (until summer weather that is)!!"	&&&
Wipes were "soured" smelled terrible, I have used Equate wipes before, this is the first time for this "Clean Scent", had to return them...will try the scent I usually buy.	&&&
I've been using this brand on my kids for years and have saved a lot of money. These are just as good, if not better than other more expensive name brands. I love how soft and gentle they are. They are pretty sturdy and durable. They have just the right amount of moisture and this box is a great deal for how many wipes you get in each package. I love buying this box and putting away a couple then keeping one in house and one in the diaper bag. And these ones are fragrance free so I don't have to worry about my daughter as she has sensitive skin. I love these and highly recommend to all parents. Save yourself money and get the better product anyway, Parents Choice!	&&&
Harsh on eyes, terrible smell. I was really surprised because I love all of the other Neutrogena Wipes. Still recommend the blue package as a first choice.	&&&
I was a fan of the original wipes, but Earths Best changed them. Why mess with a good thing? Now they're slippery and make more of a mess then they help. They smell weird, too, so it's obvious that they also changed the formula. We're so disappointed. We're canceling the subscribe and save and giving away the remainder of our case.	&&&
I love these wipes! I particularly enjoy the convenience of the 10 count package. I keep them everywhere...in the car, in my purse, on the bedside table. Thank you for understanding the needs of your customers.	&&&
Several times when my grandchildren are over, they go to the bathroom and tell me my toilet won't flush. They were using a roll of toilet paper each time! (Maybe a half a roll!) I was always using a plunger! I then decided to purchase Kandoo and my problem was solved. It made them clean with one, possibly 2 Kandoo wipes. I also purchased it for their house and my daughter loves it! In the end you save money.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes for cleaning the kids bathroom and for their school rooms	&&&
I live by Clorox wipes. I use them in my bathroom and kitchen.	&&&
Love using the wipes to make sure every part of my home is clean and disinfected.	&&&
As a wife and Mother I can never have enough Clorox disinfecting wipes in my house. I love the product!! It cleans literally everything and smells amazing!	&&&
I clean my counter tops.door knobs anything in the house with these wipes Great For Everday Cleaning !! i Keep Them in my bathroom to wipe the tolet seat daily .	&&&
I love the pampers sensitive baby wipes because of the size and softness.	&&&
I have ordered and used thousands (no exaggeration) of these wipes. I seldom go anywhere without one iin my shirt pocket	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes in the bathroom so I don't have to worry about getting my washcloths all icky! I can just toss them and not worry about extra laundry!	&&&
You get a lot of wipes but they are thin. I had to double up to use them.	&&&
I love them and my husband loves them too. We use them in our kitchen all the time. Not only do they clean very well but they leave the kitchen smelling so fresh.	&&&
With four kid and one on they way I usually use the disinfectant wipes, because the easy to grab. Love on convient they are amd affordable.	&&&
Your Clorox wipes are fantastic, but there has to be a better way to get those last few wipes out of the canister...	&&&
Love Love love these wipes. They are perfect for little hands and easy to transport on any trip. We stock them everywhere!!	&&&
I love theses disinfecting wipes. I keeps a canister in each room of my house.	&&&
I bought this a month ago and so happy i did my children love the grape sent. They would rather use boogie wipes and nothing else it is ao soft on there noise, so dont have to worry about there noise being raw.	&&&
Nice wipes. The have enough moisture in them to wipe off dirt and great for the messy jobs!!	&&&
I originally purchased for my granddaughter, but when I saw how well they worked on her poor red nose, I knew they were what we all needed. I keep them in the bathroom for general use, beside my bed, in the car, and at work. I regularly borrow them out to coworkers, and highly recommend for all ages. There is nothing that compares to Boogie Wipes. Tough enough for blowing noses, moisturizers without feeling there is "stuff" on your nose, smells great, light weight, and has multiple uses whenever you need any type of a moist wipe.	&&&
These wipes were very gentle and cleaned even the biggest messes with ease. I have no complaints.	&&&
Seriously? $6 buys you 168 flushable wipes from a big box store. Put a dozen at a time in zip lock bags and you've just saved yourself $24 on this branding hype product. This product is a con.	&&&
As a mom of 2 with sensitive children, I highly recommend these wipes.	&&&
Best wipes out there! So soft, stay nice and wet as long as you keep the package sealed, and never cause any irritation on my baby's little parts because it's mostly water! Genius.	&&&
These wipes are so soft and just the right amount of wetness. I would recommend them for any child who has sensitive skin or any parent who just prefers softer wipes.	&&&
cleans well but pop up wipes a bit small for cleaning TV	&&&
I do NOT like the new formulation of these wipes. They are thinner and smaller than the previous version--NOT what you want in a cleansing wipe. Please go back to the old version!	&&&
I am usually not a huge fan of Huggies wipes, but I had never tried these before and they were on sale so I got them. I was pleasantly surprised and I actually really like them. They are softer then normal Huggies wipes and they seem to have more moisture which I really like.	&&&
As a college student, I need to clean things fast and effectively, and that's what these wipes help me do.	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes because I am able to clean up messes and know that I am disinfecting them at the same time. I can rest assured knowing that my surfaces are free from germs and viruses.	&&&
Love the Lysol wipes makes cleaning and disinfecting EASY!	&&&
I love these wipes, we generally use Costco wipes, but these smell better. Also, Costco wipes have a terrible habit of coming out of the package two or three at a time and I don't have that issue with the Amazon wipes.	&&&
Very easy to sanitize your whole house!! Especially with kids...	&&&
"I was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm glad I decided to try the Glow2Go Towelettes. The colour truly is natural looking and streak free. I was expecting some sort of orange colour but I'm happy that it turned out the way it did.

The wipes are easy to use. One wipe is good for half of your body so you'll need two to do your full body. One application provides a shade up from your normal colour. Well, this was the case for myself anyway. I did a second application after the required four hours and the colour was nice and dark. Two applications should be enough for most people if you're looking for a nice, dark tan.

The towelettes have a very subtle scent to them. They smell like tanning lotion. Personally, I don't mind the smell. I kind of like it. The towelettes feel damp. They don't feel greasy, oily, or leave any residue on the skin. It absorbs quickly, I'd say it takes only a minute or two.

The only ""con"" I could say that this product has is the ingredient list. It contains parabens. I know that this can make or break a purchase for some people so it's worth noting. It'd be great if they found preservative alternatives for their product.

Overall, I'm really happy with the wipes. I plan to purchase more once I finish this box."	&&&
These are great - I just ordered my 2nd box. I wear eyeglasses daily and would panic if I didn't have these wipes. They work so much better than the spray and microfiber cloths. They also work great for cleaning my cell phone as well as my laptop computer screen. Some lens wipes are too wet and leave big streaks, but these are just right.	&&&
Love these wipes!	&&&
"I always have Clorox wipes on hand at my house. I have come to trust the results from Clorox wipes and they work great, no matter what I throw at them.

I travel often for work. When I first started to travel, I got sick constantly. I decided to take OCD precautions to stop getting sick and bring home the germs to my little kids. One of the OCD things I do is wipe down surfaces on public areas where I will be for long periods of time. For instance, I wipe down my arm rests, tray table, and anything around me while on an airline. In my rental car, I wipe down the keys, steering wheel, door handle, etc. Finally, in my hotel, I wipe down the door knobs, sink knobs, remote control, and anything else I touch often. I went from literally always being sick when traveling to going more than a year without being sick once. I attribute a great deal of that to these!"	&&&
This warmer deserved 5 stars ... before tonight. My daughter is 4 months old, and at 6:30 this morning she woke for a feeding so I went into her room to find a bright light on the front of the warmer on. It startled me, because I didn't even know it was a light! It had never come on before this and I've unplugged and plugged it in several times. I didn't remember ever reading about it having a light. To my disappointment, it does not shut off or dim!!! It is a very bright light in my opinion. I got online and read under questions answered that others put tape or a towel over it. My daughter is extremely observant, and if it is not dark in her room at night it will keep her up. The warmer is unplugged right now, I will put tape over it in the morning. I'm not excited about how tacky it's going to look, but o well. It functions great tho. Keeps our wipes wonderfully warm. We have used baby washcloths that we bought from babies r us since day one. I did not like the wipes that came with it, I use those as washcloths.	&&&
I'm a new mom, and was not sure if my baby was going to need special wipes or diapers so I went with a product that I knew would be gentle and right for a brand new baby bottom. Luckily my baby has never gotten a diaper rash, and I know that these wipes play a role in ensuring she is always clean, fresh, and not irritated during changes. I really recommend these for anyone that is worried their baby may have sensitive skin.	&&&
i can't live without this Clorox disinfecting wipes i used everywhere i go with my toddler	&&&
I like these, they are very good on price, however the wipes are not as durable as I'd like and I've used better. I'm sure they can improve, after all this is only their first round making wipes.	&&&
love Clorox best wipes ever . will never buy any other brand	&&&
I love these wipes because once your done with them you can just throw them away. No mess no fuss and you understand that everything is being disinfected at the same time. Awesome	&&&
I love the wipes especailly because it is easy to use. Especially since it has a lemon scents you do not think its clorox.	&&&
I love clorox disinfecting wipes they are quick and easy and with the name clorox I know its clean	&&&
Absolutley no problems at all I should have gotten 2 just in case. I really appreciated the screen cleaning wipes that came with it.	&&&
I love using clorox wipes. They are great for home, and for my first grade classroom, especially during cold and flu season ;)	&&&
I love the clorox wipes. makes cleaning up messes easy!	&&&
with having 4 kids Clorox wipes are so convenient and easy to use and toss.	&&&
"These disinfecting wipes kill germs, are easy to use and have a nice smell. They are conveniently packaged."	&&&
I love Huggies Natural Care wipes because they are made with natural products, are of great quality and get the job done! I've been using these wipes for years and I won't use any other brand! I even use them for everyday easy clean messes or even if I'm breaking a sweat from running around with the kids I use one to clean my face. It's as simple as that! They are amazing and useful wipes! Plus the fact that they keep my little ones bum free from rashes d ue to harsh chemicals that you might find in other wipes brands makes me happy! It's definitely a good buy!	&&&
These wipes have more moisture than all the others I've tried. The way they are packaged more tightly and the quality of the opening will preserve the products freshness and moisture longer. Not to mention, they are priced well.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are awesome I recommend it for everyday use to anybody.	&&&
It's a three pack. Remarkably one of the containers had no wipes in it, just half filled with the soap/fluid. Probably just a fluke, but figured I should mention it.	&&&
"I have been testing out the new sanitizing wipes by Softy and they are absolutely fabulous. I have used them for practically everything, especially since my daughter and I have been fighting this horrible cold.

I have used them on all my remotes, game controllers, laptop, phone, door knobs, switch plates, counter top, bathroom sink area, and many other places.

There are several reasons why I love these wipes, starting off with they are alcohol free, they come in a 150ct container, the wipes measure 7x8 inch, they have a very light citrus fresh scent, and yes they still kill 99.9% of germs.

To answer many peoples question, yes they are made in the U.S.A! These wipes are made with vitamin e and aloe as well. Softy Wipes are very thick, sturdy and stretchy too!

The active ingredient in Softy Wipes is benzalkonium chloride 0.13%, which is an antiseptic, and also means non-toxic.

I love these and they do not trigger my migraines. unlike many others that are highly perfumed and with toxic fumes."	&&&
I use the wipes everyday to wipe out the sink and counter tops	&&&
one of the best wipes around. use them all the time at home.	&&&
Love Love Love the Clorox Disinfecting wipes. Have them in all the culprit rooms...kitchen, bathroom, changing table for the baby. Couldn't live without them!	&&&
I am a first time mother so i tried all kinds of different wipes but it seemed like every brand i tried there was always an issue. i tried huggies and they tore way to easy so i tried parents choice and my daughter was breaking out from them and then i got pampers natural clean and i have not one complaint. i would reccommend this product to anyone	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes! They keep my kitchen and bath sparkling. And I love that they are disposable!	&&&
Used the wipes to clean up my stove top and it was easy to do and left a nice shine!	&&&
love it the product best cleaning product I have tryied so far	&&&
I keep these in several rooms in my home to easily grab to clean up messes and it leave a great clean smell.	&&&
On subscribe and save, I get these cheaper than any other disenfecting wipes option! Lysol makes a great product as always.	&&&
Love disinfecting wipes. So easy to use and so convenient.	&&&
These wipes work well. I like that they are not too wet but not dry. And they are easy to get out of the package. It comes with a box you can put them in.	&&&
very good wipes. gentle and has the arm and hammer name. Need I say more?	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They make it so easy and convenient to clean my bathroom.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for disinfecting desks in the classroom!	&&&
I have been using it on the cats too. It is minty and they deal with the wipes better than a toothbrush.	&&&
Enjoy the wipes for the convenience and it disinfects.	&&&
Clorox wipes clean great! I never worry about things being clean and germ free when I use them!!	&&&
I like the Clorox wipes because they are thicker than other brands and also because they disinfect and are disposable.	&&&
Clorox is a good product for quick cleanings and disinfecting.	&&&
I love the ease of these wipes! so convenient. Just wish they were cheaper	&&&
These wipes are way better than the generic brand. The others just smear while these actually cling to the mess and get the job done quicker, better and with less wipes, which saves time and money.	&&&
Unlike the brand I bought at PetCo, my dogs seem to tolerate the flavor of these dental wipes better. Plus, they do smell minty, which really helps when the dog decides to pant directly in your face, which dogs are known to do.	&&&
I love how convenient they are especially when I need to wipe down the kitchen or bathroom quickly.	&&&
Clorox wipes are awesome. They knock out the toughest stains, easy to use and non irritating to the skin.	&&&
I love the disinfecting wipes! I keep them in my kid's bathroom at all times. I have 2 boys and they know that if they make a mess on the toilet or counter, they just need to grab a wipe and clean it up.	&&&
I'm very particular when it comes to wipes. So far these have been my favorite. Soft, gentle on my son's skin. Only complaint is packaging. I buy the bulk boxes and it'd be nicer if each pack had the flip top (like many other brands do) rather than having to use the bigger containers.	&&&
With 2 kids and 3 dogs I use a lot of Clorox wipes.	&&&
I've used these a couple times and love them! I love coconut and the scent is not bad. It takes my makeup off and feels clean and moisturizer on my dry sensitive skin. Love the size of the wipes too! Big enough to use on my face and neck. Worth buying!!"}	&&&
I'm a teacher and I love the convenience of the wipes to quickly wipe down desks at the end of each day! (knock on wood) I haven't been sick this year at all!	&&&
These wipes are the best. They take off all of my makeup, including eye makeup. They must use hydrating oils which wouldn't seem like a good idea for me to use, but it works. I have VERY sensitive/ combo skin and these have not irritated me once. I can also use these in the a.m. to get all of my night routine off and they prep my skin for my primer/makeup routine.	&&&
Love the boogie wipes. Works great for those winter months when your kids noses just don't stop running. They're soft and smell great so the kiddos don't run at the sign of you pulling them out.	&&&
These tear waaaay too easily! They are also less moist than the Pampers so you have to use more of them. Then there is the packaging, there are way too many wipes in each plastic package! Even after separating one pack into three different containers, the containers are packed so full that they don't completely close.	&&&
I love these wipes! They are so handy to have in the bathroom and kitchen of your house to wipe up quick messes!	&&&
I am a huge fan of Clorox. I love the wipes and how easy they are to clean up messes quick.	&&&
"Staples dry erase wipes by Quartet are an excellent item for the price. My classroom whiteboard is old and difficult to keep clean. I have tried several products to no avail of cleaning my board. Even the dry erase spray with a clean cotton rag doesn't do the job. Staples wipes are the only product I have found that will actually clean the board thoroughly."	&&&
Armor All is the Best! My car is not considered clean until I use these wipes! I do not know what ingredient is in them that makes them work so well, but it works so well! The dashboard, steering wheel, console, and anything non-material in the car gets so clean with these. It sucks up the dust and puts a shine unlike any other chemical or cleaner can do. It keeps it clean for about a month too, so it is worth the fifteen minutes it takes to simply wipe the surfaces. The wipes are great because you can get them into all the little cracks that are everywhere in vehicles and make them look sparkling new. The smell is weird, but great because it brings back somewhat of a nostalgic "new car" smell that cannot truly be achieved. One wipe lasts for a good while and it does not take more than five wipes to clean all the surfaces in your car unless there are massive piles of dust. If this were the case I would recommend wiping with a simple damp cloth first and then use Armor All to achieve the wonderful shine effect after it is somewhat clean.	&&&
I use it when my eyes tear up while driving It happens time to time I'm not sure if dirt or sweat cause it, but wipes are really handy for it just remember to keep them close enough so it doesn't affect your driving	&&&
These wipes get the job done and they are fine but I wish they were thicker. I can find store brand that are thicker and better in price.	&&&
Gets the job done and doesn't take an entire package to do it.	&&&
from hands and door handles in flu season to buffet serving utensils, these wipes will find use everyday of your life. ....Three in the pocket before leaving the house will get you through most days germ free.	&&&
This was advertised as a pack of four 20 count hand wipes, but it was only one pack of 20.	&&&
I love these wipes! They always smell great, they clean really good, and they don't stick together real bad when you are pulling them out of the holder like some of the off brands do. very convenient!	&&&
Clorox Lemon Fresh Disinfecting Wipes work really well around the house for a lot of different applications. I mostly use them in the bathrom for around the sink and outside parts of the toilet. I also like to use them on doorknobs and cabinet handles occasionally, especially after anyone in the house has been sick.	&&&
have used other wipes, sensitive wipes from Pampers are the best	&&&
Never have had an issue with these wipes, and I have bought them numerous times. They are sturdy and soft while having natural ingredients that I feel comfortable putting on my baby. These are the only kind of wipes we will buy!	&&&
These wipes are large, strong, and sweet smelling. They make you feel clean and good about yourself after you have sex. I def recommend getting these.	&&&
These are the only wipes I buy! Cleans well, soft on my son's bottom and more durable than other brands.	&&&
it does have a pleasant smell but I feel the texture is little rough	&&&
I don't think it is ever possible to make a bad decision in purchasing 'Clorox Lemon Fresh Disinfecting Wipes' or any other scent of this product, for that matter. The scent is just enough to leave a lasting odor-eating smell but not enough to still over power you with chemical fumes. I originally purchased these for my household of 4 males and myself to keep in the bathroom to clean up seat sprinkles when the boys forget to put up the seat. The boys actually started using these themselves and led to them wanting to take them outside of the bathroom setting into the rest of the house to help me clean without me having to ask!	&&&
This product is perfect and less cost for New born Baby. I like this product for my new born baby. I recommand to use this product, But there have 7 plastic packet, No plastic box.	&&&
this wipes have substance, they feel soft and thick. They are pleasantly scented and yet not overly perfumey. will order again	&&&
These wipes work great. Very easy to use, no yucky residue when used properly. I highly recommend this product for all of your silver.	&&&
These are great. My baby has sensitive skin and these don't irritate her or cause breakdown. Clean well because of thickness and have to use less so save money. Love there is no perfume smell to them	&&&
These are the best makeup remover wipes I have ever found at the drugstore! They get every bit of makeup off in one fell swoop. I do not have to use a second wipe to get things done, either,since the wipes are a substantial size. And they also smell fresh and clean and leave my skin fresh, clean and a tad moisturized. Very, very gentle on skin too. I have sensitive skin and it has never been riled up by these wipes. Definitely a winner!	&&&
I became obsessed with learning about baby wipes when my little guy developed a rash from Huggies Natural Care wipes. What I found in my research disgusted me. Known irritants and dangerous preservatives and chemicals make up so many of the "mainstream brands" and have caused many unnecessary and painful rashes on our babies. Pampers wipes-awful, Huggies wipes-forget it. Earth's Best, Gdiapers, Water Wipes are some of the safe ones. #If I could go back in time I would use Water Wipes on my newborn as they have NO preservates and 2 ingredients-water and grapefruit seed extract# Please don't think that just because the product says "sensitive" it is. Do your research. Unfortunately some of the good brands are super expensive so Earth's Best offered me the best of both worlds-safe for my baby's sensitive skin AND affordable. You will not be dissapointed with this brand and I am so happy to see Walmart carry the safer, healthier, less toxic brands-Finally!	&&&
"If you're thinking of keeping a couple of these in your wallet for emergencies---like that condom you carried through high school, only more likely to be used----the packaging is too bulky to serve that purpose well.

Would prefer a profile more on the line of a ""moist towelette."""	&&&
The wipes are so convenient and easy to use. Love all Clorox products! Use in the laundry, kitchen and bathroom and make everything clean and fresh smelling!! Thank you for great products!	&&&
"Durable wipes that smell pleasant. Keeps moist a long time after opening. Best wipes available."	&&&
Awful. They fell apart when I was trying to pull them through the tub. They are a lot more rough than the Pampers ones too. I will not be ordering these again or even using up the current stock. I do not understand the great reviews... did I get a different product??	&&&
Huggies natural wipes are the best brand out their to buy. I been buying 4 years now and still on going. I love how it is soft.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They are easy to use and freshen everything up!	&&&
I have two kids and things get messy on a regular basis. But I know I can always clean up any mess they make with the help of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes.	&&&
It's a Family favorite. My kids love to help clean just to use the wipes. I also use them in my car and at work. LOVEE !!	&&&
Great thick wipes that does the job.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are perfect to use in my son's preschool classroom. They make for quick and easy cleaning and they disinfect at the same time!	&&&
I love having the Clorox wipes in my home! They make clean-up a breeze in any room, especially the kitchen and bathrooms! I never like to be without them.	&&&
I like the way clorox wipes works when I clean my bathroom and clean up spills!	&&&
These are the only wipes I have used since my son was born - they work great and we have never had any problems with them. I highly recommend them.	&&&
These wipes smell amazing! Just like you would expect a new baby to smell like. They provide a quality clean.	&&&
I have loved Clorox wipes from day one! I have a container in every room!	&&&
I love how easy these wipes are to use. They clean and disinfect easily, leaving my kitchen and bathroom smelling fresh.	&&&
I've had these on subscribe and save for a while and suddenly the texture of the wipes has changed. They are thinner and tear when you pull them from the container. May switch to Clorox as there is a similar deal with a few less wipes but the price is comparable and I like Clorox better.	&&&
I love these wipes as a mother of 3 children and 4 pets, they are an essential in my house!	&&&
it is awesome. I only wish all products worked as well as Clorox Wipes in my kitchen, bath and laundry room.	&&&
We purchased these for our office and we've probably only used them a few times. The quality itself is bad, they are not even moist enough, to thin, and must agree with most of these reviews they rip super easily as your pulling them out of the container. THE WORST PART OF IT ALL, THEY TURNED MOLDY!!!!!! As we started tearing the wipes off we noticed it was black and started getting worse and worse, so we finally threw out a few of them and what did we see toward the middle it was full of MOLD!!!!!! WORST PURCHASE EVER!!! DONT BUY THEM.	&&&
PURELL Sanitizing Hand Wipes Individually Wrapped 100-ct. Box I like the fact they are individual. Not only good on my hands but on surfaces.	&&&
I was pleasantly surprised when I opened my pack of wipes. I didn't expect them to be so thick and sturdy. I'm used to thinner huggies and pampers wipes, so this was a nice change. They got the job done, smelled nice, had just the right moisture content. Highly recommended for your precious baby! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I really like using Pampers Sensitive wipes. Very gentle on my baby's bottom. I will definitely buy and use again.	&&&
Every time around this year (cold season) I have to stock up on boogie wipes! I keep a pack at home and a pack in my diaper bag. These are so great for babies. They are gentle on their little noses and when the babies get a runny nose and you are blowing their nose all the time you need these! I have been using these for 4 years and I know I will continue to keep buying in the future!	&&&
I know sometimes as parents we buy things that aren't always necessary. But I love using boogie wipes for my son especially when he has a cold. It makes his poor runny nose feel so much better with the moist scented wipes	&&&
These cleaning wipes are great for eye glasses of any kind.	&&&
Wipes clean great. Great product and pricing.	&&&
Amazing product, am fortunate to have been given a sample and haven't gone back since! Was able to clean a poopy diaper with just two wipes!! They are large, sturdy and best of all safe for sensitive skin!	&&&
These are hands down the BEST baby wipes. Chemical-free, they stay moist, and are very durable for wiping babies bottom!	&&&
Love these wipes. So soft and not too strong of a scent for their little noses. Highly recommend.	&&&
I LOVE these wipes! They are very thick so I don't have to use as many on those messy diapers. These are now the only wipes I will buy.	&&&
There wasn't anything special about these wipes. They did the job. The packaging is nice, sturdy and small. You can throw them in your bag for on the go purposes. I don't think that it gets all of my make up off because when I use toner, I'm still wiping a little bit of residue off.	&&&
I LOVE these wipes!One of the coolest kiddo inventions. Good for any mess on the face/nose.Always give these to new parents as part of my "faves" for their baby shower gifts.	&&&
I appreciated these wipes even more after using Huggies! They are soft, moist, and I appreciate that they come in 7 individual packets because then each packet can be placed in our wipes container one at a time without the others drying out.	&&&
I came across Method all-purpose cleaning + disinfecting wipes one day while shopping in Target. I decided to purchase the Method orange zest scented wipes instead of the typical antibacterial wipes that I usually purchase, due to the fact that these wipes were less expensive and came in my favorite scent. After using the Method all-purpose cleaning wipes for the first time, I was very disappointed. There was a very profound artificial fragrance to these cleaning wipes. I could only detect a very light orange scent, but overall, the smell of the wipes was very unpleasant. The worst part about the scent was I could not get the smell off my hands after using these wipes. I also did not think these cleaning wipes cleaned as well as other wipes I have used in the past. I had to use several wipes in order to clean up my counter tops. The only good thing about these wipes was that they did not irritate my hands, like other disinfecting wipes do after I use them. Overall, Method all-purpose cleaning + disinfecting wipes may be inexpensive, but they do not perform nearly as well as other disinfecting wipes.	&&&
Armor All Cleaning Wipes really are the best shine for your money. They make your car look good as new. I've used them to clean up a wide variety of things from my car's seats, to include that spray on hair dye they use at parties, spilled sodas that started to stain, just the usual grime and grit from being used so often, and grubby hand prints on the dash to spilled soda on the consoles of the car from a near miss. They are easy to use and come in pre-moistened wipes that come in a canister to keep them all together. And like most other canister wipes, they have a pronged top that stops them all from coming out at once. You take what you need and the rest stay inside it, moist as long as the lid stays closed. Swiping them across your leather or other seats and dashboard and console keep it clean and shiny, and looking brand new. I even use them on the hub caps at times. Makes the chrome on those look shiny and new, too. And here in Alaska where it snows a lot, that means a lot to have a new looking car, because of all the grit and grime that comes with ice and deicer and melting snow and mud. So Armor All Cleaning Wipes helps me keep my car looking like a million bucks.	&&&
Everyone in my family uses these wipes. They work great at cleaning and are just the right amount of softness.	&&&
I love these when my son is getting a cold or stuffy nose takes the dryness and boogies right off with these wipes. Love the smell and these don't dry out so fast. LOVE THEM!	&&&
Boogie wipes is an easy-to-use, the apparent good aroma duckies after! Place it in a small, so convenient without it being too bulky bag	&&&
Best wipes ever! I first started using Hinest Wipes until my husband came home from the store wipe Seventh Generation wipes and fell in love ever since! At first I got mad because he didn't get the right ones but after using them I couldn't stop thanking him!! Lol Daddy to the rescue for helping finding these awesome soft and gentle wipes!!!	&&&
I love this product. I've found that they're the best makeup-removing wipes I've used.	&&&
These wipes work so well! And the grape ones smell amazing! :-) These seem to be so much more gentle than anything else!	&&&
My daughter absolutely loves these wipes. She will not use Kleenex or anything else. She loves the way they smell and loves that they don't irritate her nose. I am a lifelong user!!	&&&
Pretty standard wipes, I do think the packaging holds up much better than the generic brands.	&&&
We absolutely love boogie wipes in my household. It makes messy, dried-on boogies a lot easier to clean up. They are soft and gently on the nose.	&&&
We tried the Unscented Boogie wipes on my two grandchildren and we would recommend them for young sensitive noses that are prone to redness!	&&&
I bought this wipes about a year ago and ever since I always have them in my house, in my car, in my purse. My kids like them but I secretly love them and used them myself. They work great for my allergies. No more tissues!	&&&
Love that Boogie Wipes are easy to carry and my nephews love them, always have one handy in the car and one at home!!	&&&
this time got 2 as my in laws wanted some!!	&&&
Wipes are excellent but they didn't come in another box so it got a little damage but didn't damage the product.	&&&
i love using Clorox wipes gets the job done fast and easy.	&&&
I like using these on my toddler much better than Germ X wipes which he promptly licks off which cannot be a good thing...I will order more of these wipes.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are convenient and leave everything smelling fresh and clean.	&&&
These have been super strong and moist for the dirtiest of diaper changes, yet soft. It doesn't leave a weird residue behind either. I use these everywhere--face, hands, feet, diaper area... I absolutely can't stand Pampers wipes for the perfumes, the residues, and how flimsy, porous, and dry they feel. The name pretty much says it all-simply clean!	&&&
I always use clorox wipes to clean my home. whether it be a tough stain or just to sanitize my countertops. It is my go to product.	&&&
Love cleaning quickly with my Clorox wipes. Easy and convenient as a mom of four!	&&&
THe's are great quality, many other brands tear easy. Even when just pulling them out of the packagr, didn't have that problem with Pampers Wipes.	&&&
I love, love, love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes!! They are my go to tool for everyday cleaning.	&&&
"These are just great. I've been using them for many years. A really great non toxic alternative to the cleaning wipes using harmful chemicals.
Cleans well any surface and disinfects."	&&&
"i lov these wipes, they are gret and make my house clean"	&&&
We use these to make our own baby wipes for our wipes warmer. They work great! Also good for travel napkins!	&&&
I love the cleaning feeling when I use Clorox clean up wipes	&&&
"My husband likes the disinfecting properties of these wipes.
They are so easy and convenient. He cannot be without them."	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They make my life so much easier and cleaner.	&&&
I use these as a handkerchief during a cold or flu. The same washable softness and absorbency that's kind to a baby's bottom is also kind to a red, runny, itchy nose. Ordinary handkerchiefs are too stiff for repeated rubbing of an inflamed nose. Since I got these wipes, even a 10-day supercold has not led to the painful soreness I used to get with a cotton handkerchief, or even with the softest available paper tissues (facial or toilet). These cloth wipes are good for a lifetime, not just infancy!	&&&
LOVE THIS! This product is AMAZING!!!! You do not turn orange at all, it gives a nice golden tan. I also bought the lotion, which too is amazing. I've tried all kinds of lotions, wipes, spray tanning, and tanning beds, this is by far the best. I'm a customer for life.	&&&
This product is so convenient and it really does the job. I can grab these and clean a small bathroom in 10 minutes flat!	&&&
Excellent product..having a new baby things can get a little messy..Well the Lemon wipes helps to clean up those messes and has the house smelling fantastic..Definitely recommend to New Parents!	&&&
These are hands down the best chlorine free wipes we have tried. Seventh Generation wipes are much smaller and less moist. Other brands I've had to try when traveling almost always give my baby a rash and I have just not found anything as good as these. The only complaint we have is that some of the wipes don't separate easily- in the heat of a messy moment it can be frustrating. Even with that glitch they are still my favorite.	&&&
I've tried tons of cloth wipes. These are my favorites.	&&&
I love using Clorox products because it is a great disinfectant. The products have a variety of uses from Laundry, bathroom and kitchen cleaning. Clorox products leaves whites whiter and brighter, surfaces spotless and eases the minds of parents wanting a clean house. One of my many favorites (and new favorite) is the Clorox window wipes. Streak free and clean, disinfectant surface.	&&&
"I couldn't have found a better tanner in wipes in my whole life! i have used others they were a streaky nasty mess! They left lines and stuff on my clothes, made my skin oily and nasty but this, after one application i couldn't believe my eyes, now i don't look like a white sheet anymore, i don't have to go tanning or stand in the sun when it hurts, i can just open two of the packs use them and wala tan skin i can use as little or as much as i want! for the best tan without sun and since it is almost completely organic who am i to complain! Now i don't look like a white skinned native american woman i have the tan i always wanted but couldn't get!

""No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!"""	&&&
I frequently set my timer for 10 minutes to do a little speed-cleaning - as I don't enough large blocks of time to tackle what needs to be done. With the ease of use of Clorox Wipes, it is amazing what can be accomplished in such a short period of time.	&&&
Cleans great. been using these wipes for many years.	&&&
Clorox wipes make for the best after meal clean ups with 4 kids under 4 in my household these days idk what I'd do without them!	&&&
I personally love all the Clorox products, they clean so well. The wipes are my favorite because they are so easy to use and clean up all the tough messes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great! Get the job done and always make sure I have some on hand	&&&
I use these wipes to clean the kitchen, bathroom, and pretty much every room in the house. They have a wonderful scent, which you wouldn't expect from such a powerful disinfectant.	&&&
I love having theses in all my bathrooms, kitchen and car, Very easy to use and disinfects and deodorizes. great for all kinds of jobs.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes. Being a busy, on the go mom, these are just so quick and easy to use and make clean up much more enjoyable. Would recommend these to everyone!	&&&
This warms up my cloth wipes well and keeps them moist. Exactly what it's supposed to do and i have 30 cloth wipes in it now.	&&&
Love these Wipes! Use them in every room of the house!	&&&
Love the Clorox Wipes. The only reason it lost a star is I dislike the lemon scent.	&&&
Clorox wipes are an excellent cleaner, disinfector for all cleaning needs. I use in all rooms of my home and never worry if my house is clean. I know it kils the germs lurking in my bathroomn & kitchen, I don't worry about germs on the telephone, cupboards, refrigerator or anywhere I clean with the wipes. They save time. I also take to work to clean my computer station. Wouldn't be without them.	&&&
When choosing disinfecting wipes I always choose Clorox.This is the name I trust to et stains out anywhere in my home.	&&&
Great Product for the value! I would recommend Clorox wipes for all your cleaning projects both at home and work.	&&&
These wipes are great to have around the house. They are useful and I recommend having some wipes handy for everyday use.	&&&
These wipes are great for schools, especially this time of year when there are lots of viruses and germs lurking around. The kids themselves can even assist in cleanup.	&&&
I love Huggies simply clean wipes. It makes cleaning a messy diaper much easier and you dont have to use as many wipes!	&&&
these are the best wipes ive used. My baby really feels good after these and i havent seen any rash or redness. Will continue using	&&&
Clorox wipes are awesome and easy cleaners. Love the ease and strength of product	&&&
These are our favorite wipes BY FAR, especially for the price. The fresh scent is an added bonus.	&&&
"The package comes complete with twenty individually wrapped towelettes. Each one is nice and soft saturated in the special tanning solution. There wasn't a fragrance to this really, just like a typical small of a fragrance free wipe if that makes sense. There was no chemical smells like you see with a lot of the self tanners. To cover my whole body, it took about 4 wipes. I wasn't sure how dry was too dry and etc. I wanted to make sure I did this right. I followed the directions, no shaving 24 hours prior to use :) After application, I didn't notice any skin irritation at all. This was very nice as it was something I worried about. Results are not going to be seen for four hours and even so, you can apply again if you haven't reached the desired result you are looking for.

After four hours, I did see the results I was looking for. My skin has a nice glow to it. Not a red or orange glow, but a nice brown glow. I really loved the results. This was so much easier and cleaner than the other products I had used in the past and they didn't deliver half of the results this did for me. To maintain your tan, it states to re-apply 1-2 times a week. I just did it the once and I still have the same wonderful results. I wish these came in bigger boxes because like I said, I had to use four for one time. With results like these though, I will definitely be ordering more of these."	&&&
I've been super happy with these wipes. They work just as effectively as non-organic alternatives and my baby's skin doesn't react at all. They last a long time for the price, too, so I don't feel like I'm spending much more than I would on regular wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are to me the best!!! they keep Germs away and cleans areas around the house very easily	&&&
I have clorox wipes in every bathroom and the kitchen! I love them!	&&&
I love the huggies wipes	&&&
I love the convenience of the wipes. I use them in cleaning my bathroom. I can easily use them and then discard them easily when finished. No residue and no rinseing needed.	&&&
This product was recommended by a furniture repair man. The wipes are extremely convenient and work very well.	&&&
Clorox wipes are a staple in my household. They are so easy to use and are great at cleaning a variety of messes. I love the peace of mind I get knowing that Clorox wipes really disinfect any surface I use them on.	&&&
Having Clorox wipes is a must have in our house, very convenient and beneficial in kitchen, bathrooms, etc.	&&&
I love the wipes it cleans disinfects and leaves a great after smell	&&&
I really like these wipes as they are so handy. The dispenser is similar to the bleach wipes you get in the grocery store though - not my favorite.	&&&
"I use dry-erase markers are used to keep score and track penalties in youth hockey games. Just wiping the scoreboards clean is not enough. I have found that these wipes do a good job of cleaning the scoreboards completely."	&&&
These wipes are great. I wipe everything down with these. I use these at home, work and even in the car. I am a clean freak and love that these wipe away dirt and germs with all the extra bacteria that's out there during cold and flu season. They're also great for cleaning up when my puppy has a little accident off her puppy pad. They are convenient to keep in your car and/or office. I keep them in the glove compartment and prefer these to car wipes. I have all the others in my office using these to dust around the office."}},	&&&
Tis product is beyond amazing and I will continue to purchase and recommend	&&&
I LOVE these! The abrasive side is perfect for wiping my bathroom vanity and sink area. It removes the hairspray, etc. that settles on the surface. Perfect for the kitchen counter too when there's a spill or something that has somewhat dried. When I found these, I abandoned any other wipes that I was buying.	&&&
These wipes are easy to use and they get the job done!	&&&
Wipes are easy to use, have great cleaning power and fast. Great for wiping down most bathroom & kitchen surfaces. These are a must have in my cleaning arsenal.	&&&
best product ever used feel confident in using this product for my family i feel it is quality product and provides the disinfecting that i need to use in my home	&&&
Absolutely LOVE using Clorox products. (Especially the wipes.) Convenient, easy to use and disinfects!	&&&
Love these wipes for everything. Great with little kids around. Keeps things clean and fresh.	&&&
It works perfectly. Great size for cloth wipes, easy to open and stays open, keeps wipes the perfect temperature, has little light on the front, just great :)	&&&
Unfortunately, these wipes did not agree with my eyes. They stung my eyelids and left them irritated and red. I couldn't apply eyeshadow for a few days after that bc my lids were still sensitive.	&&&
I have little kids so spills happen all the time after I clean up most of it. I come back aroound with a clorox wipe. I like all the scents of this product.	&&&
My favorite product ever for my baby! No residue no harsh chemicals, soft wipes. Will use these forever!! Also, shipping was pretty fast	&&&
This company changed its wipes from wonderful, wet wipes to small, hardly moist ones. I am deeply disappointed. I will not buy again unless they go back to the old ones with the yellow packaging.	&&&
We love these wipes! They are soft yet durable and do not irritate my baby's bottom. Best of all they are cheaper at Target than from The Honest Company.	&&&
Best wipes for a newborn. I trust them to be gentle on my baby's bottom. They even use them in the hospital nccu that says alot.	&&&
Very good product, just wish I could fill w/@ least 1 full wipes refill. Should be able to fit more wipes inside.	&&&
I like these wipes because they are strong and smell great. I like to buy in bulk so I always have them.	&&&
Got a screaming deal of 50%off, which is always good. Good product, nice weight. These are not the individual bag-packs with a flip top though, they're the big, refill bags for your own hard wipes case.	&&&
So I've tried out the Seventh Generation Free & Clear baby wipes on my son and I'm totally in love with the way they make my son bottom clean & soft at the same time..i think he even enjoys the softness of them because he was smiling lol! They even smell good too!..Oh and did I mention I received this for free by testing this out for Generation Good ...so what are you waiting for join too so u can receive awesome products for free too!!	&&&
Best wipes I have tried . Others were not moist enough .	&&&
I love this product!!!! I love that I can have it near my changing table at home or take it on the go and plug it to my car. I love and appreciate that at night when my little one needs a diaper change when I wipe her she feels the nice warmth in the wipes and doesn't wake up screaming out of her sleep. No more cold wipes for my baby's bum bum (until summer weather that is)!!	&&&
These are the only wipes I can use on my little one. I love being able to get them off Amazon.	&&&
There are many more cost-effective and just as effective otherwise, baby wipes on the market. Because of this competition, I do not recommend spending money on Boogie Wipes	&&&
I got my sample of boogie wipes n they came in handy. They didn't rip so easy like the other wipes did.	&&&
Omg! I love these wipes great, Great price. Will purchase more. They do the job.	&&&
These are great when we are looking for an unscented baby wipe. These are the only wipes I trust, and they really get the job done.	&&&
With Pampers wipes I don't have to use an outrageous amount to clean up my child's stools. The wipes are soft and gentle enough to wipe off the mess with no struggle. Fast and clean! My son has a really sensative bottom and after having a horrible horrible diaper rash I switched to all pampers sensative products, He's never had a diaper rash since :)	&&&
Love Clorox wipes!! They smell so good and make everything so clean!	&&&
things things are awsome for every day little messes	&&&
I wish this dispenser held more wipes. Due to its compact size I must refill it often.	&&&
Clorox Wipes are convenient for cleaning when you want to get something really clean really quick.	&&&
We love these wipes. They're sensitive on skin. We never leave home without a pack. They're great for babies and also for cleaning up spills!	&&&
Great price, I purchase these wipes on a regular basis from Amazon!	&&&
These wipes make it easy for kids to help around the house!	&&&
works great------.......will purchase again........"}},	&&&
"First, my husband refuses to use these wipes because they are ""slimy."" I think they are fine wipes, but he is adamant that they are gross and horrible But I'm writing this review, not him. So wipes = ok.

Second, this humongous box of wipes comes with a tub. They all come with a tub. There are 864 wipes in this box. Who buys 864 wipes that doesn't already have a tub? If you weren't ready to make the investment to purchase this crap-ton of wipes, don't you think you'd start with a 1-off tub from the shelf at the old grocery store?
I just want to buy a ton of wipes to wipe the ton of bums that I have to wipe without having to try to think of a way to creatively re-use the crappy plastic box that comes with the wipes."	&&&
Clorox wipes are my favorite. Not only are they convenient but they are great at cleaning and disinfecting	&&&
They are so much easier to use and really seem to work great.	&&&
I bought this wipes for years and loved them. Not anymore. They changed them and not for the better. They are smaller than before, more fragrant but what I really don't like is that now they burn after you wipe. My kids use them too but I have to switch since they also complain that it stings. Going a more natural way...	&&&
These sweat shield wipes are amazing! I have a tendency to sweat under my arms regardless of the temperature. I would sometimes sweat through my shirts and it would make me self conscious for the rest of the day. I use 1 wipe about every week and a half. I apply it at night after showering- its really uncomfortable for about 45 min to an hour, it feels itchy. But it passes and trust me, its worth it! The more you use the pads the less uncomfortable it is. I use deodorant as I normally do each morning but I don't even know if I need to. I would suggest this product to anyone!	&&&
"Clorox wipes are by farthest what I use most to clean my house with. I have a one year old son and it can get pretty messy. It is so much easier to pull one out and wipe away, then dispense. They are also great ""on the go"". I liked this product so much that we use them at work. I work with children and after snack and or lunch it can get sticky. It is much easier to wipe off tables. It is also a good way to help us workers by having the older children wipe off the tables for us because it is that EASY.
Thank you for your product.
Melissa."	&&&
"I love Clorox wipes for ease of use in keeping germs at bay especially in flu season. I used to wipe down work phone, keyboard and mouse in addition to my desk.
Also very convenient for doing quick touch up cleaning of toilet at home.
Best product for the fight in staying flu free."	&&&
I absolutely love the Pampers sensitive wipes! I've tried several other wipes and these are by far the best! They are nice and thick to get the job done. I also like that there are no harsh irritants/fragrances in it. This pack is also a great value!	&&&
Received quickly. Product is as described.	&&&
I love clorox products. My family loves how easy they are to use to clean up little messes.	&&&
Love these wipes!!! Soft to the touch, never fails	&&&
"I bought these wipes and the new Amazon Elements diapers. I have been quite pleased with both products. I hope they bring the new-and-improved diapers back soon.

Prior to buying these wipes, I used Pampers sensitive. The Amazon brand product is a little bit smaller, but they are thicker and have a better texture. I find that on my super messy jobs, I use fewer of these wipes. I really like the texture. It's like little bubbles or pockets of fabric. It adds extra scrubbing power without being rough or abrasive.

My husband hates these wipes. He doesn't like the smell of these wipes. To me, they smell identical to the Pampers wipes. They are also difficult to separate. It can be difficult to get just one out of the wipe warmer. Usually 2 or 3 come out at a time. Since I change the majority of the diapers, my vote counts for more. I say we keep using them.

It doesn't hurt to save a few dollars on the wipes as well. This is a high quality product at a great price."	&&&
My family uses Clorox everything! From wipes, to spray, bathroom cleaners, and bleach! When my husband got sick last year, and could not work for 8 months and had to stay home due to his treatments, my family (kids included) knew how important it was to keep our home as bad germ free as possible. Our kids were the greatest! They helped every day before leaving for school and me going to work, wipe down anything we had touched, remotes, door knobs, light switches, sink handles, fridge...When we came home, we used hand sanitizer, and wiped everything down again after dinner. Long story short, my kids were a great help, and helped keep the kid school germs away from dad! Also, fantastic at removing stains, and makes my sons football jerseys look bright and white again!!	&&&
Great product. easy to grab and use to disinfect an area.	&&&
Can't beat Clorox wipes for ease of use and quick cleaning and disinfecting!	&&&
I love how easy it is to grab a wipe and clean the kitchen cabinet. With 3 kids there's no telling what's on the cabinet, but I know when I use the Clorox wipes I don't need to worry about left over germs.	&&&
These are the best wipes I have ever used. They have a good smell and they last a long time. I love them	&&&
Maybe its just me..but its is really uncomfortable to put on, the wipes roll up you can't really put it on evenly because there is no tent to the wipes, I guess I just prefer lotion.	&&&
"Have been buying this now for 3 month and I'm very happy with it.
It comes in a variety of packages so you get the full box and the fill ups too and the are really good and thicker wipes then usual."	&&&
Love these wipes!!! They are very convenient and easy to use. Great value for this product!	&&&
I have to admit, I have lazy teenagers! Those lazy teenagers love to leave messes and hate to clean up after themselves. With the Clorox wipes, all they need to do is grab a wipe and in one swift movement they have cleaned up their mess while disinfecting. Its a great product that I cannot live without!	&&&
I have these in every bathroom of my house. With three little boys, the toilet needs to be FREQUENTLY wiped down. I feel much better knowing that I've not only cleaned, but also disinfected the bathroom when I use these wipes!!	&&&
I love these wipes. They are quick easy and smell amazing!!	&&&
An absolute necessity for the workplace. I had the flu this season, and in my absence, my coworkers cleaned my desk with Clorox wipes......and no one else was sick. Being sick is one thing, but knowing you gave it to someone else makes you feel even worse. Thank you for helping me keep my germs to myself!	&&&
Love these wipes. Leaves a nice shine on wood furniture.	&&&
They don't irritate my baby's bottom, and they aren't soaked like other brands.	&&&
Great quality product, wipes are very moist and durable. Good value for price paid. Would order again and recommend to friends.	&&&
I have used these wipes for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, especially since menopause where the skin in that region is much dryer than it used to be...that being said, these wipes offer a clean, non-irritating, convenient way to spiff up when you need it. I buy multiple packs at a time and they have not dried out on me if you close the package right. I always have them on hand, take them with me when traveling, have a package in my desk at work and generally feel comfortable using them for a quick refresh. I love that they are all cotton. I went to a gynecological vulvar specialist years ago and she recommended them to me. Who knew that other pads, tampons, wipes have so many chemicals in them, including BLEACH, which I am very allergic to. Those other products were BURNING my vulva, so this is all I use and I LOVE them. Won't be without them!	&&&
i love these wipes so much. i have found them to be the softest wipes to use on my babys bottom. im definitely a commited customer!!!	&&&
"Product was good just didn't hold enough wipes for me"	&&&
These wipes are great they don't dry out and they also keep their smell.This size pack is easy to take everywhere	&&&
Use everyday	&&&
"The wipes are okay ..but they aren't folded together so they can feed out of the package .
It's very difficult to get them out!"	&&&
I always buy the Huggies sensitive wipes. My baby has very sensitive skin and he would still break out. My friend told me about the kandoo wipes how the work for her baby so I decided to try then out. Absolutely one of the best wipes out there. I recommend everyone should try this.	&&&
My little one is very sensitive to fragrances and scents. These wipes are fragrance free and very gentle! These wipes are also very strong so you don't need to use as many as you would with a different brand . I love that they are safe and free from chemicals as well! I received this product as a free sample but this is a true review of how I feel about the product.	&&&
My daughter has very sensitive skin so I whole heartedly prefer these wipes. Especially because of how durable and soft they are. They do cost a little more than store brands but they are worth every penny.	&&&
What more can I say but that these wipes are the best thing I have used in ages. As a great grandma, believe me, I have gone through lots of wipes, but these are gentle, easy to use and truly do help keep the little ones clean without worry. Convenient size - fits in my purse or back-pack easily. Take them where ever we go.	&&&
This is a great product. Like the size of the wipes and it's a great little package that they come in. The most obvious use is to wipe your face your kids face or baby's bottom but I've also used them to take spilled food or dirt spots off clothing. Worked great without water spotting the clothes. Ingredients in them are fantastic and good for skin. Keep them all over my house and in my cars.	&&&
I used this on my bg's gums, then she grew a set of teeth at the early age of 3 months. putting my finger in her mouth now is a bit dangerous.	&&&
The wipes work ok. They have left some redness but my daughter has not said that they hurt. She is two. The smell however is extremely strong. They smell like men's cologne. It is not a horrible smell it is just very strong, and not the baby scent. I tend to buy unscented but I needed some fairly quick. These were a decent price, however I will not be buying them again.	&&&
Have a 15 lb rescue puppy and love using this as they stay snug and don't move. They also do not prohibit him from moving and playing as a puppy would. Peace of mind when I can't keep my eye on him 100%.	&&&
The wipes are just perfect for before bed freshening. Can also use them to clean my hands.	&&&
Pampers wipes are ever softer than any other wipes,,, moreover my baby n me love it's scent,,,	&&&
very good and convenient product	&&&
I love that huggies has a good variety in their wipes selection, and the scents that are available. However, I absolutely hate how everytime I go to pull a wipe out of the container or the warmer that I own, they TEAR! So frustrating.."	&&&
Wonderful product. Refreshing and gentle, easy to use.	&&&
This leaves a fresh feeling. Strong enough to clean and not fall apart. and gentle enough to soothe and freshen the most delicate parts.	&&&
I have been using these wipes for 2 years now, and have yet to find one thing wrong with them! They smell amazing and work the best! I highly recommend these for all mothers! Especially mothers with kids/babies with sensitive skin!"	&&&
Wipes work well. Would need multiple (2-3) for bigger poops but alot less than other brands	&&&
Great product - people at work liked them so much I bought a few boxes for staff. Worth the price if you can't see so good	&&&
Works great! More comfortable and gentle on your baby.	&&&
Fantastic product! Our daughter is 5 and we still use these for messy situations and/or potty time. I would recommend to any parent looking for a fantastic product!	&&&
I love clorox wipes! I have a container in my kitchen and in both bathrooms. I feel like when I use Clorox disinfecting wipes my counters, door knobs, tables and anything else we touch is clean and germ free! I like all the scents, they do not smell strong, they actually smell clean and not overwhelming. I also like how easy they are to use, just pull and wipe! It's easy to do a quick wipe down in the morning and any other time I feel like I need to wipe down things in my house.	&&&
These wipes are thick, they absorb easily and you don't have to use as many wipes!	&&&
I love the quality and price this product is the best ive tried so far this wipes arent so wet so when I clean it does remove with just using 2 or 3 wipes that does all the work	&&&
The disinfecting wipes works well on cleaning the stove. I use it every time I need to clean my stove from grease.	&&&
The Clorox wipes work great and are quick and easy to use! The lemon scent is our fave!	&&&
I've used Clorox wipes on stains and grease. The stains comes off very easy. I'm a huge fan!	&&&
We have tried several brands of wipes and we always come back to Huggies Wipes. We use less the amount if wipes and he never breaks out in a rash. Wonderful Wonderful product!	&&&
"I bought these wipes to clean out my computer desk since is a dust magnet. These wipes got the job done. It got rid of all dust and even the black marks that could only be seen when wiped off, making my computer desk sparkly clean. It also smells really nice, unlike the chlorine smell that many other wipes have. I rate this highly!"	&&&
Nothing good as top of the line butt wipes. The others fall apart or are as thin as paper. These are quilted, so you use less & cover more bumm territory.	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox wipes. They make cleaning the kitchen so much easier!!! They remove grease so quickly and easily. I've tried other brands and they don't come close to cleaning and disinfecting as well as the Clorox wipes.	&&&
My wife and I use these wipes more than paper towels. These wipes are so very convenient and useful for so many things. And makes the task much easier to complete compared to spraying and wiping down. With growing kids that don't always listen to Mom and Dad to wash their hands...there's a shocker...these wipes make quick work of cleaning up their mess. Also sanitizing things we all touch...light switches, door handles, toilet levers, faucets, door casings, and the occasional pet mess. Love these wipes and highly recommend them to all.	&&&
Clorox wipes do a great job in cleaning up little ones spills!	&&&
i love my clorox wipes. i feel it the only thing that cleans well and disinfects	&&&
I live in a city and like to wipe my dog's paws after she comes into the apartment from being outside. I have tried several other brands of wipes and with all of them she licked and bit at her paws. These wipes are great. Perfect amount of moisture, no smell and best of all they don't seem to bother my dog's skin. Clean house for me and no irritation for my dog. Perfect!	&&&
I love this stuff! Gets everything clean and smells good too.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes for quick, easy clean up in my kitchen and bathrooms. These are also a great way to get my kids helping with cleaning.	&&&
I've always liked these wipes as they typically get most of my make-up off. I wear Mac studio fix and it takes about 2 wipes to wipe off. My eye make-up is a different story. No matter how hard I wipe, I always find clunks of mascara, so I also wash my face after using this and it seems to be working. For the price, I think it's a good deal.	&&&
Oh my, these smell fantastic! The cucumber melon scent is wonderful. The wipes are thicker like Huggies and are very soft and durable. With two babies now, durable large wipes are a must and these are perfect. They are definitely not dry at all. The flip lid is also very secure so I do not have to worry about tossing one in a bag and worry about it opening and drying out or a little one opening it.	&&&
I use these wipes all the time, not just when I'm on my period. They make me feel clean and the light scent reassures me that I won't smell gross. I love that they come in a little box that keeps them moist and fresh.	&&&
They are my savior. I have them in every room and bathroom in my house. easy to se. quick. I love them	&&&
Best Wipes- Great Value. This box lasts us several months!	&&&
The Lysol wipes is good product to use to do touch up around your house. However, they are a little small. I would say they too small for men to use but okay for women and children. They are also thin. I strongly recommend using two or three at a time because they are so thin. Watch out for using them too often on bathroom counter tops because they are strong. Also the lemon and lime scents will eventually turn your countertops yellow. Other then that great product for touch up in between full cleaning of faucets, countertops and toilets."}},	&&&
There's a reason this is the #1 selling diaper wipe. We still use Luvs Diapers, but Pampers really nailed it with the wipes. Best wipe out there, and thanks to Subscribe and Save, it shows up on my doorstep and goes straight to the baby's room. There's a reason that this is listed as the preferred choice for Hospitals, too. That's a lot of newborn bottoms to test against, and this is the wipe that comes out the safest, and most effective.	&&&
"pamper wipes are better than huggies
huggies diapers for better than pampers"	&&&
i like to use cleaning wipes when in a jiffy i have to clean up a mess that i don't have time to actually wash a wash rag for and i don't have to worry about going back and disinfecting wash rag and washing because they are disposable.	&&&
I use the clorox wipes to clean up just about anything. Easy to you, convenient and I trust they are doing there job to disinfect!	&&&
These wipes make it very easy to wipe down the bike after a wet or dirty run. I usually use 2 of them. They do not irritate my hands at all. Easy to get any grease off and the bike is nice and shinny. Now I can avoid full washes, just wipe it down.	&&&
"Excellent product. My kids are very skin sensitive and we don't like anything that is ""perfume-y"". These were on sale, so we thought we would try them out. We didn't have any problems with these on our children. We've noticed everything that is ""fragrance free"" still has a bit of a perfume-y fragrance...this one is not overly perfume-y. We typically use the Pampers, but I'll go with whatever is cheaper in this case.

The only down side of these is they do tend to leave fibers behind if you use them on kids faces that very sticky or on faces that have a little bit of facial hair. Yes, we use wipes for a lot of things. They are great for a quick wipe up for lots of things. We use them in the car when we travel to wash sticky hands or dirty faces when there isn't a bathroom or sink around to wash up.

Overall, very pleased."	&&&
Love these wipes. Great deal!!	&&&
I received this product for free and in my own words, I was really impressed with the quality of these wipes! I really love how well it cleans my son, it's safe for him & the environment, plus its great for sensitive skin and has a nice clean smell.	&&&
I know I can depend on these wipes they absorb well and get the job done I got these for a honest review for free !!	&&&
I bought these wipes for my granddaughters constantly dirty hands. When I started using them, I found that they were as dry as an ancient bone. I thought to myself, How old were the things?	&&&
"I like this wipes. my skin is very sensitive and i have observed in past that using makeup wipes used to make my skin red. i used this one and there was no redness in my skin. i loved this. i will continue using these wipes in future. its texture is soft and has a very preeety fragrance.
I was given this product at a reduced rate for an honest opinion"	&&&
I like these wipes for a quick clean up. They are great for the bathroom and kitchen. Good disinfecting power. I just wish the wipes were a bit larger. If they were a little larger I would use less at one time. They are good for a quick wipe of the bathroom, kitchen counter and table. Not really for heavy cleaning. Scent is not overpowering.	&&&
I love the natural wipes.	&&&
I bought this product becasue my sons nose constantly leaks. The normal tissue or wipe usually makes his nose raw after a couple wipes especially in the cooler weather. We love these wipes and havent had a problem yet!	&&&
Sturdy wipes without the heavy scent. No problems whatsoever	&&&
Only wipes I will use. Very little ingredients and no rash issues. The thick wipes we cannot use since the ingredients are different and caused a rash.	&&&
I received a sample of these wipes before buying them. They are by far the best wipes for cleaning your little ones nose. I also use them. They feel better than ordinary baby wipes and I like that they have saline. Love this product!	&&&
I was actually ready to blast these, despite the fact that they work so well. They said they didn't contain alcohol then I saw on the ingredients list that they have cetearyl alcohol. I looked it up and learned that that is one of three fatty alcohols often included in organic skin products. It is actually an emollient and not drying. These wiped have an exfoliating side with little beads and a softer side. They are not sopping wet and not to dry. I really, really like them. They will replace my neutrogena wipes. I received these at a discount in exchange for a review. I will repurchase at full price. They're a little pricier, but worth it for me because they feel like they don't leave my skin feeling like I need to rinse it to get rid of the ingredients from the actual cleansing cloth. And I really like that they aren't scented. If you don't want to spend the extra few dollars, the Neutrogena wipes clean just as well. I just personally like these ones a lot better.	&&&
I received seventh generation wipes as a free trial from the company and I must say these are amazing wipes! I was skeptical I wouldn't like them, because most green products have not so pleasant scents. Well they proved me wrong these wipes are unscented, gentle and perfect of sensitive skin! If your baby has a sensitive toosh these wipes are definitely for you or if you just want to get away from all the chemicals other companies use. Our babies deserve the best so why not star t by caring for their skin with seventh generation's chemical free products. Try it you'll love it!	&&&
Gotta agree with the other reviewers who said this burned the heck outta their eyes.	&&&
This is another great products of their stuffs. I have all pampers for all my baby.	&&&
This is taking the edge off my itch and making it a bit more tolerable, but it's not giving my the relief that I was hoping for. It's great that it's not a steroid, though	&&&
Came as described and worked perfectly. I would recommend to anyone looking to clean up their homes quickly and easily.	&&&
I have a Maltese that is not house trained. These are the perfect size and have Velcro like tabs that can be used over and over. Very absorbent and have a dry liner so he doesn't get irritated from his urine. Also has a protective plastic outer to prevent leaks. Would have given 5 stars except for the cost. A bit expensive.	&&&
Excellent product although the price is not as good as the BJs brand, which is also very good. Overrall, I'd recommend it, especially for newborns-8 months, where they are the most sensitive.	&&&
seventh generation baby wipes very general to us on a baby are yourself I will be buying seventh generation baby wipes	&&&
Personal preference but I prefer this style of wipes where it's not as slimy as the pampers sensitive wipes we use normally. It does rip and break easily like toilet paper, that seems like it would be better for biodegradable purposes but it allows for a better grip and wipe	&&&
Boogie Wipes are excellent to have when I take out my great-granddaughters! They are not only great for runny noses, but they are good to have for wiping tiny hands!	&&&
My little girl had such a sore nose, these wipes were gentle and effective!	&&&
I used the original wipes for over a year with my first child. The new wipes, however, are dry and useless. I need to use at least 2 new wipes to one original wipe for a soiled diaper. Now I'm going through a pack like gangbusters. While the original formula had some problems: wipes never separated properly and you could never use the yellow package for more than two or three changes before the plastic tape wore off, the new changes are bad. I could deal with packaging issues, but not problems with the wipes themselves. Now I'm looking for new wipes.	&&&
Very few wipes!!!!! Watch the description!	&&&
"These are great for quick cleanups, everywhere in the house. Unlike some bargain brands, the wipes are large and have plenty of cleaning solution. And they smell great, too. I would definitely recommend them, and would buy them again."	&&&
These wipes are pleated and not as thick as others which makes them very nice.	&&&
I hate to be wasteful so these disinfecting wipes are great. They are easy to grab when both of my children make a big mess. The only con would be that they are not very absorbent so if you are cleaning up a liquid mess, you have to use paper towels first.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes! I use them for everything! Definitely a staple in my house!	&&&
Wow, I have to say that these were probably the worst glass wipes I have ever used. Not only did they NOT clean glass, they left horrible, sticky streaks. Clorox needs to stick to bleach1	&&&
I definitely am happy with this purchase and would recommend this EXCELLENT product to anyone. Definitely high quality wipes. This is MY review and to those who feel that this isn't quite what they wanted to hear, then frankly I could care less….. MOVE ON…..	&&&
Bleach = clean and disinfected! Nothing works better than Clorox. The wipes I use in between those disinfecting days as it is simple and does quite a good job.	&&&
"I bought this product because I have been experimenting with tanners because my daughter is a competition dancer and I am not wanting to have to pay for a spray tan twice a month. I have tried lotion, mousse and wipes of different brands. THIS tanner is awesome. With most tanners you have to wait up to 1 hour before it dries and you can get dressed. This one takes less than 10 minutes and you are good to go. I didn't notice anything that night but the next day (which is always the day we look for streaks) she had a very nice glow to her skin and no streaks. One application is sufficient for the color we need for competition and it much less time than other tanners. The test: she went to dance practice two days after the application and everyone was like “wow who did your tan?” I say we found a winner !!!!!

Next was my turn. I very fair freckled skin. I only did my legs because I was afraid they would not look natural boy was I wrong they looked great. It was just enough color to give it a healthy glow. Here in Florida even in the summer I never tan but I am looking forward to being as tan as everyone else this summer with these wipes."	&&&
I have lots of boys and I use clorox wipes on the toilet every day. I love them. Thanks!	&&&
I got these wipes as a sample with my order. I used them on my face and shoulders and had my boyfriend use them on my back. I must say that these scrub like a sugar scrub and leave your skin feeling smooth and fresh. The non-exfoliation side is smooth and comforting to your skin. I also used these on my boyfriend and he loved them. Already purchasing more.	&&&
We use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in our kitchen on a daily basis. They are so convenient to wipe down surfaces after preparing food, and we can rest assured knowing the counters are completely disinfected. The ONLY downside is the price - but it's worth it for the convenience!	&&&
These wipes don't rip apart like others do.... So gentle and soft !	&&&
they are the best for wiping away little finger prints	&&&
Just right for bedside wipes. Even if one doesn't have a baby!	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes! Couldn't imagine cleaning without them!	&&&
I could not live without my Clorox Wipes!! I am a germaphobic and work in healthcare! I love to be able to pop one out and wipe everything down!	&&&
"I love these wipes! The saline really does the trick to wipe noses clean, even the stubborn, dried up boogies. They smell great and are soft on my baby's skin."	&&&
These are great wipes to keep right there at the toilet. Our little loves to be able to get her own wipe out and greatly helped with Potty Training. They clean well and smell great.	&&&
I make my sons baby food and I love using the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for the counters. I also have my nieces and nephew over often. They love to play with my son's toys. Its so easy to clean the toys after they leave to help prevent the spread of germs.	&&&
I purchase these wipes because they are an easy way to clean. I have a 1 year old and it is very cinvenient.	&&&
Clorox wipes are so convenient and a quick way to sanitize surfaces.	&&&
Love, love, love these wipes! They remove eye makeup easily with absolutely no mess! Easy to pack or keep at home. Moist but soaking wet and not a lot of harsh ingredients. Inexpensive and you get 2 packs!	&&&
Love Love Love these wipes!! We use them to clean everything in our house full of children.	&&&
With two boys under 3, our house can get messy. I like using clorox wipes, because they are easy. Wiping at something one handed is alot easier then spraying cleaner, then scrubbing at the offending mess.	&&&
Love those wipes!!! Great for everyday and everyday mess!!"}}];	&&&
I actually prefer these wipes over any other I have previously used. They don't leave my skin oily and seem to clean well. However, the smell of these is so strong that it burns my eyes and I can't open them until my face has dried or I rinse it off. I do wear contacts, but I am not typically sensitive to any products, and it burns even if I take them out first. I also tried some from a friend, thinking the package I bought was just overloaded, but I experienced the same thing.&#x a;These are one of the first wipes that have worked for my oily skin and not made me break out, but I can't handle the burning, so I'll keep looking.	&&&
I personally use Clorox wipes for everything! Wiping off the counters in the kitchen and using the toilet bowl cleaner in the bathroom. It always smells amazing and fresh after I use a Clorox product.	&&&
Love Pampers and their sensitive wipes! Not harsh on the skin. Never caused any irration for my toddler.	&&&
"Anyone who says it gave their child a yeast infection, rash or that their wipes dried out is not using it properly. Also, it fits more than just Pampers. Maybe the other user didn't have the wipes flipped in the correct direction. My favorite wipes to use with this are Publix brand.

The antimicrobial pad that goes in the bottom would prevent a yeast infection, no bacteria gathers. Everything gets soaked into it. Don't let the pad get dry or else you're better off not having one in there to begin with. Once a week I rinse out the pad and put it back in. Absolutely no issues.

The only thing I would want them to work out is the displacement of heat.

I picked this out because when I start cloth wipes I can just roll them up and insert. Right now I'm using DIY disposable wipes made with Viva Paper Towels. They dispense just fine."	&&&
As a teacher, these handy wipes are great for cleaning up desks and tables quickly!	&&&
"I love using Clorox wipes. Its nice to use to wash the table or the conor tops. Kids like to help cleaning the doors knobs in the house. Thanks
Rochelle"	&&&
The best wipes to clean kitchen and bath I use it in the office as well as home	&&&
As a family with two little ones, I cannot tell you how often we are using the clorox wipes. The convenience of quickly taking out a wipe to clean up a quick mess is understated!	&&&

the best butt wipes money can buy	&&&
love this product. the cleaning wipes work perfect for wiping down counter tops and office desk. i love the different scents as well.	&&&
"Really like the Seventh Generation wipes, but I must have misread this one and ordered the wrong ones - they have a thick wipe that I love. Bought a case of these because they were on sale and oops, they really are too thin for some diapers. They do the trick and clean well enough, but it feels like I have to use more wipes to clean up."	&&&
I love Clorox products and the wipes are so easy to use!	&&&
CAN NOT GET THE WIPES OUT RETURNING.	&&&
i love these wipes. i must have them on every floor in my house. with three kids, there are always messes to be cleaned and disinfected. these wipes make it so easy.	&&&

Clorox wipes are my go to product for all messes big or small.	&&&
Love how this smells so light and kills more germs than other wipes. It does leave a cloudy residue behind, but not a huge issue.	&&&

I love all Clorox products. To me my home doesn't feel clean unless I am cleaning with Clorox bleach, I have 2 kids of my own and watch 3 extra little ones. By the end of the day every surface of my home is a sticky filthy mess. Clorox wipes are easy and quick clean up for a busy mom like me.	&&&
Looked months for Individually Wrapped Wipes at various Retail Outlets. Finally Found them online. Are Exactly what I need. Delivery was Fast and Price was Good. Only WIsh they Came Un-Cented. A minor issue for sure, but just saying.	&&&
these are the best wipes, hands down.	&&&
love that i can clean and disinfect with the same item	&&&
"love these clorox wipes. Lazy person's way to clean anything - even floors - just run it under your shoes! I keep several in the office"	&&&
Don't like these wipes at all. We usually use Pampers Sensitive Wipes (which I am happy with), but I couldn't find them on Amazon when I needed to get more wipes so I got these instead.They have a nice scent (although I'd prefer no scent in my wipes), but they are so thin and awkward to wipe with! I feel like I can't get a good grip to wipe properly and they are so thin I feel like I am getting poop all over my hand (though I am not - it's just an uncomfortable feeling as I am used to thicker wipes). I will not be ordering this kind again.	&&&
"I was offered this item at a reduced price for my honest opinion, please note, I save the 5 stars for the items I love.

I LOVE the idea of these wipes!

I am so excited to get them and try them! I will be starting them tomorrow. I will update after a few days"	&&&
These are the worst wipes ever they are rough and hardly wet at all. How are you supposed to clean a baby with dry scratchy wipes.	&&&
I use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to clean just about everything in my house from kitchen counters to walls to toilet seats. With the convenient containers I can store them in every room for quick, easy clean-ups whenever needed.	&&&
These wipes are thin, but strong. They are my favorite wipes because they don't have added fragrance. My husband hates them because he says they smell like apples. They kind of do, but it doesn't bother me and you get used to it. They could smell a lot worse!	&&&
Best part about these wipes, they are nice and thick! which is different than most wipes.	&&&
"the best wipes ever"	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for every mess around the house. I have even used to clean crayon/marker off the walls.	&&&
I like how convenient it is to have them in all of my bathrooms and kitchen for easy cleaning. My bathrooms always look clean because of the ease of the wipes,	&&&
Great product, have been using since my daughter was born. Only down fall to product is the box you can put refill wipes in. Other then the box, wipes are great	&&&
Love the wipes. You can use them all over the house and they are great for disinfecting!	&&&
I have use pamper wipes for years with my own children throughout the years and now having grandchildren to help raise I'm planning own continuing the same tradition with them also	&&&
I love the feel of these bumpy beaded wipes. They did a good job of taking off most of my eye make up after the day was over. I do usually see more make up on a wipe so I felt like maybe it didn't pull all the make up off as some of the other wipes I've used would do. However, I did enjoy the feel of these so much that I found myself spending a good amount of time going over my eye area and face also. I think they are kinda expensive for what they are even though I got them at discount for my honest review.	&&&
I received these free through seventh generation so my opinion is my own. I love knowing that there is nothing in there that is bad for my baby. Wipes aren't just used for bottoms. I use them for her face, her hands and her little mouth. Knowing I can use them on her sensitive skin with no worries is great!	&&&
Fast shipping, and good pricing. I use the wipes to clean many surfaces, and remove grease residue around the house.	&&&
"My husband and I love to have these wipes handy when we are at a restaurant, store or anywhere away from home. Our son loves to drop his pacifier all over the place. These wipes are a quick & convenient way to clean off some germs."	&&&
I do like these wipes, it takes off all my makeup but they are a little thin, but all in all they're good quality wipes.	&&&
I can't think of a better value. The subscribe and save is such a time saver. The best wipes by far. I used these wipes my three children and never had any kind of skin reaction.	&&&
Why did these wipes have to change? They were the only ones that didn't give my daughter a diaper rash - once we got the new packaging, despite reading that the formula of the wipes didn't change, her rash is back with a vengeance. Very disappointed. Switching brands - strongly encourage you to switch back to the old formula. There's a reason why people buy certain "safer" products and it's not just because they don't want the nasty chemicals - it's also because kids can't always handle the nasty stuff and actually have a reaction to it. Ugh.	&&&
These are great for little noses during cold season or allergy season. Wipes cleanly without getting baby wipe smell on them. Also helps keep from getting sore noses.	&&&
I love johnson's wipes. Smells good. Good amount of moisture. Good texture.	&&&
only wipes my sons skin can handle. they're very soft and no annoying scent	&&&
These wipes are the BEST! They are comparable in quality to the more expensive brands, but the price is RIGHT! They are sensitive enough for my children, both of whom react from harsh products. They are strong and durable. They don't fall apart, come out of the package easily when diapering one-handed (with other wipes, several often come out at a time or they get stuck together), and the quality is good. I use them for spills on clothing, and they don't leave a residue. Great great product!	&&&
We love the baby fresh wipes! They are so soft and gentle on my daughters bottom and face! They smell nice and fresh cleaning up pop very well! I even use them for me! I recommend these to every mom! I do wish they were a little cheaper	&&&
great products, prevents wipes from drying out. love it.	&&&
"At first I will say that I didn't understand why you would buy this product instead of just using tissues. But then I decided to purchase these wipes to try them for myself since I had a sick toddler who has a steady runny nose. And I'm glad I did. These wipes were super gentle to his little nose and made it easier for me to wipe his nose as well. they do a great job of cleaning his face properly without leaving a trail of mucus behind on his face. They leave my sons face clean with a nice smell. I understand that this may be extra to some people. But it is a small price to pay to make sure your child is clean and properly sanitized, especially if you are on the go."	&&&
Love Huggies wipes, refuse to go back to pampers. They are nice and thick and not sopping wet. The only thing g I trust on my son and the scent is light and refreshing.	&&&
I love that there are no chemicals and leaves skin soft without drying. Convenient package to carry in purse too.	&&&
Wipes packed so tight They they tore as you pulled them out. Very thin, and that's the idea, I guess, to make them biodegradable. 5 times the price of regular Baby Wipes. Not a good value nor a well engineered product or package	&&&
I got this product over the weekend. It does a wonderful job cleaning little noses. I had a baby in September and she has been congested. These wipes work great in helping her be able to breathe easier. I love that they come in unscented because newborns can be sensitive to smells. Kudos to you Boogie Wipes!	&&&
I've been using these wipes for 6 years. Sensitive on my kid's skin and they don't have a fragrance which I appreciate.	&&&
I hate buying a billion wipes for all their different purposes, but when our noses are overly dry or overly runny...it's worth it.The pleasant scent and gentleness of these wipes causes my daughter to actually allow me to wipe her nose. I like to use them on myself as well;)	&&&
Love the wipes to clean up greasy messes on the kitchen!	&&&
I love the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. They are so convenient but so powerful as well.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes constantly in the kitchen. They are very convenient and I feel at ease knowing counters, stove, sink and more are being disinfected!	&&&
love these wipes, however I am unhappy that these do not have the pop top tabs, which is why I purchased this	&&&
Clorox wipes are a great product and are perfect for a fast clean up. I use them daily to wipe the sink and toilet to keep the bathroom clean.	&&&
Lasted about a week before it wouldn't close anymore and the wipes would get cold. I had to use a wipe to jam the door so it would close.	&&&
These are the best wipes on the market, and I've tried lots of brands. Stay moist in a warmer, chlorine free, no scent.	&&&
THESE WIPES ARE THE BEST!!! I USE THEM IN EVERY ROOM IN MY HOUSE, NOT ONLY ARE THEY EASY TO USE BUT THE DISINFECT AS WELL!!!	&&&
"These definitely will give you a tan. I thought I would be able to see the stuff when I applied it on my skin but you do not. It goes on invisible. About four hours or so later and then you can see the new color of your skin. I would not recommend using this on your face because I think it would be too hard to not to get noticeable tan lines and you could end up looking quite silly. I used these on my legs. I only used it twice and then I had the color I wanted. The only thing that is a bummer is I cannot see the product spreading on my skin, so it is easy to get some uneven color. For example, I wiped this thoroughly all over my legs but for some reason the back of my legs had areas that did not look tan. There were white areas. I don't know how that happens though since I wiped everywhere as evenly as I possibly could. It was not a big deal though because I was not that tan which made it not that noticeable.

It takes some practice to get used to using these and to discover the color you want. After waiting four or more hours and you still want to be tanner, just grab another wipe and wipe on the area. Be careful to not put too much around your ankles, knees, or elbows or it will look funny. Also, wash your hands immediately after using the wipe. You probably should scrub them. I washed after using them but probably not well enough and my palms were brown the next day. I like how easy it was to use these wipes without any real work. You should probably exfoliate your skin as much as possible before using this product, though. I'm not sure how long this product is supposed to last with showers and shaving. I will find out soon enough, though. The instructions did not tell me. Once you find the color you like you should only have to use a wipe one or two times a week. You may need to play around to see how frequently you will need to reapply. Fortunately, this box comes with 20 and I found that two wipes gives me the color I want. I will continue to use these because I do like the color it gives me and it was easy to use. With practice and patience, I think I have figured out to get a nice tan with these. It does not take long at all because you’re just wiping a pre-moistened wipe on the area you want to tan. Make sure you wait until you see the tan before using a second wipe. Try to make it as even as possible. That is where it took a little practice with me. I think this is a great product for giving me a quick tan. I like the results. I received a discount on this product through a promotion. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product"	&&&
Love your products and have been using them for years. Thanks for helping keep my family clean and disinfected for years!	&&&
I love leaving the Clorox Wipes go packs in each bathroom. After the kids brush their teeth or the counter gets messy as it typically does daily, they are a convenient, nice way to clean the vanity in a quick minute.	&&&
These are the only disinfecting wipes we buy. I've tried other brands and just don't like them.	&&&
5 STARS! â?...â?...â?...â?...â?... GRADE A+ FLUSH-ABLE WIPES. NEVER CLOGS THE TOILET! FANTASTIC WIPES!	&&&
Convenient wipes for all locations. Not only use it at home but at the office too. Proper way of preventing germs to avoid colds and flu.	&&&
Cant say enough about wipes, use them in the car, at home, at work, everywhere! Would highly recommend them to all.	&&&
With two little ones potty training messes are going to happen and disinfectant wipes are a must ;)	&&&
We use Clorox Wipes to clean everything. They work great and are much faster than spray and paper towels. We especially love the coverage area we get during cold and flu season.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are a must if you want the proper tools to clean, freshen, and disinfect your kitchen. They clean food spills, greasy stains, dust and almost anything that gets in the way from having a clean kitchen.	&&&
I love the wipes I use them for everything from cleaning the bathroom to wiping down walls.	&&&
So easy to use and I use them on everything!! I prefer the Clorox wipes over other brands and store brands!	&&&
Been using clorox wipes for nearly 10 years now. the best. period.	&&&
Good wipes they may cost more but they work better than the other wipes you buy at the drugstore.	&&&
The fresh scent is our favorite smell! These wipes truly help keep little noses from getting chapped & red and they really work! The wipes keep noses nice & clean. Love them!!	&&&
"I love these so much! It just makes all the wipes I used previously pale in comparison. The package nice and easy to open, and doesn't take up much space. These wipes are a bit bigger than the different products I have used before which is nice. They feel great against the skin, and my skin thanks Dude Wipes.

Side note: Just make sure to tug lightly when you pull them out of the package. This way you will avoid having them tear on you. So don't be a hasty pooper, and just stay relaxed through your bathroom vacation!"	&&&
These wipes are very thick and don't have a perfume smell like several other wipes we have tried	&&&
WHY DID YOU CHANGE THEM? These wipes used to be so thick and reliable. You could get the job done with only a few. Now they are flimsy and like all other, cheaper wipes. I will cancel my Amazon subscription and I will be switching back to the regular wipes.	&&&
Boogie Wipes, although designed for kids, are a product that are also wonderful for adults. I bought a pack for my daughter when she had a cold. But then I realized that they might work well for me. I think I have sinus problems. It seems like my nose is always dripping! (Gross!) Then it gets dry and sore from wiping. Boogie Wipes proved to be the perfect solution- soothing and gentle! No more red nose problems!	&&&
"I absolutely love these wipes! I had been using mostly the Huggies Simply Clean ones but would find that they sometimes irritated my son's bottom. I ordered these hoping for better results and I got them.
First off the price is great, especially considering I dont have to go out to the store with my 2 kids. I can just have these shipped to my door.
Second these wipes have not given me a problem sticking together when put into the container. Some wipes I have had to really pull to separate them.
Third these were very gentle on my son's skin and caused no irritation.
Fourth I found these to be nice and sturdy, even when using them on a huge poop diaper or to clean up messes.
Thank you Huggies for such a great wipe!"	&&&
They are gentle and clean wonderfully. I wouldn't use anything else on my sons bottom	&&&
We make sure and keep this in the car & at home! It's amazing how much better it gets off "the crusties" from my boys' noses as compared to regular wipes.	&&&
The wipes are great. They are strong and the aroma is there but very slight. They clean perfectly. My grand daughters 3 and 2 years old love them and I love the quality and the price. I flush them and have no problems. I recommend them 100% to anyone!!	&&&
"These are the BEST flushable wipes I have ever used. No irritation after use, and I have very sensitive skin. Also, I love that it is discrete so I can take it with me everywhere including TSA with no weird looks. I only use these for my sexy bum.

I have had some sit in my car for an entire year in 100 degree weather, and they were still perfectly moist after all that time! Amazing! I always keep some in the car and take them with me when camping, traveling or festivals (nasty porta potty with no toilet paper sometimes!)."	&&&
My son loves these wipes. They are gentle and work perfectly! He enjoys wiping his nose with boogie wipes. I'd recommend these to any new mom.	&&&
I have sensitive skin so I have to be very careful about the products I use. These are non-irritating, are just wet enough and do a great job of removing makeup. My only criticism would be that the packaging could be better = the top part that you open to obtain the wipes shreds easily. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I highly recommend.	&&&
"These wipes are the BEST! We keep them in the car, in my purse, and at work.
They are great for that quick wipe down of the cart handle at the grocery store, great for cleaning your hands after you leave the grocery store, wiping down the steering wheel, your phones (at home or office) and door handles!
We have used these for years and will continue to use them."	&&&
"I've found that when using these my oily skin is just less oily. I use one when I wake up and another before bed.

People complain about the smell, but I think it's fine. It's fruity and floral - I'd prefer something neutral but the bottom line is that these do a great job of clearing up oily skin problems and that's all that matters."	&&&
These are great wipes, very thick and super easy clean up....I have even gotten the daycare center my daughter attends to start using them...	&&&
"I gave it one star because that was the lowest offered.
These wipes made my skin feel like I had a sunburn. I made chamomile tea, cooled it with ice chips, soaked a wash cloth with it to help with the burning sensation. It still itches and is quite uncomfortable after 5 hours.
It caused lots of small bumps as well."	&&&
It has not been easy finding anti-reflective cleaner in your local pharmacy stores. This product was definitely a good buy.	&&&
Good for everything: wipe your nose, clean your face, remove makeup, use instead of a shower to shower cloth, whatever. Just use a different wipe for each of those :)	&&&
These are so easy to use and really help with that gross feeling, especially on those heavier days. I never see them anymore though. I used to buy them all the time but I haven't seen them in months.	&&&
The armor all cloths works wonders on the inside of my cars. The best place to use these in the care is the dashboard. My car looks and smells like new when I use the armor all cloths on the surface. The cloths destroy any dust that accumulates on the dashboard. I also use the armor all cloths on the exterior of the car too. Pollen is horrible this time of the year in the south where I live, and it tends to build up on my car. The armor all cloths remove the pollen with ease. The cloths also help to clean bird droppings that appear on my car. My car has a shine to it after I use the armor all cloths. I usually use a couple of the cloths each time I clean my whole car. The package contains a large amount of the cloths and the last a long time. I clean my car about once every two weeks and the package can last me a few months. This is a great product to use if you are not looking to spend a lot of money cleaning the car but want it to look its best.	&&&
I needed something other than a t-shirt or Kleenex to clean my expensive eye glasses. These are great and easy to carry with the ability to safely clean even my smart phone screen.	&&&
So nice product. It is really helpful to clean up the dirty and all the make up at the end of the day. The only BUT Is the price: 9 dollars....	&&&
Good value for money, great quality. Passes the test of my kid	&&&
My daughters father bought me the big box which came with 800 + pampers which was awesome. I like that the pampers come in little tiny packs so I can take a pack with me when im on the go, or put it in the baby wipe box holder that it comes with. Very nice.. I like the quality!	&&&
So strong! One wipe can handle a messy diaper. 2 for a blow out.	&&&
Good product. I order them from Amazon,as I do a lot of staples, because, at 91 years old, it's very convenient.	&&&
I prefer not to write a review but you can't rate without writing a review hopefully they will be able to change this in the future	&&&
I like this product. It doesn't have an offensive smell, it doesn't burn my eyes, and my sensitive skin isn't irritated when I use it. And it actually cleans because I'm always surprised by how much it picks up when I'm done cleaning my face. I also like how easy and not messy it is. Just pull a towelette out of the package, wipe your face, throw it away, and do whatever else you do for your face routine. I will buy this again when I run out.	&&&
My son was getting a diaper rash from other wipes. Then I tried these and they really helped. He doesn't get rashes any more!!	&&&
Cleansing cloths too small	&&&
"I subscribe this one for my baby and I am vert satisfied this this product as well as my baby.
I love to recommend to you to try out.."	&&&
Very good product. This is a big container that will last for quite a while. Amazon was the only place I found this.	&&&
"The first time I ordered this type of wipes, it was Lysol brand. When I went to reorder it in my Subscribe and Save it was out of stock, so I bought these Clorox wipes instead. Both of the brands clean great! It's just a choice of scent. These wipes cut grease incredibly well, and make short work of many general cleaning tasks. If you have children, these wipes will reduce germs that cause illness on things like doorknobs, faucets and toilet handles.

I used to be an unhappy housekeeper, and hated having to clean the kitchen up every day. I hated trying to get bacon splatters and cooked on, dried food dribbles from bubbling pots off the stove top, and I hated wiping the counters.

After I began using this type of wipes, over a period of a couple of months, it changed everything and now I actually enjoy cleaning things in the kitchen! It cleans so well! The rice cooker and coffeemaker are spotless, the exterior of the fridge and inside the microwave oven so clean they shine; effortless cleaning ... Now my stove top is sparkling clean all the time, the counters are sanitary and inviting to use; my stainless tea kettle and the small appliances are perfectly spotless. It makes cleaning the fridge interior SO much easier, I don't dread it any more. It makes the faucets look so clean and bright, and it cleans the bath and kitchen sinks very well.

You will like these wipes!"	&&&
These things are FABULOUS! Got the small pack just to see what I thought and I will definitely be purchasing it again (probably a larger pack!). Wanted something for my bathroom counter that didn't leave a residue like my Clorox wipes seemed to. These things leave no residue, smell good, and can just be flushed down the toilet, which is super convenient. Love them!	&&&
These are nice. I font like them on newborns or sensitive skin though.	&&&
Great product and makes cleaning stainless steel a breeze. Hard to find at stores but not 8n amazon. Excellent product and would recommend.	&&&
I've used wipes from Pampers and from Huggies and I have to say that I like the Pampers wipes better. I don't like the way the Huggies wipes are attached together and you have to tear them apart to use them. Also, Huggies wipes are dryer than the Pampers wipes.	&&&
I use this product exclusively to wet-clean my ceramic tile floors as I can no longer use the "hands & knees" process. Wet (sponge/rag) mops made a mess all along my white painted baseboards. In my opinion, the dry-vacuuming feature is weak (but still better than a broom) so I just use a separate product specifically for vacuuming. Product is sturdier than I had anticipated for the price. The spin-scrub, wet-vacuum features work great. My house is a no-pet, no-mud zone so I can't attest to how this product would work for those situations. The Hoover FloorMate Multi-Floor cleaning solution (1 pt. included w/purchase) does NOT leave a residue on the tile. (Product is available retail in my locale.) I had a real mess trying to remove a tile floor shine product and after 3 consecutive 'cleanings' with this product the floor was back to normal.	&&&
These are not the first wipes I have bought from Walmart, but these are not that good. They are very dry wipes not good for cleaning keyboards or other electronics. They barely have enough to wipes a cut clean. I don't recommend them for any use.	&&&
I love disinfecting wipes ... they are so handy and makes cleaning way quicker.	&&&
"These wipes are great, our child had issues with diaper rash and the wiping process at changings was a painful one for her and frustrating for us. These worked great to resolve that issue.

The reason we give these 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wipes are a pain in the butt to get out of the package- they are not collated like tissues or other wipes to easily grab one at a time, instead they are clumped together in pairs and we often take out more than we need and have to stuff them back in.

If they worked better from an engineering standpoint, they'd be 5 stars."	&&&
I've used up numerous amounts of the wipes dispenser from the drugstore because the rubber on top of it always tears and it makes you pull a foot of wipes unless you use two hands! but with this wipes dispenser it makes my life easier and it makes cleaning dirty babies faster! it only dispenses one wipe per pull which makes it perfect for saving and makes diaper changes A LOT FASTER!	&&&
I love clorox disinfecting wipes because is very easy to use, deodorizes and disinfects all in one simple wipe, my favorite is Fresh Scent.	&&&
I like to use clorox disinfecting wipes all over my house including the bathroom, kitchen, dining room, and living room.	&&&
These cloth wipes work well, but so do the wipes I made by cutting up an old, flimsy Gerber baby towel - which is a lot cheaper.	&&&
This is the best disinfect product hands down!! I have a 5yr. old son with Asthma, who is prone to diseases around flu season.. I disinfect my whole house with these wipes, from the base boards to bed head boards, light switches & door knobs!!! The wipes keep my family safe along with good hand washing & hygiene! Thanks Clorox	&&&
I love the Clorox Wipes! They are convenient for on the go and perfect for when you have young children.	&&&
I love the wipes, the house feels clean after using.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are easy to use and convenient	&&&
they are the best. i would recommend this to everyone .	&&&
Love these cloths. I was pleased to find heavy duty Handi Wipes. I have not seen these in the store. I was stitching two regular ones together to get this thickness! Use them and toss them...	&&&
Love these wipes. They are so handy and clean very well.	&&&
When you need to sanitize a surface and clean it off these wipes are the best. Lemony fresh scent. Don't look at the wipe after you use it as you might be shocked at the dirt and grime it picks up off what seem to be "clean" surfaces. Recommended.	&&&
"Great value in multi pack. Perfect time of year for lysol wipes"	&&&
"Egreen Killeen texas
The Clorox wipes are amazing perfect for disinfecting and cleaning countertops and things. Simply amazing!!"	&&&
Love these wipes! I was going to buy a "high end" brand, but the store was sold out. Luckily the sales gal introduced me to these wipes. They clean very well, even eye make-up! They don't irritate or dry out my skin. And I love that they are actually moist! Some wipes seem so dry, but not these! All the wipes are moist, not just the 2 at the bottom. Very happy with my purchase! Definitely will purchase again!	&&&
I used these washcloths for both my newborn boys. When you are in the hospital they use washcloths to clean their lil bottoms and recommend you continue to use these washcloths since store bought baby wipes can be irritating to their new gentle skin. Well these work great! I soak them in warm water and have used them and still use them to wipe my babies face, give him a bath, wipe his bottom for diaper changes, etc, etc! The washcloths are so big, I actually cut them in half. Take a pair of scissors and simply cut the washcloth in half. Before you cut the washcloth make sure your scissors are clean. Carefully clean them with soap and water or clean the blade with an alcohol wipe.	&&&
The Clorox wipes is my go to cleaning wipe for the kitchen and bathroom but, I use it all through out the house.	&&&
i use these wipes daily with my cleaning regiment!	&&&
I love these wipes because of the convenience. They smell wonderful and they get the job done efficiently and effectively!	&&&
I love Clorox! I feel better knowing that the item i am wiping is disinfected when I use the wipes!!	&&&
The best baby wipes on the market.	&&&
"The Lysol wipes is good product to use to do touch up around your house. However, they are a little small. I would say they too small for men to use but okay for women and children. They are also thin. I strongly recommend using two or three at a time because they are so thin. Watch out for using them too often on bathroom counter tops because they are strong. Also the lemon and lime scents will eventually turn your countertops yellow. Other then that great product for touch up in between full cleaning of faucets, countertops and toilets."	&&&
These wipes get the job done without destroying your very expensive transitional lenses. Best used with a similar styled dry cloth (usually available from your eye glasses store) Great price as well.	&&&
I literally use these wipes to clean my entire house! They are easy and convenient, and really work. I have these in my bathrooms, in my kitchen, in my kid's play room.... everywhere!	&&&
I love these Clorox wipes. They are convenient, kill germs and easy to use.	&&&
I'm a new mom and was really excited about the idea of using all natural wipes. I love that they are for sensitive skin but they don't hold up worth a poop. LITERALLY! When my little man poops I have to battle wipe lint everywhere! They literally peel apart and I invested in a huge case before I knew this...I won't buy them again!	&&&
I have no idea what I would do everyday it out my clorox wipes. I love how clean it makes everything and also smells pleasant. I would definitely recommend this to everyone i know!	&&&
OMG wonderful wipes and this is a great package deal.	&&&
The wipes are okay ..but they aren't folded together so they can feed out of the package . It's very difficult to get them out!	&&&
Boogie Wipes get the job done!! We do not go without them. When our boys get yucky noses we don't use anything else. Protecting them from a raw nose while keeping them clean. Would definitely recommend to anyone with children!!	&&&
We have bought these when our kids have colds and get sore noses from too much blowing. Boogie Wipes totally keep them from getting sore noses and make it so much easier for already miserable kids. And great for general clean up etc too!	&&&
These are my favorite types of wipes for my little one.	&&&
My daughter is a 3 yr old toddler, so wipes are still much needed, but we need convenience. I like these wipes because they stayed moist over a 2 week time frame. The packaging is small enough to be convenient and easy to carry because my daughter now carries smaller backpacks or little girl purses. I also got a clean face during a nose clean because the material doesn't smear stuff on her face.	&&&
My sons have super sensitive skin and these are the only wipes that I can use on them. I over love these wipes!	&&&
I loooove my Kandoo wipes! No better clean than a Kandoo clean!	&&&
I absolutely love the strength in these wipes. They also clean very gently. Pampers is my first choice in wipes because all wipes are not created equal!	&&&
These are the only wipes I buy! I try and limit the fragrances and chemicals I expose my baby to. I love that these wipes are fragrance free and gentle on her delicate skin. The wipes aren't too dry or overly moisturized and don't leave a slimy feel on my baby's skin after use.	&&&
"Most stainless steel wipes never work and still lave smudges. However, these work awesome. They definitely clean all the fingerprints and small smudges off of the fridge, stove and dishwasher.

It does leave an awkward film. The film when dry leaves everything shiny so don't worry wen you start cleaning and a white filmy substance looks like it needs to be cleaned off more with a rag. Just leave it. Keep in mind you may get little cotton fibers. The little cotton fibers stick to your appliances every now and then. It's not a big deal and it's not all the wipes. I used a can of compressed air and it left everything looking brand new!"	&&&
The wipes are okay ..but they aren't folded together so they can feed out of the package .It's very difficult to get them out!	&&&
We use these bad boys for EVERYTHING. . These a smaller and thinner then most "baby wipes".. thats perfect for my little ones hands and faces ..what else is great they don't leave the skin feeling tacky or smelling . . And yes to me most wipes especially the unsented do end up smelling funny ...	&&&
Love the clean smell of the wipes, hypoallergenic, I use these everywhere!	&&&
Love these pampers wipes - they smell great and are big and thick.	&&&
Our pediatrician recommended using these wipes to help keep my daughter's diaper rash at bay. We have tried periodically using other wipes but these are by far the best! No more diaper rash and that is worth every penny these costs. Knowing what is going on my daughter's sensitive skin is very important. And keeping her healthy is TOP priority.	&&&
I've never heard of boogie wipes before but I'm glad that I did now because they are great to use.	&&&
"I have used BabyGanics wipes for the past 4 years. The new ones are not as sturdy as the previous version (yellow package). These are thinner and have a stretch to them and it makes it hard to really get a clean wipe."	&&&
Love these wipes! Work great!	&&&
I used Boggie Wipes on my 6 month old granddaughters little nose and it was so gentle and soft.	&&&
Overall, I am pleased with the wipes. They are large enough to get even the biggest of messes taken care of and allow you to get the baby wiped up without needing to use a soiled area again. They are soft and feel great against the skin. I imagine they feel great for the babies as well. There is just the right amount of moisture and I like knowing that I'm not adding any harmful chemicals to my babies body by using them. I received a free sample of these wipes in exchange for my honest opinion and review.	&&&
With 10 grandkids we are always wiping a nose or a butt...can't get enough of these Boogie Wipes...cannot imagine life without them...Thanks so much...with kids of all ages (18 years to 10 months) there is going to be a need for a Boogie Wipe...	&&&
I used these wipes for my twins. They are great for skin that is red and raw from colds. Very gentle and smell great, too!	&&&
I LOVED these wipes and I love the smell! I bought these and they have lasted a good few months.I like how they were thick and didn't break when wiping compared to other brands. Will buy again!	&&&
Until I got these wipes, I thought I would have to return my scanner. They restored it so the scanning looks perfect again.	&&&
The product performs and smells as stated. However, the packaging is not good. The opening is too small and makes it difficult to take out only one wipe. Usually 2 wipes come out and the extra one can't be put pack into the package so it dries out. Also, they could be half the size...could have 60 instead of 30	&&&
We have been using Boogie Wipes since our daughter was little. We love the convenience and how well they work at keeping her nose clean. She even asks for a Boogie Wipe now when her nose is runny.	&&&
Love Huggies wipes over any other brand, they are thick enough to get the job done and done irritate my kids skin. I use the wipes for everything!	&&&
Pampers wipes are my favorite. They don't rip and very gentle on my baby's bottom!	&&&
I used to use these always but got some Kirkland wipes on sale. After using those and coming back to these it seems these are more rough. They don't glide as easily as the Kirkland wipes. Perhaps they're more dry. I'm not sure but I think I'll use these and go back to Kirkland in the future.	&&&
I love these... no loud smell... great little wipes!!!	&&&
Clorox Wipes are great for clean-up jobs that cannot be completed with a sponge, such as the computer keyboard and mouse. It's important to clean these items thoroughly, as they are often the most used, and most germ-filled items in the home.	&&&
I have been using Clorox Disinfecting wipes for years now, and LOVE them! I have three kids at home and i'm a full time student, so I need to save time and money everywhere I can, and these wipes help with that!	&&&
Love these wipes...I use them on my glasses and they're the only ones that seem to get them clean without leaving small particles of cloth behind. Also great for my iPhone and my rifle optics.	&&&
These don't work any better than baby wipes. Waste of money to get these....	&&&
i love clorox wipes. they smell good, clean up messes very well, and at the same time disinfect!	&&&
I love pampers and their wipes. I have never had any problems with either the diapers or wipes and I would recommend this whole brand to any new mother or any new mom that needs advice on diapers or wipes. Remember ladies you get what you pay for. You want the cheap diapers, don't complain when your doing more laundry because of leaks...or worse..poop!!!	&&&
love these wipes to use at my retail job during cold season. keeps me from geting sick	&&&
I love clorox Wipes, I am a school teacher and these really come in handy in the classroom. Love Them	&&&
I love the Clorox disinfecting wipes. They kill 99% of bacteria and leaves the house fresh and clean.	&&&
I love this product. I have used for years in my home.	&&&
"Normally I buy generic but I was in a rush and needed wipes within a couple of days and I knew I'd not make it to the store on time. The over all quality of these are fine. That isn't why I gave it a 3. I gave it a 3 because the wipes themselves are smaller than my usual generic brand AND there are at least 300 less total for more money. My generic are just a soft and clean just as well and as anyone with a little one knows you have to save pennies where you can.

In the future I will make sure that I have enough generic to last until I can make it to the store."	&&&
these are great wipes. i love using these. pampers brand is great	&&&
These Lysol wipes are by far one of my favorites. They are super strong and are great for cleaning all through the day. The lemon lime also smells really good and isn't too strong. When I ordered this set it was about eight bucks and for that it is for sure worth it. Great wipes at a great price, Recommended!	&&&
I love using the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for everyday use around my house. From little smudges on the TV to sticky jelly on the counter, these wipes can do it all. I love how easy it is to use, even my husband can clean!	&&&
5 STARS! ????? GRADE A+ FLUSH-ABLE WIPES. NEVER CLOGS THE TOILET! FANTASTIC WIPES!	&&&
I love the lemon smell the Clorox wipes and spray. My kitchen smells very fresh and clean, Great Product!	&&&
I use the Clorox disinfecting wipes in my kitchen and they are perfect for a quick and easy cleanup	&&&
Perfect Coat Bath Wipes are my favorite wipes for my white and hard to keep clean Malti-Pom, Beori. This will not substitue a regular bath, but it's great after a hike or walk in the park or for wiping her tushy after she goes.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are one of the best inventions ever. I use them at home and at work.	&&&
I use it to wipe the door knob too, especially after the party	&&&
They work for all your lens and phone/tablets that need cleaning. I trust Zeiss for my cleaning needs, been using them for for a while and have had no complaints. Just don't stock and keep for too long. They will start to dry out after a few months. Keep lots of them on hand and order often. Pricing is good and not much more you can say about lens wipes.	&&&
I love these wipes. I use hem at home and in my diaper bag. I love the scent and softness.	&&&
Love the rough surface on the disinfectant wipes! Cleans great and smells great!	&&&
I love how thick huggies wipes are! They are great at wiping messy bums!	&&&
I use these wipes for everything, from home to garage. It really helps get the grime off stuff.	&&&
I have grown up using Clorox products. Now that I have my own family, the bleach, toilet cleaner, disinfecting wipes and laundry stain remover are staples in my home. Great products!	&&&
Good Product. These wipes are handy to have around. I have one in every room of the house.	&&&
I like the wipes for everyday cleaning up messes or just disinfecting and I love the smell!	&&&
I use these wipes everyday since it has been flu season	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. iS EASY TO USE AND MAINTENCE CLEAN TOYS AND ALL THINGS WHAT THE BABY USE	&&&
I love clorox wipes for little messes around the house. Convenient and works great	&&&
Best chlorine free wipes on the market and at a great price...	&&&
Theses wipes are great round the house	&&&
I love Clorox wipes as they are easily disposal, deodorizes and disinfects and is a trusted household name with my family! I have no problems when I say, "Get a Clorox wipe!"	&&&
The Lemon wipes are one of my favorite products. I love how fresh and clean they smell and how I never have to worry about germs after using them. I wipe down everything with them: door handles, light switches, phones, remotes, sink handles, and I do the same at work. I don't want to be sick and these give me the peace of mind that the job will get done!	&&&
These wipes are great they don't dry out quick and their made for sensitive skin, which is needed when you have no clue what your new born is allergic to.	&&&
My mini poodle has skin problems and these wipes help so much.	&&&
This is our second Warmies purchase. First one lasted us 4 yrs before the adapter went out. It was $6 more to just buy a new warmer than it was to replace the adapter once shipping was factored in. We skip the antibacterial pad and have never had any issues. Just change out water every other day or so. We use a mixture of flannel/velour and bamboo wipes. I don't care for the Warmies brand of wipes that came with.	&&&
love to use the wipes when cleaning the bathroom. you gotta love boys!!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. Makes cleaning the bathroom and kitchen so much more efficient! The convenience can't be beat!	&&&
I am soo happy I found these. My son used to get diaper rash so bad it would bleed and putting cream on a screaming, squirming toddler sucks. With these- no rash. The smell is nice, but reminds me of a litter box. It doesn't linger and we don't use them often enough for me to switch wipes again. Plus, the benefit of a happy, rash-free baby makes it worth it.	&&&
I Love the quick clean up I do with the Lemon or Orange Clorox wipes in the kitchen and the smell puts a smile on my face.	&&&
I've tried other brands of disinfecting wipes but always end up going back to Clorox, nothing compares!	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy and convenient for cleaning all areas of our home. From the little messes to the big messes Clorox keeps our home smelling fresh and clean and disinfected.	&&&
Clorox cleaning wipes are so convenient to use I keep a container in each bathroom & under kitchen sink.	&&&
I love the convenience of the wipes. Easy for anyone in the house to use.	&&&
good at disinfecting. we take them on vacation and use them to disinfect hotel	&&&
Excellent product. I use it daily in my home. Quick and easy clean up.	&&&
Having young kids, I use Clorox wipes for everything! When they get sick, we wipe everything down with Clorox wipes. I love having things be clean. Thanks Clorox!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! I use them to clean counter tops and clean my baby's toys! They are perfect! & smell wonderful to. Makes your house smell clean.	&&&
I keep Clorox Wipes under every sink in the house. Easy to use and I know they disinfect well!	&&&
These wipes are great! The scent is subtle and smells good. These clean well and my newborn hasn't had any skin sensitivity issues with these wipes!	&&&
I really do like these wipes except the smell. But overall it does its job :)	&&&
My daughter had strep throat and she sucks her thumb :( but with the help of Clorox wipes no one else in my family got sick :)	&&&
By far the best wipes I've used. I keep some in every bathroom in my house, as well as my kitchen and even my car. I feel good knowing it's killing germs!	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes to disinfect and clean. It is very convenient especially when cleaning restrooms and counters.	&&&
Pretty disappointed. I was excited about these... bought three of them. They are very dry and pretty much useless. Not sure why regular Clorox wipes work and these don't. But they really don't.	&&&
Love Colrox wipes because they are easy to use and clean just about anything.	&&&
Love the large size 110 wipes will order again love the fact that I can get these in 1 business day	&&&
I was developing itchy red, dry, flakey patches around my eyes. I threw out all of the skin care products I had been using on my face and am now using only the Aveeno Ultra Calming products. I am experiencing such an improvement, and so quickly. I couldn't be happier about making the change to Aveeno Ultra Calming.	&&&
Returned it because it was too big for my changing table	&&&
These are very sticky to the touch. I feel like I have to wear gloves when using them. I also can't get them to pick up much dust. Several are needed to clean a table or shelf. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or if I just don't like the way they work.	&&&
Gets the babies bum clean quickly and softly! Highly recommended!	&&&
I like knowing, I got more in the closet. Flu season is upon us, stock up!	&&&
They work well. Great price for the quantity. However, the only problem I have with them is the funky smell that have even though they're not supposed to be scented. It gets stronger when put into a wipes warmer. The first time it actually had me sniffing around to find out where it was coming from...	&&&
Strong and sturdy...these baby wipes are not only safe for my children, they get the job done without tearing. "I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
I LOVE using these wipes! It keeps their nose from drying out. Love love love	&&&
Let's see, well they hold their "contents" well and almost never leak unless we've put them on wrong in a hurry. They don't irritate our toddler's skin or seem to cause any discomfort. The tabs hold well and have yet to come undone. The subscription keeps us stocked. These have worked a lot better than other brands and seem less toxic for both the child and the environment, but that might be good marketing.	&&&
Great bulk product!	&&&
I have been a very loyal fan of Target's Up&Up brand sensitive wipes since my daughter's birth 2.5 years ago. I keep trying other brands and formulas and always return disappointed in the other brands' quality, lasting power and/or find they irritate my daughter's sensitive skin. These are the first wipes that not only hold up in all three categories against Target's wipes, they blast them out of the water. These are thick, but not so thick I feel like I'm wiping her off with a blanket. They are moist, without dripping liquid all over when you grab one out. They are velvety soft, have zero smell to them (and I am very sensitive to smells). They clean the horrible substance known as toddler poop off with less than 1/3 of the number of wipes the Target brand takes. Finally, they're one of the only wipes I've used on my own skin and found really pleasant. Many wipes leave your skin feel sticky, tingly, roughed up, irritated or some combination of those unpleasant things. These just seem to leave your skin feeling a little moist and very clean. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm so in love with these we are making the switch, even with these being more expensive per wipe (when not on sale). If you're looking for the perfect wipe, this is it.	&&&
Only brand I'll use	&&&
Yep cleans the bums lol.	&&&
These makeup remover wipes take off even the darkest shades of lipstick in seconds! It even takes off long wearing lipstick with ease. It's an amazing product and I would recommend it to everyone.	&&&
Work great. Gentle and soft on my baby!	&&&
I've barely made it through my 1st pack and I love them! Great to have 2 different scents so you don't go crazy with the one scent through 3 packs.	&&&
Very dry. Not useful at all. I bought them while travelling and never got to use them because they are very dry.	&&&
smell great work great	&&&
Exselent wipes	&&&
Love these wipes. My son is 19 months now and has never had diaper rash. Best wipes ever!	&&&
Good product. Does the job for what it says it'll do.	&&&
Daughter LOVES these!	&&&
The first time we ordered these, we loved them! We ordered them again, and we received a different type of wipe: shorter, thinner, and more moist. We hated these wipes but ordered them again when we ran out, hoping we'd receive the first type again. But alas! We were sent the thinner and shorter kind again. So I'm not sure if they've changed their formulation, or if the first type was a different type of Earth's Best wipe and was sent on accident, but these thinner wipes are awful! They are so small and hard to hold that we constantly get our hands dirty while using them, and we have to use like twice as many as the other kind.	&&&
"The best product I ever bought for my babies nose smells good and works great"	&&&
Best stainless cleaner available. Doesn't streak and leaves a protective covering to prevent future smudges and dirt. I use it on all my stainless appliances.	&&&
These have a weird sticky substance coating them, presumably for catching the dust. It feels kind of gross to use, and does not seem to actually trap the dust the way the competition does. Our house has a rabbit, and hardwood floors, so I'm forever dusting. I bought these when they were on sale, now I have to make myself get through them so I can go back to the other brand.	&&&
We use these to clean just about everything. I am a slight germaphobe and this satisfies my need to sterilize everything. They are very convenient and prevent having to use paper towels with a separate cleaner.	&&&
These smell great and are very gentle. They may be too gentle as they do not actually remove my eye makeup.... I have to go over my eyes quite a few times and even then there is still some there.	&&&
This review is for Specific Beauty's Eye makeup Remove Wipes in a twin pack. There are 30 wipes per package and the instructions say to use one in the morning and one in the evening, but I only use one at night to remove my makeup. (In the morning, I don't feel the need to use anything other than a quick wipe with some toner on a cotton round.) These cloths compare to others I have used in size and shape although these seem a little heavier and sturdier, unlikely to rip or tear while using. I feel they are a little too dry, which made me have to rub my eyes longer than usual to get all of my mascara to come off. I do like the little nubs on one side of the cloth, I think they help lift the dirt and makeup off the skin but they cause no irritation. I purchased this twin pack of makeup remover wipes at a deep discount in exchange for my honest review and I have used them the last 3 nights to remove my makeup. They are almost completely unscented and they leave my skin feeling soft. I do use a toner afterwards to remove any makeup or residue left. I generally like everything about these wipes, their strength, their lack of perfume, I like the nubs of texture on one side, I like the natural ingredients...but the dry feeling of the cloths is a problem and if the second package is as dry as the first, I will probably not repurchase these otherwise nice makeup remover wipes.	&&&
This is our favorite brand. We got it as part of a special deal so it meant one less thing to get at Costco	&&&
I have sensitive skin & I was very disappointed with this product. Not only did it not remove makeup as I expected but it burn sooo bad! Especially around the eye area. Wish I could've read the reviews before I bought it.	&&&
These wipes work great for their purpose and have decent ingredients.	&&&
Apparently unscented means rancid. We have used Kirkland wipes for years and thought they were the best wipes ever, now they are the worst ever. My kids even complained of the smell and won't go near them. We have had to go back to using another brand. They also feel thinner and make your skin feel slimy. Please bring back the truly unscented wipes and leave the funky aloe/vitamin E out! It's bad!	&&&
I absolutely love these disinfecting wipes. They're so unbelievably convenient and helpful. I have a canister of these wipes in my kitchen, garage, and each of the bathrooms. Sometimes spray cleaners are just a big hassle and mess. These wipes make clean ups painless.	&&&
Wow these wipes are amazing. The container they come in is just great quality and so are the wipes themselves. Very durable and I use mine for all my cleaning needs. I have even used these on my laptop screen. very safe. every household must own! I received these in exchanger for honest unbiased review. All views and opinions are 100% of my own.	&&&
As a cloth-diapering, stay-at-home Dad to 2.5 year old twins I can't tell you how much the little things like getting good, brand-name baby wipes delivered to us in a box on the porch at consistent intervals and pricing consistently much lower than any stores in town. Most importantly, by using subscribe and save to get 2 boxes every 2 months, it has saved me from ever having to haul two newborns, infants, babies, or toddlers out in all kinds of weather to pick up something as ridiculously useless as baby wipes. From before their birth, all the way thru to our current potty training battles-- I've never made a trip to the store for baby wipes... or disposable diapers with cloth diapers at my disposal!	&&&
I'm trying to get my kiddos to help out around the house. The wipes are awesome for little hands to use to clean up messes.	&&&
I like to use Clorox wipes because they are easy to use.	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use -- love that they disinfect too!	&&&
Pampers wipes, unlike Huggies are very thick. You don't have to use as many wipes as you would have to use for huggies because it wipes and clean up more.	&&&
love clorox wipes disenfects goog dont have to worry about germs	&&&
some unopened wipes are dried out!!!! madness!	&&&
These wipes feel so natural and clean for baby, which is a great plus! However, I find that small pieces come off of the wipe sometimes while using.	&&&
I am an elementary school teacher and I love this product! The Lysol Disinfecting Wipes are a must in my daily life! I use these daily at home, but, I don't know what I'd do without them at work! I clean computer keyboards, desks, and book covers to name a few uses at work. At home they are do handy cleaning up and around the bathroom sink or pet accidents. I am very pleased with this product. I use them on just about everything and I have never damaged anything I used them on, such as the covers of books.	&&&
Great for wiping the nose and face area. My son has really sensitive skin so these are much better than the regular baby wipes.	&&&
I love the disinfectant wipes! So much help cleaning up after 4 kids!!	&&&
"Great wipes, they do the job. I use them on my puppy after he runs around outside, and he smells like a baby now.
4/5 stars since I thought they would come in their own little dispenser thingy. They don't, at least the ones I got."	&&&
I've been searching for the perfect makeup wipe for years. I find most products leave my face feeling greasy. These wipes are fantastic! One sheet removes all my makeup. (Note: I don't wear eyeliner and I mostly wear neutral shades) I love that there's no fragrance and these don't irritate my skin. These wipes aren't the most expensive but they also aren't cheap but a portion of the sales go to help Polar Bears. I will continue to purchase these wipes!	&&&
Love these wipes they are just right for the baby's bottom! Tried other brands and felt the roughness on tushy and didnt clean so well but with pampers wipe it was soft for the skin and tough on the poops! Great product!	&&&
I always use Pampers wipes. My child has sensitive skin, and these wipes never irritate her.	&&&
We purchased these because they were out of the sensitive wipes. These are very soft but they do have a stronger scent. Great stand in but prefer the sensitive ones.	&&&
I really love Clorox disinfecting wipes because I am a full time mother and a part time student. This product help me provide a healthy bacteria free zone for my child and give me more time to attend to my daily task.	&&&
I had a friend stop by unannounced and I clearned up with clorox wipes and friends didn't even know it took me literally a few seconds to clean a big mess. would recommend over and over. love this brand and producs	&&&
"This product is a must for all mothers! The way it loosens noses and eases my little girls runny nose is a lifesaver. No more irritated noses due to dryness or excessive blowing/runny nose. These wipes ease the nose and are great for adults too. The saline solution is gentle and effective."	&&&
I simply love these wipes. They smell good withouth being overpowering and they clean really well. I have them everywhere in drawers around my house, work and car. Great buy!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! With 3 children, the ease and convenience is such a time-saver! I use these to wipe down my bathroom counter daily and for other messes and spills.	&&&
Chlorox wipes are wonderful to have around the kitchen - easy to use, disinfect high traffic areas, and leave a pleasant lingering scent.	&&&
I have used these these wipes for many years, which have continually been improved in design and strength over time. The wipes are supposed to be 'scentless' and now (like every other recent identical review) have a stale smell similar to stale roses. The SKU and barcode are the same on the new product as the old product, so if they are ever changed back to the previous 'scentless product', I don't know how I would ever know, unless I randomly tried another box in six months. I would hope that COSTCO has a panel of people to test these products as opposed to one buyer who allowed the change to occur, without consulting anyone. If a product is perfect in every way, why do people need to mess with it, rather than leave well enough alone?	&&&
I always prefer Clorox products - I take their portable disinfecting wipes when I travel so I can wipe everything down when I sit down on the plane!	&&&
Having a toddler boy in the house, these wipes are used daily. Love the product!	&&&
"These are great for use at home or on the go, especially in the car! Started buying Boogie Wipes when my nearly 6-year-old was an infant. They've worked great on him and on his 2 1/2-year-old sister. She gets runny noses all the time it seems, and if I use too many tissues, her nose gets absolutely RAW! She will say, no Kleenex! My nose hurts! So I use Boogie Wipes when she has a runny nose or a cold. They are a bit expensive, but I go to their website often for printable coupons. They really are worth the extra money!"	&&&
They are easily accessible and clean dirty surfaces quickly and effectively.	&&&
Weiman's Stainless Steel Wipes are easy to use and a real time saver. Our kitchen appliances sparkle after they are cleaned with Weiman."}}];	&&&
I've used other brands but huggies is the best in all honesty, it is not rough and cleans thorough!!	&&&
I have combo skin so I need something that will not dry out my skin. These work wonders. No dry skin patches, redness, or greasiness. They leave your face feeling soft and hydrated. I thought I'd give the others "healthy radiance" I belive and my skin was peeling. Will be replacing those with these."}	&&&
We use these in sick room care and throughout the home. They are the best product for helping to provide a clean, germ free environment.	&&&
These clean great and smell lovely! Gentle on skin (no irritations) and very strong so things don't go through the wipe and onto your hands.	&&&
we used it one for the baby. It is not bad, but not as good as the sensitive one.	&&&
as a pampers the best that's it. I did try to buy different brand but I came back to it	&&&
This product removed 3 layers of pesky mascara with ease! It also worked well on my foundation and lipstick. It cleansed my face without drying, and my skin felt hydrated afterward. 5 stars.	&&&
This is a good start to removing makeup and cleaning your skin before bed. I usually use one of these towelettes after I come home from work. Later, before bed, I wash my face completely. These do a pretty good job. The price is right, good ingredients and no animal testing makes it a worthwhile product.	&&&
I was not a fan of these. My son has sensitive skin but these are so soft they don't grip at all so they just smear poop around instead of wiping it off.	&&&
I was so disappointed by these! They smell nice, but feel very dry and a little greasy out of the package. They are much drier than the Neutrogena cloths I normally use, to the extent that I had to struggle to remove my mascara with the cloth from the newly opened package. Shortly after removing my makeup with the wipe, I realized my face had turned an alarming, blotchy red color, and felt a little hot/inflamed. I rinsed my face with water and it settled down after a couple of minutes, but seriously? I do not typically have sensitive skin. I am thinking that the citrus oils probably cause the irritation, but who knows? I hate to throw out a brand new package, but out it will go!	&&&
Fresh scent, nice large size, removes eye & face makeup very well. Might be even better if one side was a bit rougher to exfoliate at the same time.	&&&
Pampers baby fresh wipes get the job done of cleaning your babies bottom while leaving a fresh sent.	&&&
I love Pampers products. These wipes are great, but I don't care too much for the scent of these.	&&&
Does the jobs, beautifully, holds up, can wash for reuse. I have used these for years, cannot find in grocery stores	&&&
I love these small and portable packets. I use them for my daughter when we're on the go. I also bought the dispenser but I like this better because I can fit it into my pocket and it makes things easier traveling with a kid to have lighter things.	&&&
They just smoosh around when you are trying to wipe! Even if you start off with a fold over! I will be going back to a regular type.	&&&
Pretty good all things considered. My skin felt a little sticky afterwards though. Probably won't buy again but they were great as an in-between makeup remover!	&&&
Loved this thing for the first five months. Then it just stopped latching to stay closed. So, now I'm stuck with a broken box.	&&&
We use these in sick room care and throughout the home. They are the best product for helping to provide a clean, germ free environment.	&&&
These work well in cleaning the pump and accessories but do not use on your skin it will burn! I made the mistake of using one to wipe the milk off my breast after pumping and ouch!! I didn't see a warning for this on the back of the bag, I could have missed it though. But to clean the pump they work great.	&&&
I use these not just for cleaning bottoms but they come in handy for all kinds of other messes. Cleaning faces, wiping off belly's, cleaning hands and runny noses. I always keep a pack in my purse. You never know when some might come in handy! They smell so good too!!!!	&&&
Let me tell you how handy this product is. I am potty training twin boys and sometimes accidents happen. In between bathroom cleanings, I use this product to wipe and disinfect those accidents, without worrying if I missed anything. This way I don't have to lug out my bucket of bleach to clean a relatively simple cleanup. Because they are now so frequent, this product is an absolute must have. I love this product, and keep a ready supply of them on hand.	&&&
Disappointed they stopped carrying these in the local club but glad to still have them available online.	&&&
I've been using pampers wipes since my son was born and I use them for a lot more stuff now besides his tush! Lol! Love them	&&&
These wipes work very well and are a good value for your money. You tend to get more in a box than if you buy the sensitive, although I prefer the sensitive for my baby as she has very fair, sensitive skin.	&&&
I totally love this wipe, I find that it is durable and even when there are big blow outs I don't need to use as much wipes unlike the other brands. I like the smell but would prefer a little more powdery scent to it.	&&&
I bought this as an impulse buy and just re-ordered it. Not clear on why there are two dispenser packs and a bunch of refill packs since the dispenser packs are not refillable, but these are great. They clean very thoroughly, remove makeup and don't leave my face tight and dry. I haven't had any pimples, blackheads or any reason to touch my face since using these. Highly recommend.	&&&
love the products for my computer - trust product.	&&&
I noticed most of the bad reviews came from people who only tried the sample packets. I went ahead and ordered the 30 pack. I LOVE THEM! Cleans ALL my make up without leaving my skin dry at all. Also, used extensively around the eye area no burning whatsoever. I also liked that I didn't have to rub my eyes raw to get the makeup off!! Will buy again!	&&&
I'm a super neat freak. I gotta keep everything clean. Every night after dinner I wipe the whole kitchen down and with these it's fast and I know it's clean	&&&
Picked up some samples in the pediatrician's office. Thought the concept was gross, but my 6-year old liked it and requested I buy some for home. She used the unscented version during her next head cold and loved them. She felt cleaner after wiping her nose and never got the irritation that usually comes from using too many tissues.	&&&
best product ever to buy for the baby for all clean ups	&&&
I've used these wipes for two years and they WERE amazing and the best wipes hands down. Now, they are AWFUL! Why did you change them??? My hunt for the perfect wipe begins again.	&&&
Pampers make a great product and I would recommend the product to others.	&&&
Great value great price. I prefer using disinfecting wipes and this is a good price.	&&&
We always use it. It's gentle on our bottom and we also take it when camping or keep some in the car for spills.	&&&
They tear apart when using not very thick or durable	&&&
I never had a disinfectant that smells as good as a lemon just like this one. Aside from its amazing smell, another best thing about about this product that it kills 99% of microorganism living inside your house.	&&&
These are a must have in our bathroom and around the house.	&&&
Much softer than honest brand. Perfect for delicate skin!	&&&
I usually use bare minerals face wash, but there are nights when I'm too tired to wash my face but still need to take my makeup off. I used to use Aveeno wipes but then found these, and I love that after I wipe my face, it doesn't leave behind that extra oil that other wipes do. My face feels smooth and refreshed. Will definitely buy again.	&&&
i find Clorox wipes extremely convenient especially in the classroom and when doing woodworking projects.	&&&
Love the clorox wipes. They are convenient and smell clean and make my home clean for my family.	&&&
Clorox wipes are easy to use convenient , and disinfects great around my home.	&&&
These wipes aren't only for baby use. They are great for adults too. They have a clean fresh scent and leave you feeling soft and clean!	&&&
I have used Clorox wipes for years now. I find them easy and convenient for use especially with children and the messes they make.	&&&
thses are strong and powerful wipes that cut through grease and grime	&&&
This is a great price per wipe and they seem to stand up really well versus the Huggies wipes. I am sure I will be ordering these again in the future!	&&&
We bought a Costco membership just in order to continue to buy these, after a family member purchased them for us a few times. These are the ONLY wipes we use, and they are the best for cleaning ANYTHING.	&&&
These baby wipes are always with me – on my changing table, in the bathroom, in my car, in a purse. I am so get used to it, so I cannot leave my house without them. I use them in a bathroom always. But also they are my 1st must have when I go to the store to wipe my kid’s face and hands before and after sampling in Costco or Sams Club or to the playground or everywhere. Mommy's "must have in a purse" item. They are soft and gentle. Clean fast and easy. The clutch is p retty, comfortable, good quality. But I wish to see more “kids” prints on a clutch.	&&&
As a mother of two children and a dog, I need cleaning products that are convenient and that get the job done. These are wonderful wipes. I have one in every room :)	&&&
My husband and I both agree, that these wipes are the best! They are very sturdy and clean up any mess. I find myself using them for more than just my sons dirty diapers! :) Also they never break out from these wipes either! Makes this mom one happy one!	&&&
Very pleased with the Amazon Elements wipes & diapers!!! They are soft, strong & are packaged just right! A MUST on my subscribe & save items!	&&&
I really like these Clorox wipes. They are very convenient and easy to use. Wish I would have bought these along time ago."}},	&&&
Very easy to use. Great to use when my kids make messes!	&&&
I love to use these in the bathrooms. Especially on the toilet when you are tight for time.	&&&
Great product! good to use around the home. No nasty fumes that I can smell. Great way to do lite cleaning!	&&&
These are a staple in my home. Great for wiping countertops, toilets, you name it!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They smell great and leaves my home clean! Very convient as well!	&&&
I love the versatility and convenience of Clorox Wipes!! They are portable and I use them almost everywhere in my home!	&&&
We us clorox wipes all the time to keep our kitchen clean and to clean up messes after our pets.	&&&
"This week I have been lucky enough to review the Therma labs Glow2Go self tanning towelettes. I have always been the palest person in Western New York and so I am always looking to add color to my face, arms and legs. I have tried tanning booths (but do not like the health factor concerns with skin cancer etc.) and I have tried spray tanning which ended with me looking like a striped zebra. Nothing ever works. So, when I received these towelettes I was excited but leery to give them a try.

The 20 towelettes you will receive with your first box are 70% organic body cream formulated for all skin tones from the pale such as myself to olive or dark skin complexions as well. These towelettes do not require you to use a glove or use a spray, you simply take out the towelette and begin cleansing the skin. The product claimed to be 100% streak free and waterproof and I was curious about this as I have always ended up with streaks. When I used the product, I do not know if I would call it streaks but my arm around the creases and where my wrist is did seem to appear a different color or streaky. I think this was merely though my own lack of personal knowledge on using it, as the color of the tan was wonderful, a natural color, not the fake orange bake so many self tanners have.The tan showed up in less than 4 hours time and was very natural looking. I could see it looking amazing if you really knew how to work it around the hands and joints.

I enjoyed while after applying the product and waiting to get dressed that the tanner did not feel greasy or it did not feel sticky to the touch. I hate having lotions etc on my hands and this made it very simple and clean to use. I used two wipes for my arms and there was barely any scent at all as well, versus your other tanners that tend to have a stronger odor to them. Some not real pleasant smelling. I would compare the wipes here to that of a baby wipe.I have sensitive skin and can say that these were very gentle and did not give me any trouble.

The packaging of the product was wonderful. The box comes with an open here bottom so as to have a clean and organized towelette holder for the wipes in your closet or bathroom cabinet without having an open box and just multiple packages thrown about. The company offers a 100% money back guarantee as well that you will be pleased with your purchase. I think it is always commendable and worth mentioning when a product offers this type of commitment.

This product for a quick on the go pick me up for a self tanner is a HIT! I would recommend. I would just say be careful when trying to do your hands and creases like elbows and by your fingers. Other than that, a truly great product and definitely worth the $!!

Sold exclusively on Amazon.com!!"	&&&
"Great make up remover wipes! They become soft when wet & do a great job
of removing my (regular not waterproof) mascara & eye pencil without
having to use an oil-based make up remover. They clean up really easy
with a dab of my facial cleanser & a quick kneading under running water.
Looks like they last a while & its nice that 3 came in the package. I
would definitely buy these again! And I will see what other products this company sells because the quality of this item is superb!"	&&&
We use the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes all the time for our family	&&&
I even use this to wipe the floor around the sink where my daughters constantly spray their hair. The hair spray is very sticky on the floor and these wipes clean it so nicely.	&&&
I received a sample of these, and was not impressed. These did not remove any of my eye makeup. I will not be purchasing.	&&&
The smell of theses wipes is very strong. It also lingers for a long time. I would not recommend this product. It was so bad that I could not use them.	&&&
LOVE THESE WIPES ;) I USED THEM WITH MY FIRST DAUGHTER AND CHOSE THEM FOR MY 2ND DAUGHTER ;)	&&&
these wipes are so much better than huggies! we used to have so many problems with the huggies wipes they would always rip. since using pampers though we have not had any issues at all	&&&
Bought the camera for my grand daughter she was so excited then she used it for 1/2 hour and then it stopped working called the camera company and the said i had to be sent back for repair I took it back to Walmart and they gave me my money back but had no replacement cameras in stock	&&&
I'm very happy Gators AZ Store! I ordered this vacuum but due to some unexpected issues with packaging, I had to return it. They were extremely responsive, offering various options to ensure I was satisfied & my refund was issued quickly. Good service is hard to come by these days, but they got it right! I appreciate them making it a quick, easy process! I'd definitely shop with Gators AZ Store again!	&&&
to me it looks ok. but my sons skin is alergetic to it. coz of which stopped using them for now	&&&
I bought this for my baby and it works wonderful once you have the prince lion ever fresh pads it won't turn brown wonderful product.	&&&
I love this product and have only been able to find it at SAMs Club. It is so handy, effective, and leaves your hands feeling clean but not dry. A great buy.	&&&
What can I say this is a cleaning product that is green and or Eco friendly and yes I will buy again.	&&&
Love how they don't dry out like others and they smell amazing!!!	&&&
It's lightly scented and smell fresh. I like it because it's Chlorine free and contain little alcohol. Works good for me..	&&&
good price and u get more for ur money. packed good. came fast and quick. try the babywipes they are good price	&&&
Consistent high quality of pampers products, this is no exception	&&&
Highly recommend it to all parents. Good prices and good quality..	&&&
The fresh clean scent combined with the amazing cleaning power of Clorox is a powerful combination!	&&&
Great wipes for cleaning your bike on the fly….I bought them specifically for a AIDS LifeCycle 2014. The wipe holds up well for cleaning the entire bike. I only used them 1 time so far but am thoroughly impressed.	&&&
Great for my little one with allergies. He like that they are soft on his nose. The can also clean a messy face.	&&&
This is a great product. I use it on the go for the days I need to pump at school or at work and keeps my parts clean.	&&&
Sticky at first but then goes away as it dries. I use this on my palms, feet, underarm, underboob, thighs and sometimes I can get a swipe on my back from one wipe. They dry quickly once opened. Good for someone who doesn't sweat too much. Doesn't last all day.	&&&
It is easy to use. Clean every crack and crevice. Leaves the floor as dry as it was before it was washed. My first floormate lasted 5 years of heavy duty cleaning and I just got a new one. Giving the old one to a family member.	&&&
I live in lower Alabama where the humidity is so high and it's so hot at times with no wind blowing. I sweat like a crazy person...Lol...I have no one to compare to really!! It just rolls off of me and my face that I just got through meticulous putting makeup on looks horrible! I saw these and knew it sounded to good to be true. I moisturize my face first and then just gently dab the pad onto my face. I feel my face getting tight but nothing annoying. I DONT use under my eyes. I then use my foundation or BB cream and it's done. I still sweat but NOTHING if I don't use one of these pads. Upside as one of the other reviewers mentioned as well, you can save the pad and reuse there's that much liquid on the pad. This has been something I've been looking for my whole life, I'm 48. It's given me my self confidence back as to people would look at me in the summer months and ask me what was wrong due to the fact I wasn't doing a strenuous activity. As I'm writing this, I feel sooo strongly about this product that I'm sitting here with tears rolling down my face. THANK YOU DEREMADOCTOR!!!	&&&
This makeup remover was pretty good.	&&&
Very unhappy with the wipes!!! They say free n clear but from what??? They have CHLORIDE!!!! Now I have 12 packs!!! And to send back would cost more then the wipes!!!! What a waste!!!	&&&
I love this product cleans very well and great value	&&&
Love this product	&&&
They are small but they do the job that I purchased them for. The price is great and I am satisfied with my purchase.	&&&
use these to follow after wherever sick people went or items used. Cleaned everything. These did the job! Strong enough to fight virus but did leave my hands dry. Nice that they came in such a huge quantity we really needed it. Even took them in the vehicle whenever we went somewhere.	&&&
like amount in box, easy access, texture easy on baby skin, no harsh chemicals, cleans and protects without harm to area under diaper	&&&
I've been a science teacher for 29 years. I remember when white boards were invented! Trust me on this one, these are the best dry-erase wipes on the market and I've tried every other brand name."}},	&&&
Good quality. I will continue to buy these unless the price goes up significantly.	&&&
"I LOVE using these wipes! It keeps their nose from drying out. Love love love"	&&&
"I love these! I often need a refresher after my morning run and these work great. The little rubber exfoliators are very comforting and almost like massage your face when using them. They are pretty odorless but I love how they leave your skin so moisturized and soft. I would strongly recommend.

I received this item at a reduced priced in exchange for my honest review. Thank you."	&&&
yup...canned air, thats right...canned air. If you ever wanted to buy some quality air in a can, this is it.	&&&
I have tried other brands and always come back to these. They work great!	&&&
These wipes work effectively and really clear up my glasses lenses. I keep a few in my car, at home and at work. They do have a slight alcohol scent to them, which I don't mind (but some others might). Worth buying if you're a regular glasses wearer.	&&&
i love these wipes. They work great and smell wonderful.	&&&
Love these wipes! We have a new puppy and with stepping in mud along with everything else, these come in handy. Pup loves them a lot better then a wet paper towel and stand up to messes, even of the poopie variety.	&&&
Costco, please listen to your customers and go back to the old formula! The new formula smells terrible, burns, and leaves a slimey film behind. The old formula was by far the best on the market, and now I refuse to buy them. Be ware, these are NOT the same as the wipes that have primarily been reviewed on Amazon. Just look at the reviews on Costco's own site, they're terrible since the change. Stay away from these wipes!	&&&
So whenever I need to do a quick clean up I always grab my Clorox wipes, they are so handy and easy to use!	&&&
Love Clorox products. I have used Clorox products in my home for years. The wipes work really well in the bathroom. You will receive 3 large containers. I found that purchasing them thru Amazon is much more cheaper than purchasing them at one of the big box stores or your local grocery store.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! I use them for anything and everything!! ;-)	&&&
I use these wipes for anything and everything! From cleaning lunchboxes to walls. I can use just one wipe and get stuck-on food, grease, coffe stains and toothpaste out of and off of everything!	&&&
Clorox wipes are convenient, eas to use and make the bathroom look amazingle clean.	&&&
Love these wipes.	&&&
I love your products, the clorox wipes are a must have in our house! Does the job every time!	&&&
Great product,however I liked the texture of the wipes before they changed them.	&&&
1 dog, ex husband, and 4 kids. The wpies are a must, and make it simple to get the kids involved in cleaning.	&&&
Great wipes that don't leave your little one with a red bottom. I like that they don't have lots of crazy chemicals in them!	&&&
Working, running kids around, cooking, etc. etc. I need easy...Clorox wipes makes cleaning easy and I can be assured that it is disinfecting as well.	&&&
Love these wipes. I keep them on hand at work to keep the germs away.	&&&
I love the convencien of clorox wipes. i have them in almost all my rooms.	&&&
My baby can feel good using that wipes I really love it!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes daily in my home. They are great in the bathroom to easily and quickly clean toilets and countertops. I also use them in my kitchen to disinfect my countertops and to spot clean my floors! Couldn't live without this product!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes at work to disinfect my area after sick clients come in our office. They work great, are east, and smell great.	&&&
I rescued many animals. They all get sick its no surprise. Using the Clorox disinfecting wipes through out the place makes a huge difference! The clean up is easy and it always smells fresh when I am done.	&&&
Car, purse, every room in the house!Love the clorox wipes, carry them everywhere!	&&&
I really enjoy using Clorox products in my home. I use bleach, the toilet cleaner, and the wipes. I have used other brands but I always come back to Clorox because they are the best.	&&&
I don't have to worry whether or not it's really working. This is my immediate "go to" product when the kids come home sick. I use disinfecting wipes for everything. It is very convenient, easy to use, and leaves a wonderfully clean smell.	&&&
We only buy pampers wipes for our little one. They are very gentle and soft!	&&&
The wipes are great for quick cleaning jobs.& so handy! Love using them.	&&&
Bought these cloth wipes to save money on disposable wipes. Great investment! They're soft and fairly thick and only takes one of these to clean my baby's bottom opposed to 1-5 disposables in comparison depending on how big the mess is. A quick run in the wash and they're good to go again.	&&&
These baby wipes are always with me \u2013 on my changing table, in the bathroom, in my car, in a purse. I am so get used to it, so I cannot leave my house without them. I use them in a bathroom always. But also they are my 1st must have when I go to the store to wipe my kid\u2019s face and hands before and after sampling in Costco or Sams Club or to the playground or everywhere. Mommy's "must have in a purse" item. They are soft and gentle. Clean fast and easy. The clutch is pretty, comfortable, good quality. But I wish to see more \u201ckids\u201d prints on a clutch.	&&&
The package is handy. However, I found that the wipes tend to leave streaks after the dampening agent dries. I would expect a better result considering the cost of the product."}}];	&&&
While the color took a bit longer to show up for me, the color payoff is AMAZING! There is a learning curve for sure when you are using these wipes because you do not realize you missed a spot until hours later. If anybody has any suggestions, I would love to know because these are such a great item, I would love to use it for my wedding in October.	&&&
My daughter loves to use wipes after going on the toilet. They just clean a little bit easier when you are first learning. Flushable are terrific.	&&&
I am allergic to most hand sanitizers, as they contain aloe. This has NO aloe. It does, however, have a slight perfume odor, so be aware if you are perfume-sensitive. But this is a handy way to easily keep hand cleaners in your purse or satchel for effective germ-fighting. The packets are fairly small and flat, so I can easily slip 3-4 of them into my purse. The wipes open up to a nice size with ample moisture to completely clean adult (or child) hands.	&&&
Good deal for wipes. Some of them seem a little dry and will leave little dried off pieces when I wipe across the baby's bottom but overall, they are good quality and they get the job done	&&&
"These wipes are wonderful. The flip top lid closes securely and firmly every single time, ensuring the wipes stay moist down to the last one. The wipes are thicker and softer than cheapo brands, and I think are comparable to the high end brand we ordered before.

I guess we don't go through wipes as fast as Amazon thinks we should. We ordered 1 box 3 weeks ago (came with 6 packs of wipes), Amazon says that's a 1 month supply, but it's gonna last us 2 months."	&&&
Wipes are very easy to use. No wash clothes required. Can be used for a million messes.	&&&
I use the wipes daily at home and at the office. They are convenient, easy to use and get the job done. I don't have to worry about unsanitary wash clothes. These are perfect!	&&&
easy and fast to use in kitchen bathroom and pet mess	&&&
These work, however it takes several wipes to clean glasses. Noticable smears are left if you don't. Prob would not buy again.	&&&
The wipes are a fantastic, convenient idea but we have people in our home that have dealt with respiratory and skin irritation issues due to the ingredients still used in these wipes. Clorox did a good thing getting the bleach out, but we had to switch to a disinfectant that was botanical and non-toxic. And, sorry Clorox, the new product works equally well, is approved by the EPA, and creates NO side effects! Yea and halleluiah!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes daily to wipe down my counters, keyboard, door knobs.	&&&
I absolutely love the Pamper Sensitive Wipes. I love that they are soft, gentle and best of all...fragrance free!	&&&
LOVE THEM no streaks and no film or fuzz left on the mirror	&&&
The wipes arena as moist as I would like, (I usually use the Walmart brand), but the cost is great and my son doesn't break out into a rash. The 768 count comes with a free tub!	&&&
I love lemon Clorox desinfecting wipes. They are so easy to use and have a fresh clean smell. I love being able to just grab a wipe instead of getting out a rag and spray.	&&&
I love the CLOROX 2 and wipes the best. Not only so there disinfect but they get stains out after they have gone through the dryer,	&&&
I love this wipes they are hard to find so now I just come here Great price	&&&
Easy to use wipes clean up great after my two kids.	&&&
These wipes are the best! They don't smell weird, and don't tear (I have found that the Huggie's brand tend to tear). Have used them for all 3 babies. They also really stay moist (even if you leave the package cracked a little).	&&&
I love how easy these wipes are to grab and how great they clean.	&&&
delivered fast with no problems wipes work great for kitchen and bathroom cleanup	&&&
Fantastic product and I use it all the time for my cleaning.	&&&
I really like the Clorox disinfecting wipes lemon scent. They smell really nice and the are very easy to use.	&&&
This product is soooooo awesome for babies, kids and adults alike!!! Between my house and my Daughter's.......we're always stocked-up with these wipes!! They're so gentle, although so effective (even on the most irritated noses, after using those "other" gentle on your nose tissues!!) in that the saline that's contained in them, just helps loosen-up the nastiest (and you know what I mean!!) on and within the tiniest of noses!!! And the price is the best you'll find anywhere!!	&&&
Love these wipes! They're thick, soft, and work beautifully - I rarely need more than 2, even for the worst messes. I wash them with our cloth diapers, and keep them in an OXO Perfect Pull dispenser, wet with plain tap water.	&&&
Love these cleaning wipes, so easy to store and easy to clean up messes big or small	&&&
ITs a great item to use esp if you have pets and pet hair rags hold hair even after rinsing and the wipes you can just throw out and get a new one	&&&
Love he wipes easy to use streak free works great and easy cleanup"}},	&&&
They are essential in helping me maintain a clean bathroom and kitchen. I dont know what i'd do without them.	&&&
I really like using didinfectiong wipes with three kids these are very convinient.	&&&
these wipes are the best. my daughter has super sensitive skin and we have never had a problem with these wipes. My 5 and 6 year olds use them for quick clean ups when we are on the go too. They are also great for wiping down the car. Once in a while I make our own wipes to help save money, but when I need to buy some wipes, these are my first and only choice.	&&&
Wipes are very convenient and they get the job done when cleaning and disinfecting.	&&&
These wipes provide an easy way to keep my house clean!	&&&
These are seriously the best cleansing wipes I've ever tried. They remove makeup very quickly without much work to it. The container they come in keeps the wipes moist so they don't dry out. Very happy with these:)	&&&
I love the disinfecting wipes for kitchen counters. Easy to use and cleans well.	&&&
Love the convenience of cleaning with Clorox wipes. One quick swipe and you're done. I also love cleaning the exterior of the toilet with the disinfecting wipes. I clean with them and throw the germs and mess away.	&&&
I've read other reviews some are good some are bad. Well for me is good. Ive always love costco brands. And when i found this wipes im hook. The quality is good its not scented and its wide size and the price is good. Overall I love this product.	&&&
I love the smell. And how well they clean and diszzinfect.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes, super easy to use and they disinfect so well.	&&&
"Germ-X Soft Wipes were carried by our local SAM'S CLUB, however, not in stores in Virginia or North Carolina at this time. I found them online and had four boxes of 100 each sent for personal use at home and school use.
Order was filled and sent within one week. Excellent product and service. HDR
Teacher, Coach & Sports Official"	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best at cleaning up any small spills, wet or dry. Easy to use and helps me keep my home clean and disinfected.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the best! They truly are convenient, especially for mothers on the go.	&&&
Since I started using these wipes I have not had a sick day in over 3 years. I only wish the Sam's Club would carry them in their stores	&&&
I love these wipes. I used them for every day cleaning of appliances and counter tops. I take comfort in knowing they disinfect while making everything sparkle.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! I use them on everything! Even to clean the floors!	&&&
i love that the wipes are warm but, they do dry out quickly in the warmer	&&&
"This next product and topic is one that us Floridian's are going to love this time of year! This one is the best gift Santa could bring this season, a tan! This will be a 2 part review. I'll first talk about the different tanning options and then I'll review Thermalabs Glow 2 Go Self-Tanning Towelettes which I received a free box of in exchange for this honest review.

Part 1: Different Tanning Options Available: Pros & Cons of each one:

As a Floridian one of the most embarrassing things we could be missing is a beautiful tan! Unfortunately, this time of year makes it hard to keep up with that nice, even, bronze look we all love so much! So we have a few alternatives to using the good ol' sun to gain that glow! Some of the more popular solutions is to go to a tanning salon and use a tanning bed, another would be spray tanning (either self-done or at a business), and then there's all of the over the counter remedies such as self-tanning creams, milks, sprays, lotions, and wipes. Then there's not as popular options to gain and/or retain that sexy tan color such as sunless tanning pills.

Let's take a moment to look at the pros and cons to these options:

Tanning Beds:

Pros:
• You're able to obtain a beautiful bronze tan in a matter of minutes
• Most tanning salons are reasonably priced and even have frequent tanning specials and pricing.
• This option gives your skin Vitamin D just as the sun would.
Cons:
• Tanning beds still use the same UVA and UVB rays that can harm the skin and cause health risks.
• Since it uses the same rays it can promote and accelerate skin aging.
• According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Livestrong.com tanning beds can increase the risk of cancer.

Spray Tanning:

Pros:
• Is a convenient option; fairly quick, easy, and the results and immediate.
• According to Livestrong.com spray tanning is a safer alternative since it doesn't use harmful UV Rays! The chemical in tanning sprays is called DHA (dihydroxyacetone) and is approved by the FDA as being safe to use on the skin!
• Spray Tans allow for a beautiful even look which some other options are unable to provide.
Cons:
• Spray Tans do not protect the skin from sun rays, you would still need to protect your skin from the sun.
• You should be cautious not to breath in the Spray Tanning Chemicals because the DHA can cause health problems.

Over-the-counter Self-tanners:

Pros:
• Able to administer from the comfort of your own home without having to go to an often expense salon or spa.
• No UV Rays are used so it eliminates the chances of cancer or damaged skin from using these products to achieve a tan.
• Just like I mentioned with spray tanning, most self tanning products use a chemical called DHA (dihydroxyacetone) and is approved by the FDA as a safe product to apply to the skin according to Livestrong.com.
Cons:
• Many self-tanners make it difficult to achieve an even glow and can sometimes even leave streaks and discoloration of the skin.
• Can not protect against the Suns Rays and protection should still be used when outdoors.
• Some people can experience skin irritation and/or sensitivity from these products.

Tanning Pills:

Pros:
• The main ingredient in these self tanning pills is canthaxanthin, there is no DHA so it eliminates the risk of inhalation and the health issues associated.
• Like self tanning sprays and other products that use DHA, this product eliminates the use of UV Rays to achieve your tan which in turn eliminates the risk of skin damage and cancers.
Cons:
• Doesn't protect against sun rays and protection should still be used for protection.
• The FDA has not approved the use of canthaxanthin for tanning and has even issued warnings against using this as a tanning agent.
• Tanning pills (canthaxanthin pills) have been linked to cases of hepatitis, canthaxanthin retinopathy, skin and liver damage, and/or other health and medical issues.

Part 2: Thermalabs Glow 2 Go Self-Tanning Towelettes.

I've used self-tanning towelettes in the past and my experience wasn't all that great. For one the smell was just awful! During the process of wiping the towelettes on my skin it started to dry up and it was far from even! So I can honestly say I was skeptical, to say the least!! But, since I'm a Hispanic Floridian that has always had naturally tan colored skin and is married to a naturally pale country boy that somehow (from working outdoors), is currently tanner than me, I had to do something, and fast! When I was given the ability to try this product and review it, I decided this was not only perfect timing, but that I was perfect for the job!

I decided that it would be best to test this product on a small portion of my body first. I decided to use the wipe on just my left arm from elbow to wrist so that I could compare it with my right arm, since they were evenly the same color before using the self-tanning towelette it should be an accurate side-by-side. I followed directions as most consumers would by skipping them completely! Lol.. I took pictures of both my arms side-by-side before using the product. I then opened the towelette and wiped it over the entire area. I washed my hands very well, I remembered the other self-tanning towelettes leaving them yellow (even after washing them) and I didn't want to risk this product doing the same. It was pretty late at night so I allowed the product to dry (placed the towelette in a ziplock bag since I only used it on a small part of my body), and went to bed.

Before I go any further, I must say that I am normally more professional about testing products, I normally read the directions thoroughly, test the product and make a log of my findings, etc.. But, I was actually happy that I had acted like most consumers do with this product since it allowed me to a have a real life experience with this product and to explain my experience to readers that may use this product the same way I did initially, not necessarily following directions step-by-step. (Please note that I am not telling you to not follow directions and I am sure that my results would've been even better if I had followed exact directions, I'm just saying that many of us are so busy trying to get things accomplished that many times we skip a few steps.)

The next day, about mid-day it dawned on me that I had never gone back to see my results. I looked down at my left arm and I didn't even have to put them side-by-side to see the difference! It was beautiful, such a natural, glowing, bronze tan! I did end up putting my arms side-by-side and the results were amazing! The tan was even, no streaks, it was perfect! My hands were not stained at all and I was ready to do the rest of my body!

Here are some pros and cons I found while using this product:

Pros:
• Even tan, no streaks or discolored spots!
• No bad smells!
• Dried quickly which would allow me to continue on with a busy day while still getting my tan!
• Left behind a beautiful bronze glowing tan that looked natural.
• Works fast; be ready to go within 4 hours of application!
• Dries quickly, directions say to wait 10 minutes to apply clothing but mine dried way faster than that!
• Package includes 20 towelettes which is awesome since most come with half that for the same price!
• Extremely affordable!
• Has a Money-Back Guarantee!!

Cons:
• Wipes are white so you can see if your skin isn't 100% clean which isn't too appealing.
• Not easy to apply to certain parts of your body by yourself (but this would be a problem with almost all self tanners).
• Single-use, these aren't reusable but no self-tanning towelettes on the market are.

I would recommend following the directions on the box that are for a ""deeper tan"" and use another towelette after 4 afters to really get that ""I was at the pool all day"" look! This product, in my opinion, is one of the best self tanners I've ever used! I will continue to use it and would definitely recommend it to anyone!"	&&&
i love the wipes for a quick cleanup of small spills. It cleans and disinfects at the same time...win win	&&&
Having a toddler and 2 dogs I use Clorox wipes for everything!!! Its great for cleaning and disinfecting. I love knowing after I wipe things down around the house with Clorox wipes that everything is clean and germ free.	&&&
These are very convenient wipes. I like to keep one in my purse to freshen up when needed. The scent is very light. I will keep buying these for sure.	&&&
These are my #1 cleaning tool. Easy to use and always does the job! I can't remember life before Clorox wipes!	&&&
I love using the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes on my toilet. I am working on potty training my son, I keep a container beside the toilet which comes in handy often!	&&&
I absoloutyly have to have clorox wipes where ever I go! They keep me happy at home, the office, the car, and my childrens school!	&&&
I've been using these wipes since my daughter was born. They clean up very well and are extremely durable. I've been completely happy with them, they last a while and do the job perfectly. Best wipes out there.	&&&
Does the trick...cleans and soothes down there and does not contain parabens.	&&&
We have a really good experience with it	&&&
Great cleaning, a little greasy? feeling, but dries up fine. Good for sensitive skin.	&&&
It's very good	&&&
These are the only baby wipes we will use. They don't have that odd papery feeling that other brands do and don't dry out easily. This size box lasts us about three months.	&&&
these are great except not for toliets which is what I had wanted	&&&
A very easy way to clean your face. Works better than more expensive products	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They are very convenient and do A great job cleaning. I recommend them to everyone	&&&
agree with other reviews. the wipes smells bad. the wipe has a bit of a burn and sting to the skin. new packaging is bad. the opening rips and towels gets dried out faster. loosing confidence in kirkland products. starts out great and then goes down hill.	&&&
i love these wipes, use them in the kitchen, bathroom, floors for quick spot cleaning. especially great for the highchair!	&&&
My favorite wipes so far	&&&
"The wipes smell great and last a long time! They are the perfect moisture so that our cat didn't panic with the idea of something moist on her. We use to give her baths and she prefers this much more!

The scent is soft and long lasting. It's a great smell especially if your cat is affectionate like ours."	&&&
"They are great for quick clean ups. I like that they stay moist for a long time (months) as long as the lid stays closed. I sometimes use the liquid at the bottom after all the pads are gone before I throw it out. I keep one in the kitchen and one in the bathroom. It's very convenient.

Lysol wipes save cleaning time after the morning ritual or a making a quick snack when you just need to wipe up quickly and go. It's much better than using a new towel each time or using a possibly contaminated old towel/sponge for clean ups. They are stronger than a paper towel (I've never torn one, ever). I have to use more than one to wipe up a large counter top, but overall it's a great product.

The disinfecting power is hard to determine for me without research, but I am assuming that they are effective for household use.

The smell is kinda artificial lemony/limey smell. Not too bad, not too good. I pretty certain they don't use real lemon essence in the product."	&&&
These wipes are absolutely wondrful	&&&
This is a good value and helps us keep the wipes available in different locations. Good to keep the germs down this time of year."}},	&&&
Never fails to clean up a mess! Not on;ly do we use these wipes for diaper changes, but I carry them with me all the time and use them for every situation - spilt drink, cut knee, wiping away the tears! They are like my best friend they come everywhere with me!	&&&
We purchased the "sensitive" wipes for our little guy and they are really good. Comparable to name brands without the added cost or the strong smell. They are tough enough to handle our 3 month old's blow outs without having to use a ton of wipes. They also stay moist in the warmer, so no worries about them drying out like we've experienced with some other brands. We liked them enough to 'subscribe', would recommend.	&&&
I like them because they smell good and are easy to use for cleaning.	&&&
The only product I need to buy for kitchen and bathroom daily cleaning.	&&&
These are easy to use and help me to feel I can clean and disinfect all the germs that are around my house during flu season! I would reccomend them to any busy moms!	&&&
Like these- I was worried about the smell based on other reviews but I didn't find it too strong/unpleasant (and I hate perfumey stuff). More importantly, my kids (who didn't like my homemade alcohol and essential oil wipes) don't haveNy problem with these. I would recommend & am re-ordering them!	&&&
These wipes are handy for in a pinch when I need a little color. I wipe them on gently to avoid streaking.	&&&
None of the cleansing wipes do an amazing job with waterproof eye makeup, but this one does better than most. It also didn't irritate my sensitive skin and had a nice smell. Will definitely buy again!	&&&
These wipes would be perfect for even the most sensitive of skins. They have little to no scent. They leave baby fresh and clean.	&&&
very easy to use but would like to see more scents	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes. They disinfect and clean without leaving a film.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. Easy and quick to use and I love that I can help keep germs out of my house!	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for any occasion! With 2 kids under the age of 3, I use them on a daily basis, especially in the kitchen.	&&&
"I received a complimentary product from the manufacturer.

I get nervous whenever I decide to try self tanning products, results can vary dramatically, and if those results aren't good,... well then you're stuck with them until they fade away. The most horrible, orangey, splotchy, streaky, hide your head in shame type bottled tan will always, ALWAYS be the tan that lasts the longest too.

What I have decided I like about these self tanning wipes is they start you off with a nice light bit of color, being fair skinned I like that because it's easier for me to control where, and how much color I want. These are so simple to use too. After about 4 hours you will be able to see if you want to go a bit darker and can apply another application if you like, then apply again about once a week to keep the color from fading.

You get a box of 20 individually packaged tanning towelettes, perfect for vacation time! No mess with these towelettes either, unlike the traditional bottle or spray method. The towelettes are like wet wipes and aren't greasy or sticky, very easy to apply evenly. Wait 10 minutes before getting dressed, and make sure you wash your hands after applying. This has been the simplest self tanning product I have used!"	&&&
Typically prefer Clorox brand wipes but the Lysol gives better selection and different scents. I ordered the Lysol instead of Clorox for that reason."}}];	&&&
This works much better than the generic or store brand and it smells better too!	&&&
Love, love Clorox wipes. Helps me feel confidant I am effectively cleaning and disinfecting at the same time!	&&&
Love to use the Clorox wipes. Very easy to just grab and wipe. I always have them handy in the washroom, laundry room and kitchen.	&&&
Having these Clorox wipes on hand means I clean more often. I'm not sure what it is about them since I could just as easily spray a paper towel and clean. But I love having these on hand to do a quick cleaning of the bathroom counter and toilet.	&&&
We tried generics. But they left a film all over what we "cleaned". Never again. Clorox wipes are the only ones for us.	&&&
Excellent cleaner for non carpeted floors; good suction vac leaves them nearly dry. Lightweight, easy to fill and empty.Nice long cord: my only wish was that the "hook" for curling up the powercord was higher on the handle. Our last one died abruptly when still fairly new, but we liked it enough to try again.	&&&
My family LOVES these wipes. We love the fact that they are natural and better for our baby boy. They smell amazing, as well. We always pick up a few big boxes whenever we are in need- they last a long time and it only makes sense to have them on hand at all times.	&&&
Great at cleaning up a lot of messes and works on different surfaces. My child does not get rashes and her skin is sensitive	&&&
Of all the brands I've tried - these wipes are my favorites. I don't buy any other kind.	&&&
Very good and easy to use. Just keep in your purse and use on the way home. I keep mine in the fridge and they are so refreshing .	&&&
This is a staple in our house and the deal we received from Staples was fantastic. The convenience of use and disinfecting properties of this product insures our home meets the high cleanliness properties required by my wife in both the kitchen and bathroom . The citrus blend combo pack is also a plus. The price of the three pack convinced me to make a bulk purchase. Price and prompt delivery by Staples has gotten me into the habit of reviewing all Staples weekly and daily sale items."}},	&&&
This is the best deal we have been able to find online or in stores. The Pampers wipes are the best and we love them! We participate in subscribe and save. It is so convenient and easy for a new mom!	&&&
Quite simply the BEST product to clean our stainless steel kitchen appliances. We have tried many things, and this product is very easy to use-- and one wipe takes care of our entire (very large) refrigerator. Some other reviews mentioned that they have to clean the appliance first and the use the wipes, but I don't find that to be true at all... unless of course the appliance is exceedingly dirty. I do see that the price isn't that much better than buying them at the grocery store, but not a lot of grocery stores carry this item. However, if you have Amazon Prime, it's an add-on item with free shipping, so it's conveniently delivered to your door. Either way, I highly recommend this item-- and we are very picky!	&&&
These are just like Huggies!	&&&
Use on toddler to clean hands/face	&&&
I always buy Simple. My daughter in law introduced me to this product 2 years ago and I haven't used anything else since. It's gentle, cleansing, and doesn't dry my skin out. I love Simple Skin Care.	&&&
Use this for my glasses, my tv, my computer, and anything else with a screen! Great product!	&&&
"I love the product because it gets the job done! A good bang for your buck. I don't really care for Huggies wipes or Pampers. For some reason the generic brands appeal to me better and texture wise it's better for my babies' bums. Lol :p
It works and that's why I buy them."	&&&
Love them for the grandkids toys, highchairs, and changing tables.	&&&
tHESE wipes are packaged very nicely and are easy to carry - I like them very much"}},	&&&
Love the Pampers sensitive wipes for my twins. They are super soft and gentle on their little bottoms.	&&&
With Flu season in full force, I enjoy having the clorox wipes on hand to assist in disinfecting any nasty bugs that make their way home. They are the flu go to favorite in my house	&&&
Love the disinfecting wipes. Easy to use and gets the job done.	&&&
Best wipes for my baby boy sensitive skin. They dont cause any rashes, it cleans very well. If your baby has sensitive skin these are the best!	&&&
These wipes really don't wipe anything away. Was not impressed by them at all.	&&&
These are certainly the best natural baby wipes available.	&&&
Fantastic for those stuck on crusty boogies that dont want to let go. My cousin turned me onto these wonderful little wipes and it makes the job of nose control so much easier. Would recommend to anyone who deals with crusty/stuck on mucus (also found they are good for eye boogies too)	&&&
"The Glow2Go wipes come in an easy to dispense box. You can tear out the side and just remove one wipe at the time. The wipe is also a smaller size than other tanning towelettes so it will not dry up by the time you reach your last part of your body and besides what if you want to just tan your legs and arms only.
This is coming from someone who has never self tanned before. I was very scared, cause I have seen some pretty terrible self tanning results. I watch a lot of You tube videos and even the most experienced self tanner makes mistakes and have the oompa loompa results unintentionally. I have also heard that ""wipes"" don't work. In a way I was happy about that since this was going to be my first experience with self tanning.
Let me mention I have used ""fake"" tanning lotions which wash off once you get in the shower and I have like the few I have tried, but it is a one day kind of thing. It is a bit time consuming to apply it every single time you want to wear shorts, but have endured the time consumption due to the fact I am scared of flubbing up my self tan. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions."	&&&
The only complaint I have is that these are not consistently on Prime for the $11 price point. These wipes do the job with no crazy smell.	&&&
Love the convenience and efficiency of the Clorox wipes!	&&&
Of course these are good wipes, but mine arrived with leaking all over the package. They need to figure out a way to ship these in tact.	&&&
Great product! I have dogs and Clorox wipes make life so much easier.	&&&
The product is great but the package was broken when it arrived. I had to put all the wipes in a bag	&&&
Love these! I know its clean when I use these wipes.	&&&
Great to have in my gym bag for after class. They are large enough to wipe my whole body, pleasant clean scent, does not leave any kind of film on skin. Wipes the sweat off so that I can change and go run errands before showering.	&&&
"Need your work surface cleaned and disinfected in a jiffy? Just reach for your handy tup of Lysol Dual Action Disinfecting Wipes and whip one out! They clean up fast and kill almost every germ that might be lurking on your table top, computer board, arm chair or plastic seat. Useful in your kitchen area, work area or bathroom area and, as long as you keep the snap lid securely snapped shut, you'll have a reliable cleaning tool at your finger tips for a long, long time. The only potential drawback is the strong citrus-y odor: for some of us it's the aroma that tells us something is sparkling clean but for others it might be a tad too strong."	&&&
I am a current college student and i LOVE clorox wipes they are so convenient for a quick clean of the dorm room between classes!	&&&
use it all the time-espically now with all the flu bugs going around used on the table at one of my resturarants with my freind	&&&
sandy 64... I have 3 dogs and a 4 year old grandson Clorox wipes are awesome cleaning up after them.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great especially during cold and flu season. They're pre-moistened, so it makes it easy to pull out a sheet and go to work. I use them on counter tops, the fridge and microwave door handles, and any surface that is touched by many hands (door knobs, light switches, etc.).	&&&
The product is exactly what I wanted. These wipes smell great, and work great. My only disappointment was I thought they were in smaller prepackaged packs with a lid. If I had known they were in the large bulk sizes I would not have bought this size I would have bought two of the bigger boxes. It did not say refills on the outside of the packaging like the larger box had on it. It should've been clearly marked refills.	&&&
The wipes were a little dry in my opinion. I had to use two wipes on a lightly tarnished bracelet.	&&&
I buy these wipes over your competitors for the simple reason that it's "Clorox." They're the best. The name says it all. I know I will always get an amazing product.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes because they are so easy to use and convenient. They smell good too! And I know they leave my surfaces clean of germs.	&&&
(Wife's review) Soft and the fragrance isn't too strong. I'm not sure if it is an older lot or they have been sitting on the shelf too long, but some of my wipes were dried out near the top and were soaked at the bottom...shake 'em up! I'll be honest, I do like the Pampers sensitive wipes better, but these are still really good and the same price.	&&&
I use Cloro wipes for everything. I love the scent and how it disinfectants everything	&&&
I love the product. I purchased a bunch of them just for my car for long trips with children	&&&
Like this product. It works well. Use them for everything!	&&&
Feel so much better using these wipes on my baby then the other wipes on the market. Safest wipe per EWG.org. Highly recommend this product to family and friends	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are easty to use and they get the job done. They cut grease and are great to use in the kitchen, bathroom, and anywhere else that needs cleaning/disinfecting.	&&&
My baby isn't born yet and I keep these around anyway. They don't dry out even after a couple months. They're great to have on hand as flushable wipes for adults. I take them with me whenever I travel and use them for everything. They don't have a very strong fragrance, which I like, and they don't leave any residue which is my favorite part. I'll be using these in a couple of months on my baby.	&&&
I love how well these wipes clean, and i love the scent.	&&&
For the number of wipes it's a good reasonable price!	&&&
Its a must have product and works very well for cleaning your baby during a diaper change. Wetness of these wipes are just enough not to leave much water on the skin whereas cleans well without leaving any rashes.	&&&
These wipes work great. They are very moist and easy to pull out and use every time. The smell is nice and not offensive.	&&&
Love this travel wipe dispenser. It's thin and fits in the side pockets of my diaper bag very well. It only fits a certain amount of wipes so I just refill as I go. Not like other travel dispensers, this one is sturdy and all the open and close buttons snaps into place so my wipes never go dry. Hightly recommend this.	&&&
Love the disinfection wipes awesome to use when you are on the go.	&&&
I have used a number of different brands of wipes, these wipes are nice and thick. I feel that I do not have to use so many. Something my daughter and I both enjoy. I would definitely recommend these wipes to friends!	&&&
clorox is great I use it everyday for messes my dirty kids make !	&&&
"got these on sale. usually dont purchase wipes, just use spray with paper towels, but thought i would try these. for the price on sale it couldnt hurt. they smell great. they are a bit small, but for quick jobs it didnt matter much. i havent found them to dry out in the bottle, but what I did find was that they are a bit difficult to get out. you are supposed to pull up thru an area where they stay, but when i pulled i got more than one and they all got stuck. so now i just pull out from the center and rip off exactly what i need. i will watch for these on sale again in the 3 pack."	&&&
I am a bit of a germaphobe and especially with my kids I worry about them getting germs. The wipes are so easy to use and I trust the clorox name that it is actually disinfecting what I wipe down. I take them camping with us and there are some in my diaper bag because restaurant highchairs and grocery store carts are a breeding ground for kid germs.	&&&
This is perfect for quick clean ups and sanitizing. I can't go without clorox wipes!	&&&
These wipes are extremely easy to use and can always get cooking stains off of my stove top and counter top very easily! I also use them to get stains out of my tile floor from the kitty litter box. Luckily, these smell great so I enjoy using them.	&&&
We debated doing cloth wipes for a few reasons- $ and environment. We took the plunge we we just couldn't get rid of our daughter's diaper rash and we couldn't be happier. We used to go through so many wipes during a changing and now we just use one cloth to do the job. These cloth wipes are so soft and hearty.We soak them in a solution and then put them in a wipe warmer, it's been the perfect combo for us.	&&&
Not really impressed with the product. Very hard to open. ended up just putting a hole in the silver lining and pulling one wipe through. Then to pull the next one, it bunches up - comes out torn, ragged, Cloth seems a bit wetter than it should be. It leaves a film or wetness across the surface - more than usual wipes do. It was also the most expensive product ion that department - I am disappointed because I went with the more expensive one thinking I was getting one of more quality. I will not purchase again."}},	&&&
I like using Clorox wipes because they clean well and can be thrown away.	&&&
This product is great for wiping up spills and great for the classroom also.	&&&
I love having these disinfecting wipes. With kids in the house, it makes it easy to clean up all kinds of messes.	&&&
"Pros:
Organic Cotton
Soft on baby bottom
Nice size (only one wipe needed usually per change)
Great absorption

Cons:
I don't have any

Don't forget to prewash for great absorption. I pre-washed with my prefold diapers and they worked perfectly. Will be buying a lot more!"	&&&
Fine.	&&&
I love these wipes. Perfume and alcohol free, of course and thicker than a flannel wipe. Very soft terry cloth. I haven't had a problem with fraying edges after washing like others have. I purchased 2 sets and throw them in the wash with my dirty OS cloth diapers. The perfect accompaniment for cloth diapering mommas.	&&&
I use t every night,before I cleanse my face.	&&&
This product does an excellent job cleaning stainless steel items	&&&
Expensive, but you can really feel that ur using a natural product! the smell seemed strong at first. but it was a clean smell. I only buy this when my budget allows. Overall, it's close to perfect, except for the price.	&&&
I had an appointment to get my makeup done in store at Sephora but had to run some errands prior to the appt. I sweat a lot from my face and it was embarassing because the woman couldn't start my makeup b/c my face was so sweaty. She used 1 of these on me and not only was I swear free for the rest of the day it helped my makeup stay put. I do not recommend for heavy duty use on the face as it will start to make your face overly dry. Still it got the job done. Totally recommend. :)	&&&
Loved the softness and strength but comparing to the Natural Clean wipes I prefer Natural Clean. The only difference I see is that I get to clean more and faster with Natural Clean but both have the softness that baby needs.	&&&
favorite wipes! others are to hard and don't clean as great. will continue to buy!	&&&
I am a pediatric speech pathologist and when I first started practicing speech pathology 13 years ago, we used to soak all of our plastic toys in a solution that was 1 part bleach and 3 parts water. These cleaning towelettes have revolutionized the way I clean toys and made it so much easier. My kids love buying garage sale/thrift store toys and there is nothing that comes through my house without getting a good wiping from these things. We completely avoided a very bad flu season and I attribute that to these guys. Since it is bleach I need to clarify that, while it does clean well, it is not for kids' reach. I had a kid try to wipe his nose with it and saw a man use one of these as a wet wipe to change a diaper. Not without a lecture from me. That is not what this is for so proceed with caution.	&&&
these actually clean... unlike some they will not slide across the skin. it will actually grab and clean. well worth especially on subscribe and save	&&&
Although not as good as the regular Clorox this all natural version still is a winning combination of ease and that fantastic Clorox cleaning ability. The thing i like about the wipe version of this cleaner is the ease it brings. I have them all over my house in every room and they are convenient and easy to get to. The fact that they are already moistened makes using them simple and fast and the wet cloth makes cleaning up dry stains and dry messes really easy.	&&&
these wipes keep my son very clean and smelling great	&&&
I'm not very experienced cleaning my jewelry, but these worked well to get most of the tarnish off. Overall happy with the purchase.	&&&
"I've used many other wipes and thought this would be better but the ones I had been using from cvs were better. These seem to smudge more than not. The paper used seem to be less softer than the others I have used. I have two thirds of these left, I went back to the cvs brand.
I am not pleased with these wipes. They are just okay."	&&&
These smell so good and make your baby smell like well, a baby! Great for use on anything!	&&&
These are my favorite by far. Love them along with the diapers for sensitive skin.	&&&
"After surgery a few years ago, I discovered that Huggies wipes are great for quick freshen-ups. I have been using Huggies Cucumber & Green Tea wipes and they are great. I decided to try the Natural Care wipes and .... OUCH! They sting.

I feel sorry for little babies whose mothers use Natural Care. I'm going back to Cucumber & Green Tea."	&&&
these are great for getting off tough stuff and leave the skin smelling great.	&&&
My German Shephard pup growed out of these so fast that I didn't get to try them much and what time he did have them on he was trying to chew them off. I was desperate to try something until he could get house trained. Good luck!	&&&
We love these for our twins. I love natural products where you don't need to worry about a ton of chemicals. Work great! Sensitive too!	&&&
Overall it gets the job done that much I like, however, i feel like that it is sort of messy. When you first take a wipe out it feels super wet then within a wipe or two and it is dry leaving most of the moisture on the counter. So I just wipe thru it to spread the moisture a bit to clean the rest of the are which is usually not very big. I like that it disinfects but it does worry me that on the bottle it says to wash hands after use. This is something that is suppose to clean your house or whatever you use it for not having to wash after using it. Makes me wonder if i need to wipe after it with a wash cloth or something because if it is not safe for my hands then it wouldn't be safe for my kids to touch the area I wiped or to prepare food on that area. I am a little mixed on this product, I like that it disinfects it just worries me on how it can harm my family and I. One thing i do like about the packaging is that it is convenient to use.	&&&
I have been using Boogie Wipes on my daughter since she was about six months old. These are much better on little noses (or anyone's nose) than tissue. "	&&&
I bought these a couple of weeks ago and I love them. They leave my face clear of makeup (the wipes are very soft, which I appreciate), smell amazing, and leave me feeling refreshed. I like these better than the grocery store brands I've tried.	&&&
My cat was ill and not grooming herself. She HATES baths so this seemed worth a try. She tolerates being 'pet' with the wipes which are damp, not wet. It does a GREAT job! I'm sold on this product.	&&&
I have been carrying Wet Ones Hand Wipes in my purse for years. My decision of purchase from Amazon is based on value.	&&&
These wipes were perfect to have while we were road tripping from North Carolina to Wisconsin. I was able to pump, then clean everything right in the car while driving! Also great for camping!	&&&
I love these wipes. They clean up boogies really well. I have a toddler that is always smearing his runny Boogies all over his cheeks and if I'm on the road they will dry up, baby wipes won't dissolve it the way these wipes do and they are gentle on the nose and face. I always have a pack of these in my purse. Specially in the winter, or if u have kids with allergies, they are a must have.	&&&
I don't know if I'm doing it wrong because the only instructions are "wipe with circular motion, rinse with warm water, and buff with soft cloth to shine"..... if I still have to buff it, what is the point of the wipes???	&&&
I ordered these to put into the gift bags for my guests that are coming in from out of town for my wedding. They arrive just as described in the listing and shipped really quickly.	&&&
What can I say this is a cleaning product that is green and or Eco friendly and yes I will buy again.	&&&
I used to use Huggies Natural, but just switched to these they are just as great. I will continue to use these.	&&&
This is a high quality product that is well suited for cleaning up messes as well as disinfecting counter tops.	&&&
"I've been a science teacher for 29 years. I remember when white boards were invented! Trust me on this one, these are the best dry-erase wipes on the market and I've tried every other brand name."	&&&
I think pampers are the best. They are soft and hold a lot of poo and pee. They also do a good job absorbing and keeping baby dry.	&&&
I loved the smell. My daughter has sensitive skin never had an issue with these.	&&&
My review is about the container this product comes in. The designs were pretty so I bought 2 for my bathrooms. Unfortunately the lids do not stay closed and therefore the wipes dry out between uses. Very disappointed.	&&&
Don't buy any other, this is the best, plenty of fluid in the packet and removes all kinds of glue, I use it for lots of stuff, like getting decals off cars. Anytime you have left over adhesive this works great, better that carb cleaner, or disc brake cleaner. Plus it is very mild on the skin Great stuff	&&&
Have to use every day and brush, have oriental cats who don't shed a lot. No bad smell, totally safe, wish they were a little larger, still my favorite product, kind of expensive. Make sure to close good so they don't dry out. Have tried a few other brands. These are the best.	&&&
After doing extensive reasearch on the best natural baby products, I am very pleased with purchasing these wipes. They arrived very quickly, and we noticed right away how great they smelled. They have a very nice fresh, light scent, and when we were sampling them (I wiped my arm, my husband wiped his face), we both noticed how strong and durable they are, too. They do not leave much of a scent behind, they seem to be the perfect level of 'wetness', and they are not soapy and do not leave behind any residue. I am sending a pack to my friend, who is due with baby #3 in a few weeks, just to show her how great they are!! I am very confident these will be the only wipes we will ever use!! Thank you, Clearly Herbal, for such a wonderful product!! Please don't ever change!	&&&
These are great for fast clean ups. Make up removal is plus. Keep them in all our bathrooms. Just the right amount of moisture & cleansing. We use them for all kinds of cleaning. Gentle & kind for babies & adults!	&&&
"I like it. It works great. Hopefully it will not dry out to soon."	&&&
Love these for keeping germs from virus' from making my family sick. If they're good enough for medical facilities, they're good enough for my family.	&&&
"The product performs as expected, but you cannot fish the towels through the dispensers' feed hole without breaking off. In order to use the product, you must take off the top and unroll it piece by piece."	&&&
I love Kat von d products but not these. They burned my eyes so bad and broke out my skin. I had to throw them away and a waste of money.	&&&
I have a hard time finding these, but they work so well. All those stickies. UGGG pain to get off, but not with these.	&&&
Really like these cloths, hold their shape well with washing. Also release stains well and are very soft and gentle.	&&&
I love osocozy! I use their prefectfit prefolds! Thought I would live these! Nope! They are very thin! & after a couple washes the fabric starts to ball up! Wouldn't purchase again!	&&&
My go to wipes. Great scent, soft, thick enough!!!!!	&&&
These are the same wipes used in the hospital but smaller. So glad Amazon has them available! These are great for sanitizing items that need more than just bleach.	&&&
Took on a vacation to San Diego - they did the job!	&&&
Well this is an obvious - I've used pampers products for all my kids and they are still a quality company.	&&&
They do not work properly... They left streaks on everything did not clean glasses at all. They may be outdated	&&&
Wipes are very thin and stick together. Very hard to separate. Bought because they were cheap. Definitely not worth it.	&&&
These are gentle on our kids' bums and smell great. They are much more durable and soft then other wipes we've tried.	&&&
Can clean up to 2 pairs of glasses per wipe. Also works for iPhone glass. No steaks. The wipe does dry out quickly once you take it from wrapping, wipe fast.	&&&
Only wipes that work for my little one	&&&
Quick easy way to clean your face. Traveling, late night, removes water proof eye makeup. Non drying . Always have some on hand.	&&&
I have these wipes in every room in my house. They are great for a quick clean up when needed.	&&&
The best wipes ever! Can be used at work, home or even in the car!	&&&
You know at first I thought these were the most ridiculous thing. I figured, I could just use a wipey or some tissue. That was until I received them as a gift. I loved that they are so soft on sensitive little faces. They smell wonderful and they were so convenient to have. I like these little packs but when I bought more ended up just buying the big tub of them. They even work well when they dry out. Still nice and soft on the skin.	&&&
Great product. This makes it easy to use and smells great.	&&&
OMG everyone was sick and I did eveything I could do to stop spreading the germs, these wipes helped so much. I was wiping door nobs phones, sink handles and everything else where others where handling and we are alive and well. Lol!!!	&&&
These are the BEST lens wipes out there. I've tried many other brands but they either have too much wetness and leave spots or have lint leaving debris on the lens. I will NEVER buy any other brand but these!	&&&
These wipes are the only thing my daughter will tolerate when she has a runny nose. They are SO soft and don't irritate like regular tissues do. We love them!	&&&
Easy clean up, especially when you have kids. Cleans up very sticky messes using just one wipe. I would recommend these to everyone. Very convenient for at home or in your vehicle.	&&&
The wipes are a good, solid product. The scent is great and makes everything seem extra clean. I like knowing I can trust Clorox to disinfect!	&&&
Love it. Cleans what I need and fast! Fast is what I need having two boys running around.	&&&
I use this product in my household on a daily basis. easy to use and cleans up every mess.	&&&
"Handy item to use for runny noses or to wipe off the spaghetti coated face. A regular baby wipe doesn't go over well with my child and she prefers Boogie Wipes. A must have in the diaper bag or backpack!"	&&&
Love these wipes. Been using them for 1 1/2 years for my daughter and can't find anything that would come close to these. They are large and moist. But not soaked like some other brand of wipes.	&&&
I love this product. It works great and smell wonderful. I used it all the time on quick clean up jobs. Thanks for a great product.	&&&
I love this product is very good and powerful cleaning and smells very well and very easy to use. ....	&&&
I used to buy baby wipes by the individual box but these are such a great value. I can't believe the price. Much less than buying them one box at a time. Its also nice because they're delivered to your door so you don't have to lug it home. They are as good as any baby wipe out there. I'll never go back to buying them one at a time.	&&&
I love clorox because it is so easy to use and smells awesome. I KNOW that it is really cleaning.	&&&
Love Them -- Keep them at my desk so I don't bring home work cooties!!	&&&
Favorite wipes by far!	&&&
I love these. Way better then baby wipes. Nice clean scent. No residue. Perfect thickness. Compact package	&&&
I use Clorox Wipes in my kitchen every day. I feel like the wipes are easy to use but they disinfect a lot. A must have for all households!	&&&
These were the wipes used in the NICU for my preemie son, so of course I didn't want to stray from what he'd already gotten used to. They worked fine for the first few months, but as he got older and his poops got messier, these wipes weren't cutting it. I found that I was having to use too many to get him all cleaned up. In the beginning, it's good to have a wipe as soft and gentle as these. However, now that he's not nearly as delicate, I prefer a sturdier wipe that i s more of a one-and-done product.	&&&
Love the smell. Cant go wrong with a Clorox product in disinfecting.	&&&
I used these on my daughter who has a sensitive bottom and they worked great. I loved these wipes!!	&&&
After trying other wipes, these are the ones I go back to. I can't stand the other brand ones that feel slimy. Huggies makes wipes that are thicker and you don't feel all the poop you're wiping off. With my first baby I tried wipes on myself, because I was afraid that with my gentle skin, we would have irritation problems.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes cause theyre easy to use with kids around just wipe and throw away!	&&&
I love how easy the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are to use. I use these wipes to clean off all my counters and even use them at work and in my car!	&&&
Love the wipes. Maintains moisture while cleaning and smells great!	&&&
Clorox is the best to use for disinfecting, deodorizing and cleaning!!!	&&&
I like how easily the Clorox wipes clean spots and stuff off the counters and surfaces. The smell of them is usually okay but sometimes a little chemically. I do wish they wouldn't make the skin on my hands feel as weird as they do. Thanks.	&&&
i absolutely love love love the clorox wipes!! easy to use and very effective!	&&&
These are great quick face wipes for a quick refresh after work and if you are too tired to fully wash your makeup off before bed. Great for traveling too.	&&&
My son has sensitive skin and these wipes have been great to use on him. Very soft and work well!	&&&
Clorox is a great brand the wipes are perfect to use.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes. They make cleaning easy. So much so that my kids love to help wipe down the tables and counters in our home.	&&&
We had to switch from the pampers baby fresh scent wipes to these because my kids have such sensitive skin! They work great, and helped reduce the amount of rashes my kids got (due to sensitive skin). I use them to wipe their faces and hands as well! Only wipe we will ever use!	&&&
I love these wipes! Makes cleaning/disinfectng fast and easy!	&&&
Extremely handy. I just wish they were a little wider.	&&&
These were durable, stretchy, and gentle on sensitive skin. I did feel like they had a slight unpleasant odor. Even my 2 year old comments about it every time I use them on her. My biggest complaint was the package. I bought these since they come in smaller packages, but the seal on them was terrible. It would rip the bag upon re-opening each time, and not stay sealed until the next use. Because of this, I had many wipes dry out and were wasted.. Bummer!	&&&
I love the Pampers Baby Fresh wipes. The smell is so nice and they do a great job cleaning baby	&&&
These do a great job of cleaning silver jewelery without harsh chemicals or stink. One sheet will last through several pair of earrings and the size makes them easy to get into small spaces. I kept one package and used the other for a gift with a pair of silver earrings. The old design was a pop-up canister, I like this much better.	&&&
They were not wet enough to clean. They were just damp. Not happy with them. I wonder if all pampers wipes are like this!?	&&&
Clorox products are all great, but the convenience of the wipes is just unbeatable!!!!	&&&
Not fond of the smell (and it's a smell, not a scent), but it does the job and EWG says it's less unhealthy than your standard wipes, so I'll stick with it.	&&&
These sanitizing wipes have been a god send for winter. Germs are everywhere, but I can easily disinfect! This container is WAY bigger than I thought it would be... I may never run out! I received these from Softy for review, and I'm quite happy with the product.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because I get sick often and have a toddler. It's quick and easy to wipe all our surfaces down until I get better to do deep cleaning.	&&&
I really love these and I'm so glad I found them. They have caused no irritation to my newborns skin. I only wish they were designed like other wipes in that they brought the next wipe up as you pulled one out.	&&&
Love these wipes! Use them at least twice a day for everything!	&&&
It removes make up very well. But it stings my skin a little bit. It may be due to I have sensitive skin. I only use it for nights when I have a lot of make up on, I mainly only use baby wipes. Also be warned. Do not use while apply makeup (like fixing mascara mistakes) every time I did this after I would blink the mascara or eyeshadow would mess up. The oil stay on your skin. So I recomend baby wipes for that job.	&&&
Like to you clorox wipes bc they are convenient and easy	&&&
Great to keep the bathroom clean between cleanings. I have men in he household so it keeps down odor and little drips	&&&
Fast easy and effective. Wouldnt use any other brand.	&&&
I love how easy and convenientertainment the wipes are. It makes cleaning effortless.	&&&
We use Lysol disinfectant wipes at home & at my grandchildren school. Great & convenient product.	&&&
Having two boys in diapers, newborn and toddler, I have to clean up quite a few messes. These wipes do not tear nor are they as thick as Huggies, which I find difficult to wipe with. This is my wipe of choice.	&&&
It's so easy to clean up day-to-day messes with these wipes! They're a great go-to cleaner!	&&&
"These are the smaller cartons of wipes-just an FYI. In my head, they were larger-I must have been thinking I was ordering a bonus pack. Got them on sale so I'm not complaining. Smell lemony fresh-are truly all purpose whether you're wiping a bathroom or a kitchen down."	&&&
I love using these wipes and have a canister in every room of the house. Also very convenient when on the go.	&&&
I love that I can use these wipes to clean every mess and they do a fantastic job. I love that they disinfect to protect my family from germs!	&&&
I really like the smell of Clorox when you walk into a room. It tells me it has been cleaned and disinfected..The smell of Clorox is a staple in my home	&&&
I have always been a Clorox fan, especially since I got married and am now a mom-to-be. It will definitely come in handy for messy spills and stains! :)	&&&
I like using the wipes, they disinfect and are very convenient.	&&&
Just a wonderful product.. buy the bigger containers..they stay fresh longer	&&&
I used this product for two weeks and the lid does not close properly now.. It will open on its own and hence the wipes dry out or become cold..I'm not happy with the product as the lid is defective	&&&
I love having the Clorox wipes handy! As a teacher and a mom of a 2-year old, there are always messes to be cleaned up. The convenience of having the wipes readily available is worth every penny!	&&&
I found multiple offers to stack that allowed me to get this box of wipes for less than $2. It was my first time trying Huggies One and Done. I was really pleased with the refreshing cucumber scent. The wipes have a good surface area, are durable, and thick. You definitely can get more done with one wipe versus other brand and type of wipes. I would definitely purchase again!	&&&
three kids .. great wipes dont need to use many ..	&&&
Love this product. Great with cleaning and disinfecting so easy my eight year old can use them.	&&&
I do not buy these for many reasons . I work for a plant that made these sented and unsented kirkland brand baby wipes and many other wipes. I saw people touching raw wipes with thier hands no gloves and out them back on the production lines like it was nothing. Everynight something in testing would fail. It is super easy to turn baby wipe or any other wipe formula into an acid , so it is possible this burn people notice got by testing being high on the ph. Or maybe they just changed the formula and it sucks now. Another reason I wont buy these is cus the factory I worked in was so dusty is was ridiculous . The wipes ride a conveyor belt that is open so this dust could get on them. They clean with bleach the clean the conveyer the wipes ride on with bleach or bleach like product but dont rinse them to well. These product require chemical resistant PPE so what if it did nit get cleaned all the way and contaminated the products.	&&&
Great on disinfecting kitchen counters and bathrooms	&&&
Good size. Provides a light vanilla smell. Wish the wipes were a little sturdier/thicker.	&&&
Excellent product for quick and effective cleaning of multiple surfaces	&&&
just love it esp with the new scents	&&&
Clorox as been a mainstay in our family for years. It does the job effectively for a reasonable price.	&&&
very good product very satisfied and will use again	&&&
Thank you! Item exactly as described.	&&&
Lots of wipes for a good price!	&&&
Worked wonders!	&&&
We are getting so excited about the baby's arrival...getting such great accessories as these washcloths just gets us more in the mood. These cloths are soft and the size is great!	&&&
Handy cleaning wipes in a pack of three. No more, no less.	&&&
"WONDERFUL
WILL BE ORDERING THIS AGAIN"	&&&
this cleans nothing, do not use them for your lenses	&&&
Just like the description	&&&
Pampers sensitive wipes are the softest baby wipes I have found. I've tried a ton of different brands and these are definitely the best. My kids never had any issues that I had to specifically buy sensitive but liked to buy these because the were so soft. They are the best for newborn babies!!!	&&&
Bought these over the Huggies for the scent. Was a bad idea, the feels smooth but leave a little sticky residue. The smell isn't as pleasant as baby powder or Johnson's baby oil (when put in our wipes warmer they stink up the whole room.	&&&
Work as advertised.	&&&
I've used these since my daughter has been born. No issues with rashes or irritation and these are great for more than wiping baby bums. They also do awesome on the spot stain removal and cleans the dirt from my daughter's shoes. I also used them to spot clean the car seat of there was an unexpected stain.	&&&
I use the wipes to disinfect and clean my daughter's toys and high chair after every meal. Toddlers leave big messes and Clorox disinfecting wipes get the job done.	&&&
Love these for quick clean ups. I keep them handy to clean up after handling poultry or other items that leave germs behind.	&&&
Love the scent. Very easy to use on a daily basis.	&&&
We love the wipes for our busy household. Makes clean up easy and quick. Confident it is clean.	&&&
These things have been a cleaning savior, I don't know what I would do without them! From puppies and kids, to marker and grease they seem to cut through everything and help me spend less time cleaning.	&&&
I clean with these all the time. I recommend these to everyone. Gets everything so clean.	&&&
So quick and easy!! I love not having to grab a spray and a cloth to wipe up small messes. The cloth and cleaner are all in one and I don't have to search for it!	&&&
I use them all the time to disinfect the tables at the school where I work. They are convenient and effective.	&&&
This was a good price at Staples for the Lysol Wipes. Lysol Wipes are the best Disinfesting wipes on the market ! Can't beat Staples Price for 3 in a pack."}},	&&&
I love this brand because it kills 99.9% bacteria and viruses. Keeps your house smelling clean scent.	&&&
These are the smaller cartons of wipes-just an FYI. In my head, they were larger-I must have been thinking I was ordering a bonus pack. Got them on sale so I'm not complaining. Smell lemony fresh-are truly all purpose whether you're wiping a bathroom or a kitchen down."}}];	&&&
Great product, they are so easy to use. I keep a can in every bathroom. I live with a 3 males...it would be gross if I didn't have my clorox wipes to clean up after them!	&&&
I love these wipes for quick clean up. I use them in the bathroom and the kitchen mostly!	&&&
I use these wipes on everything. I tend to use two at a time because they are thinner than what I would like but I do like the smell and they way they clean.	&&&
With having a very active toddler at home, these wipes are perfect for our household. They are easy to use and very convenient. They get everything clean without having to get out spray and rags.	&&&
love using the Clorox disinfecting wipes at my home rate it a five Star	&&&
Love the way it wipes up stains and spills, disinfects the kitchen counters, sinks, and the bathroom. AWESOME productt	&&&
It is very easy getting my kitchen clean with clorox wipes!!	&&&
Great at killing germs and keeping the house clean.	&&&
Very good wipes. Use them for adult incontinence care. Live up to the name "One and Done."	&&&
What a great product. Wipes are very soft and they don't shred apart.	&&&
They are very soft and have a nice scent. I have very sensitive skin and believe that I can't be too careful when it comes to my baby's skin. They are perfect.	&&&
I love clorox wipes! I use them in the kitchen and in the bathroom...I know everything I use them on is clean and disinfected!	&&&
"They smell good and they do the job."	&&&
I got these as a sample and waited for a day that I wore waterproof eyeliner and mascara. I've been using the Josie Maran ones for quite a while and been satisfied, but sometimes the heavy and dark eye makeup doesn't come off completely. These are amazing. One swipe and all the color was off my eyelids. After a second swipe, the mascara and my brow pencil was gone. Yes, they burned. But everything I've ever used on my eyes burns a little because they're sensitive. Also, I've always had to wash my face after I do a remover wipe or liquid. So I would recommend immediately washing your face and there should be no problem with prolonged stinging.	&&&
These are gereat for travel or going to a friends house. No issue with marking and they stay on nicely.	&&&
Clorox wipes are my go to cleaner. They are easy to use and compact enough to fit in every room of my home	&&&
I am a first time mom and didn't know there would be such a difference in the brands of wipes. I received several different brands at my show and I will only use Huggies now!	&&&
I just love clorox wipes and can not live without them ! I have 4 kids in which 2 are under the age of 4 !! Love yalls products !!!	&&&
I am in love with this product. The time it saves makes the little extra expensive worth it. It saves me time in preparing cleaning supplies for a job as well as the time it takes to wash the products I would normally use to clean with.	&&&
Excellent product! Kills germs to keep my child and myself from getting sick while cleaning the grease off my stove and the toilet bowl mess that can happen with a toddler.	&&&
I love cleaning the toilets with these. It's less ukky...	&&&
I only purchase these wipes along with the sensitive swaddler diapers for my little one!!	&&&
So convenient, love them. Always have them on my countertop!	&&&
Great wipes! Super soft and way better for our babies than the wipes with all the chemicals!! :)	&&&
Lysol wipes disinfects more then clorox	&&&
I chose not to buy a wipe warmer after reading many parent comments about how it was a unnecessary item. However, I have a winter baby, and he would cringe and fuss whenever the cold wipe would touch his little butt. So I decided to try out the wipe warmer, figuring that it was only $20, and if it didn't work, it was only $20. But the warmer has been great in keeping my little guy happy during diaper changing time. December was a cold month in our household, and having warm wipes made all the difference for my baby. The wipes stay warm enough, and it is easy to clean. I have had no problems with the warmer thus far (after one month of use) and am very satisfied. I have tried 3 different types of wipes: pampers sensitive, the target brand wipes and huggies (all were gifts, so I was able try the 3 brands out). The best wipes were definitely the pampers sensitive. The target brand wipes are too thin and would stop coming through the opening when I would pull them out and the huggies are too thick, and would also stop coming through the opening when I would pull them.	&&&
I love using clorox wipes. I have 3 kids and there very easy to use to clean up with. I use them a lot	&&&
yes this stuff is the bomb foor cleaning the bathroom i love this product	&&&
"We purchased these to clean our monitors in our office, after using one of the wipes it left the screen looking worse than before. There were streaks all over the screen.. I would NOT recommend these."	&&&
I purchased these for my som who is a college freshman, he said that they were really convenient and easy to use and made him fill a little more comfortable about sharing a bathroom with 3 others.	&&&
Use it on all surfaces. Super easy to clean up messes left by little kids.	&&&
I have been using this product for years and it never fails me.	&&&
These wipes always give my daughter diaper rash. I now buy pampers sensitive and this stopped happening. So it had to be the huggies wipes.	&&&
i love love love clorox but am on a tight budget and its hard for me to afford it	&&&
Clorox wipes makes cleaning spills easy, disinfecting especially this time of the year a breeze. I use them every where.	&&&
We've been buying these for years and use them at home, in the office and keep spares int he cars. They come in handy for some many uses, including personal care, children, grandchildren, accidental spills and just general cleaning. A pack this size generally lasts my husband and I about 2 months.	&&&
Our favorite face and hand wipes. Works great and no residue/film left over after you use them.	&&&
I love clorox wipes because they are quick and easy to use and clean great. One wipe and the mess is gone disinfected and smells great. perfect for my busy house.	&&&
These are great. I use these especially because they cut grease. I have black appliances and it makes me nuts to see streaks on them after I wipe them down. Before I found these I was using windex kitchen cleaner but didn't like the smell, spray and extra work of scrubbing (ex:stovetop after cooking or frying something). These wipes are wonderful and take the work and streaks out of everything and disinfects as well. Love it	&&&
"Lysol Disinfecting wipes work great in the office, I use them on our telephones, keyboards, copy machines, door knobs, light switches. Especially when someone comes to the office sick they are great to kill the germs."	&&&
Clorox Wipes are better to clean counters than soap and water	&&&
perfect wipes to get the job done because i have a so and disable husband they both waste things when they are together	&&&
Love it will buy it again used it all the time cleans very well smell great	&&&
Great product! Especially when you need to clean up something quickly!	&&&
"The most frustrating thing about stainless steel is the name to me……it should be stainfull steel. It seems that it is constant with a family of four and three dogs, that there is always marks on the fridge or the stove or the dishwasher. And cleaning it is always frustrating, cause the minute that you clean it it is dirty again. My wife found these cleaners and we love them. Two of them can clean the fridge, stove, dishwasher and microwave. Everything comes out clean with little scrubbing and leaves a clean look when complete. It is strange though it is not a shine, but the stainless steel has a sleek look to it once you clean them. And it lasts, not a day, not a week, at least ten day to two weeks. There is no need to wipe down the product over and over again. If you want a clean home this is the way to go.

PROS:
++Ability to clean
++Ease of use
++Cost
++Amount of wipes in the container

CONS:
--Dried out before we used all the wipes

CONCLUSION:
I have to give this 5 stars, even with the drying out of the wipes before we used them. The product works great and they don’t cost an arm and a leg. This makes it worth the 5 stars hands down. This is a great product that I highly recommend."	&&&
I opened a new package of wipes last night and the material used for the wipes is very different than what is typically in the container. It's much softer, trying to rip it from the next wipe in the container requires quite a bit of pulling and stretches the wipe out. They remind me of Clorox wipes which I do not care for. Please go back to the previous way of manufacturing them. I'm only giving this 3 stars simply because I hate the new material, otherwise it would be a 5.	&&&
I like knowing everything is nice and clean after cleaning with clorox	&&&
I loves these wipes they smell good and get the job fone	&&&
I mainly purchased these to remove my makeup and they worked really well, regardless of heavy application. I'm very satisfied.	&&&
I really like this product, its very convenient for on the go. I would've liked it to fit a bit of more wipes but it still does the job.	&&&
"seems like the top of the wipes in the dispensed area dries out though quicker than I thought it would but it was a decent price and everything else about it has been helpful"	&&&
I have tried several other cleaners for my stainless steel appliances. Nothing is as quick, easy or thorough as these wipes! Wipe on and buff with a clean dry towel and you are done! Perfectly clean!	&&&
Just as I hope it would be, I will be using this for some time to come I am very please with what I received, Thank You	&&&
Pampers wipes is a must have cause it makes the dirty job easy.	&&&
I was using Huggies wipes, but they are not gentle on the skin. I tried quite a few brands and this is perfect. Does not irritate and is not overly wet like some wipes.	&&&
The only time I buy the sensitive wipes is when my son has a bad rash. Both types clean great but the sensitive ones seem to make him less irritable when sore. I tried huggies wipes and I think Huggies should have to pay me! These wipes are the best.	&&&
Like these, love softness, nice smell, not as thick/sturdy as one & done wipes though, wish they could be. Otherwise, great wipes.	&&&
Sickening smell now. The lemon scent was great and all I bought. I bought 4 or 5 of the new fragrance and can't stand the smell. Went back to the red container and now can't find them! Go back to the Lemon scent quickly	&&&
We have always used Handi Wipes and love being able to buy in bulk. Handi Wipes are a great product which. We throw them into the washing machine with our kitchen towels and use them over and over again until they are worn out.	&&&
I love these wipes and I use them for everything! They are not just a booty wipe in our house, we use them to clean up my daughter's face after she eats messy foods and even keep a pack in my horse trailer to wipe or hands and arms down after riding. Cant tell you how much I love these wipes!	&&&
This the most pleasant smelling antibacterial wipes. We've used this around the office instead of the hand so the place doesn't smell like Colox wipes. Everything cleaned smells so much better. If you just use it to clean your keyboard, mouse, and monitor you can re-use this a couple of times too. Just stuff it in a sandwich ziploc. This is a great product for hand or equipment and can clean quite a bit.	&&&
These little wipes were fine but I won't purchase them again because they are hardly any wipes in the packet.	&&&
A great overall wipe, does not leave a sticky or smelly residue behind. Use them to wipe the dog's ears clean, fast and easy. I use an old wipe dispenser, since i do not find the top reseal flap very effective.	&&&
These wipes are great at cleaning even the darkest makeup off... They're small, convenient, and smell good, too.	&&&
I was curious about this product & since i was buying a product from the same brand I decided to try it out. I ended up returning the product ( & went back to the brand i used before). The product made me itch & the smell wasn't pleasant @ all.	&&&
"When I received this product in the mail, at first I was a little disappointed. This pack of wipes was bent and stuffed into the corner of then box along with my other purchases. At first I didn't think it was a big deal, So what the packaging was a little wrinkled. However on further inspection I noticed that there were tiny holes and puncture marks on the packaging along with the chemical smell that goes with the product. I didn't open it, and I returned it to my local Ulta I had no problem getting a replacement (might I add that the staff were so sweet and so understanding !).
I have made these wipes a part of my daily routine , using it every morning and night after I wash my face. I didn't notice automatic results, and to be completely honest I thought it was making me break out even more. But I stuck it out and now I am really starting to see a difference in my complexion. It's not perfect yet, I still have some problem spots. But there is a reduction in my breakouts and pimples."	&&&
Great deal	&&&
Best Wipes Ever	&&&
it is good	&&&
"We use this for cloth wipes, we keep them dry and spray with a solution before using.

The weighted piece holds down the wipes so that you only get one at a time, it's not attached to the container in anyway, so when it is full the weighted piece sometimes comes out. As long as we don't overfill it's fine and there's no issue.

Very pleased with the product overall. It is sturdy and does not tip or move when we use it."	&&&
Have always used this brand and loved them. Durable and thick.	&&&
got these as a sample to try out for free. and i love them i wish i would have found out about this brand earlier with having 4 kids i could have really started using these along time ago.	&&&
I never thought I'd be ok with an adult wet-wipe. But here I am 2 months in and I don't want to live without these. They leave you CLEAN and FRESH. I highly recommend using these to keep that fresh feeling all day long.	&&&
Great product to use for a quick baby refresher. Also great for a quick clean on the go! Wish they had larger sizes to choose from as we leave a bag by our changing table as well.	&&&
"I use it to wipe baby nose , it help and clean my baby"	&&&
The disinfecting wipes not only clean very well but I love the smell. I have tried other brands but this one beats any out there.	&&&
Love the thick and wonderful smelling wipes.	&&&
"I love these wipes! They are the only ones that my 6 week old lets me use to wipe his nose. He cries if I use anything else. I also used these on myself when I just had a cold, as they didn't make my nose all chapped and dry. They also smell great too! I wish the price was a little bit cheaper though. I also wish Babies R Us carried the tubs of them."	&&&
love clorox products to keep my house clean and free of germs!	&&&
Love wiping my daughters high chair with clorox wipes as well as my kitchen . great stuff although a bit over priced.	&&&
I use these on my kitchen counter tops every day. I am never without the Disinfecting Wipes!	&&&
I love the convenience of Clorox Wipes because the disinfect surfaces, while deodorizing your home at the same time.	&&&
Clorox Wipes are so convenient! They quickly and easily clean up messes while disinfecting at the same time.	&&&
I find these a bit abrasive. Our baby cries almost instantly when we use these wipes on him. He needs diaper rash cream as a result of these. Also, both of our hands are cracking and require constant moisturizer. This was our first bulk buy, as our baby is only one month old. Perhaps all wipes are this bad. Only time will tell.	&&&
These are great all over the house! They are a must have in a house full of boys.	&&&
I love huggies wipes! They're thicker than other wipes I've purchased, and cost less than the thinner brands.	&&&
I love these wipes for disinfecting varies areas around my home. However, they need to be followed with a paper towel to pick up any crumbles.	&&&
The wipes have been wonderful this winter; keeping the germs away. I am the only one in the office; who; has not gotten sick."}}];	&&&
I love the smell its refreshing and clean.i use these wipes more in the bathroom but sometimes in the rooms to wipe of dust on certain items.they work great sometimes i even spray some of the disinfecting spray to add alittle more moisture on them	&&&
awesome product I love clorox products has the entire house smelling fresh	&&&
I have been using clorox wipes for everything in the houe and love it.	&&&
we use clorox wipes for everything in our house like wiping counters or table tops, in the restrooms, cleaning stains and wiping down my 10mo old's toys! I absolutely love them!	&&&
I'm extremely pleased to find these available here on Amazon. I've used the product for a long time. They do the job well, they're durable and can be discarded after a good many uses have rendered them a bit ragged. Now the stores I have access to seem to have dropped them. In their place is a similar product by a different company that sells cleaners. I did buy one pack of those--and expect it to be my last pack. They're nowhere as good, beginning to fall apart right after the first use. So here I am back with my real Handi Wipes again thanks to Amazon.com.	&&&
These are good wipes, they didn't irritate my kids bottoms and they were very moist, however they are somewhat small so you tend to go through more. I would recommend these for parents whose children have sensitive skin.	&&&
This is terrific and keeps the wipes wet for weeks at a time, with slow usage. It easily attaches to the diaper bag and is easily refilled. A great buy.	&&&
great product, everything always feels truly clean after use.	&&&
Fast, easy, and amazing at removing kitchen/bathroom messes! No other brand works like Clorox for my family.	&&&
5 out of 5! You co wrong with an easy to use effective product!	&&&
"""I use these wipes every single day every time

I feed my son! I absolutely love them. They smell great they get the job done and honestly there is a difference between using these and using regular baby wipes.y son hates the smell and the taste the regular wipes leave, these just smell and taste great! Love love LOVE!! I always buy 4-5 packs at a time ;)"""	&&&
love theses wipes they are wonderful. they clean up messes and makes my baby fill fresh and smell fresh	&&&
While I prefer to use Greenworks to be green sometimes as a mom I need more. Like this morning when my son threw up. Instead of a spray that takes longer to dry I can use the wipes for fast and easy disinfecting and clean up.	&&&
"""I bought this because I thought it would look nice on my desk, rather than the large ""tube o' wipes"". However, it certainly is not worth the bit of decoration it gives.



First, the wrapping was put on so that the seam is right in the front. Since it's meant to be decorative, it would be nice if the seam was on the back of the package.



Next, my attempts to open it and get the first wipe started were met with annoyance and difficulty. The little flip top is not large enough to get my fingers through because the petal-edges are not flexible at all. And the white part in the picture, what you would think is a lid, is not removable at all. I ended up using tweezers, and tearing off little bits on numerous failed tries, as has been mentioned by previous reviewers.



After finally getting one started through the opening, I was unimpressed with the material and the amount of moisture. You know the cheap, brown paper towels in public restroom dispensers? These feel like a dampened, wrung out, thin version of those. I needed several just to clean off my computer screen.



It might do all the things the product details claim, but for the number that you need to use for each cleaning, it's certainly not worth the price, and definitely not something I will buy again."""	&&&
Clorox wipes are a staple in my home. I always like to wipe everything down to make sure everything has been cleaned. we use them at my office and also at my child's school. I like to purchase the 3 pack and send a few to the school, the teachers love to have them. Its great to have around with all of the colds and flu going around this winter.	&&&
I am on subscribe and save and bought these ones because they were cheaper. They are no good! They don't have the feel of regular wipes they are very dry and they have a bad smell. I really just want to through them away but I'm trying to get through it. Will not buy again.	&&&
The refill packages keep the wipes moist until you are ready to refill the wipe holder. They do drying out slightly faster than Pampers baby wipes, but I've never really had a real issue	&&&
These are the best baby wipes. We have tried a whole bunch and kept going back to these. I like these wipes better then the free & clear seventh generstion ones I see at the store that have the white plastic top. These are less soapy. Buying them on Amazon is the cheapest way to get them and we have them on autoship. Very convenient we never forget to buy them!	&&&
I am a baker and my counter tops need to stay clean and fresh. Clorox does just that. It keeps my counter tops germ free while keeping the air scented with hints of lemon. I suggest you run out and try this product today.	&&&
I have never purchased them personally, but I have used them at my workplace. They are amazing, works well, and leaves a great clean space afterwards.	&&&
I love it ! I use it all the time and wouldn't use anything else!	&&&
"This was a good price at Staples for the Lysol Wipes. Lysol Wipes are the best Disinfesting wipes on the market ! Can't beat Staples Price for 3 in a pack."	&&&
These wipes are the most convenient, dependable, easy to use wipes out there. After using them, you can smell the clean in the area where they were used.	&&&
These are the only wipes we use, love them!	&&&
Your product is wonderful, it cleans great and isn't expensive	&&&
I love using Clorox!!! I use it everyday a lot. It's convenient using the Clorox wipes. It really disinfects and smells so fresh and clean.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are Awesome!!! These wipes are a must have around my house and on the job. They are so easy to use that my daughter can grab one out and help me clean. At work when I get paint on my hand and can't run to the sink , I just wipe my hand with one and it removes every spec. Thanks Clorox for an awesome product.	&&&
Great wipes. Good for sensitive skin and never had any issues using it on my baby. Seventh generation is my go-to brand for more eco-friendly, less harsher chemical products.	&&&
9/10 excellent product especially if you have kids	&&&
Great for all those baby messes. Works wonders on food thrown into the floor.	&&&
If you need your house clean Clorox is the best choice. Disinfects and smells great. I love Clorox.	&&&
So handy to have these in the house during winter. I wipe everything down with them. there are a ton of wipes in the container.	&&&
I love these wipes, and they are awesome on grease!	&&&
It's so easy to just grab a sheet that pops up and wipe the countertop after prepping food, or wipe and sanitize the plastic cutting board after use.	&&&
Great Product, great value for the price, makes clean up a snap!	&&&
Best wipes out there! Least amount of chemicals that you can get in disposable wipes. We use cloth wipes at home with water and baby shampoo, and use these on the go. NO smell at all! I hated Pamper's Sensitive for the smell!	&&&
Clorox wipes are great, the kids and I love to use them.	&&&
Quick easy cleanup and disinfects as well great for little messes or quick cleanups	&&&
I love using Clorox Toilet bowl cleaner and disinfecting wipes. When I am done cleaning my bathroom it smells great AND I know it is clean! Thanks Clorox!	&&&
These are just the greatest wipes ever. My daughter used those thick baby wipes that weren\u2019t flushable, until while shopping at Costco we discovered these Kirkland Moist Flushable Wipes. These can be flushed down the toilet and that is amazing. In all the places I have lived they have never clogged the toilet either. Even in a home that had a septic tank. As my grandkids got older, they continued to use the wipes to clean themselves off and keep from getting rashes. I had them in my house for their use and started using them myself as a way of cleaning up, after using toilet paper. I wouldn\u2019t be without them in my home now. Everyone in my family of all ages now uses them. They don\u2019t dry out, have a easy lift attached lid that is attached to a much smaller plastic bag type container (instead of those huge bulky plastic containers that baby wipes come in). We even carry them in the car for any messy clean ups of hands and such. This product is now a staple in our homes. I highly recommend it. Wiping with a gentle, nice smelling, biodegradable wipe like this is a must for cleanliness.	&&&
The product smells great and leaves my surfaces in my kitchen and bathroom looking great. I love this product!!	&&&
"I adore this item, and regret not having one for my first child. Unless you spent a few weeks carrying diapers, wipes, a nose sucker, tummy gas medicine, saline for little noses, and diaper rash cream or vaseline from room to room, you really can't appreciate it.
It's been a life saver.
Yes, I agree with other reviews and it does seem cheaply made, cardboard and glue. And the drawer is impossible to open unless you are bracing it with one hand while yanking it open with the other.
BUT, the convenience of having everything In one spot is worth it.
Fitting the wipe container exactly without it coming out when I pull a wipe out is almost worth it right there.

Overall, the price was worth the convenience."	&&&
I don't use any other disinfecting wipes. These are super convenient and keep the germs away.	&&&
lemon scent smells clean, works well, and the wipes are so easy and convenient.	&&&
I prefer these to anyother wipes, gets the job done and are safe to use around pets and kids.	&&&
Freshens and disinfects. Smells clean. Easy to use very convenient.	&&&
Whomever invented Clorox wipes is a genius! I love being able to take my Clorox wipes with me in the car, to work, and wherever I go!	&&&
I can not imagine life without these with the kids...	&&&
Caution--these don't come in the resealable package, which means they can't be used on the go. They can only be used for a plastic wipes container at home. Love the wipes, but accidentally bought wrong packaging.	&&&
I use them in every room of the house, and the car. Great for quick clean-ups.	&&&
La la LOVE these wipes.	&&&
Very handy with three kids and you're always on the go!	&&&
Bert good product, mete expectation	&&&
I'm expecting soon and I would want to know that Im bringing in my new born child into a clean and safe environment. I don't have to worry about bacteria because Clorox disinfecting wipes does its job.	&&&
I like how easy they are to grab and use. Especially with twins in the house.	&&&
I use these wipes after cleanup of just about everything. They are life savers!!	&&&
The best product to keep disinfect the kitchen and bathroom	&&&
it works really good. i would definitely recommend to my family and friends.	&&&
i love those wipes, makes my cleaning easy and specially my daughters toys its really disenfets	&&&
These wipes are great in the bathroom, kitchen and in the yard!	&&&
Clorox wipes are a quick reliable way to keep my home and car clean, germ free and fresh. I use them to wipe down inside my car daily. I use them to wipe down door knobs and light switches at home. Keeps germs away, and keeps my little ones messes to a minimum.	&&&
Great products love the Clorox wipes use those to clean and disinfect	&&&
Super Thin and you have to use a lot not worth the money . Costco or Huggies are the way to go !	&&&
Bought it for my home with all wood floors. I love it, does a great job and even more important, my wife loves it. We just use water with a little vinegar and it cleans quite well, so it is not only effective, it is economical to use. We use it on wood and tile floors and even to suck up major spills on the floor.	&&&
Clorox wipes are easy to use and a great way to spend your money. They disinfect and you can use them for easy spills. They are a nice product to use if you need to clean something quickly, and also thou roughly. I highly recommend this product.	&&&
I really love Clorox disinfecting wipes! They are easy to use and get the job done. I use them all over my house, out at the store for the carts, restaurants for the high chair and table for the baby.	&&&
they were very convenient and easy to use. Worked very well!	&&&
"Ever had a glass or two of wine, only to be horrified at the stains on your teeth when you look into a mirror? It feels like you put some of that black out gum on your teeth!

These little wipes are a huge help for that. Not perfect - they don't taste great and can dry out if not stored well. But they are a must for the wine aficionado."	&&&
Love Clorox wipes. It is a big help especially having 2 messy dogs in a house where accidents easily happen. Makes clean up easy!	&&&
Our frenchie has sensitive skin and we've used these wipes since he was two months. The are gentle and smell great. Highly recommend to anyone with a sensitive dog.	&&&
I like to use Clorox Wipes in my office space to disinfect work area.	&&&
I love this Washcloths! I use for my newborn during diaper change, just deep it in the water and clean her. It is very soft on baby skin! Way better than the wet wipes, which I feel really irritate the skin if used on daily basis.	&&&
i love clorox because it disinfects and cleans better than any other product	&&&
These wipes are great for at the end of the day when you need to take off your make-up and/or clean off the dirt and oil build up from the day. They are also great when traveling for short trips and don't have the time or room to bring all of your normal beauty/cleansing products with you. Just make sure you like the scent of grapefruit, because it really does smell just like the fruit.	&&&
I couldn't live without these disinfecting wipes	&&&
i used pampers sensitive wipes for all of my kids. They are perfect for newborns. I really believe they are the reason my kids did not get diaper rash. They are so soft and great for sensitive skin. If you use other wipes and have to use 7 in one changing that can create redness and make it worse.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes. They are so convenient, and easy to use.	&&&
These are the best wipes available. We've never had any issues with sensitivity while using these wipes. Strong, thick, and sturdy. These get the job done.	&&&
"Clorox is always with us and now that my son went to college Clorox went him too. You never know when you gonna need it so we all in my family keep one in the cars garage kitchen laundry specially in the bathroom with my little ones around. Don't be afraid to bring it with you at all times germs are all over us but Clorox does what it need to be done no other is better than Clorox we used wipes sprays cleaners for the house . I highly recommended Clorox you can't go around without this product my favorite Clorox wipes!"	&&&
I have 5 kids and I only buy clorox wipes they clean so well. we have been using them for many years.	&&&
i use it for everything. love it. cleans everything	&&&
Super easy to use for moms on the go. I use them in the kitchen, bathroom and on the go.	&&&
I have used these wipes since 2011, and I have always loved them until recently. They smell terrible, like they have previously been used to clean a poopy bottom. They are making my husband and me gag when we use them. I cannot stress enough how terrible the smell is. Can someone from Costco please comment and let us know if Kirkland will go back to their original formula for these wipes? I cannot purchase these again until someone confirms return to the old formula. Thank you.	&&&
Love Clorox because its always dependable cleaning and disinfecting	&&&
There is never a time that we do not have a container of Clorox wipes under our counter.	&&&
Product wipes are small dry and streak badly	&&&
These wipes are the worst I've ever purchased. They feel like wet cheap paper towels.	&&&
I bought this during Amazon's birthday sale, which was more of a garage sale consisting of old coins, jewelry, and old Skylanders, among other things. The fact that Amazon pays for huge boxes to ship these for almost no cost is amazing. I used a couple of these on my desk and it looks much cleaner. Thanks again Amazon!	&&&
Been using them for a long period of time, almost since they hit the market I believe!!!	&&&
Why would you change a good product? The new packaging does not work. No longer does the next wipe pop up. Hate to say, but Total Home works better.No reason to pay the higher price.	&&&
The wipes for huggies are good but the pampers aren't good..	&&&
Need to buy more!	&&&
Container is a good size but I don't like the smell!	&&&
So easy to apply, with no real scent. This are going to be a must have for my family on all future camping trips.	&&&
Love the wipes, but sadly we're one of those customers who switched to another brand because they don't pull out quickly in a poopy emergency.	&&&
I love the smell and freshness of these wipes! i would recommend them. i always feel like my baby is left clean after using these wipes.	&&&
I'll start with my complaint - these stick together like crazy. It can be frustrating but I just stuff the extras back in, no problem. Otherwise, these wipes work very well and contain the mess. There's no irritating smell or residue. I feel a little better about using them with all the 'green' pro's versus the big con of disposable wipes. I figure this is the best option next to reusable wipes.	&&&
I love these wipes. They don't have a scent. They don't leave your hands sticky. They clean your baby nicely without leaving residue. Best of all the price is great! These are my go to wipes for my little guy (5 months).	&&&
I got this as a tissue box because my dog gets into the regular tissue boxes and eat them. The weighted opening works perfect dispensing indivudual Kleenex tissues. (Otherwise I would use a empty wipes box) It fits a entire box of 230 count Kleenex. With the tissues covered in this box it's out of mind out of sight for the dog and convient to use.	&&&
I love how thick these wipes are makes cleaning up easier!! Also I love that they have fragrance free wipes since my sons skins very sensitive	&&&
Clorox wipes are a convenient way to disinfect anything.	&&&
I like them because i have always trusted this brand. This is the same brand that my mother used	&&&
Awesome product. Works well with my wipes! Only drawback is that it won't hold 100 wipes, so I have to find something else to hold the 25 wipes until I use enough to refill. Otherwise it is one of the best purchases I've made!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They are so convenient to use!	&&&
Always gets the job done...easy to use & fast clean up...	&&&
I really like this product they are easy to use and help me keep my home clean with two small children.	&&&
we use these for everything! can't remember life without them.	&&&
I use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes every day in my kitchen. They are a very convenient way to keep cooking surfaces sanitary and safe for my family.	&&&
After cleaning my new stove with Lysol wipes, I was afraid it would never look new again. It had streaks and the finish looked more dull. After using this product, my stove looks new again every time! Just follow directions to wipe with the wipes, then buff with a soft microfiber towel.	&&&
These wipes work great and are easy to use. My go-to wipe for disinfecting, especially in the kitchen and bathrooms.	&&&
I always use the Clorox disinfecting wipes for my bathrooms. Just wipe and toss. So easy! Really deodorizes too. Love them	&&&
I love the all purpose lemon scent it smells so clean and it works great for disenfect stuff	&&&
High quality cloth wipes. Nice scent. We keep them everywhere, car, backpacks, coat pockets.	&&&
Easy to use and I use those to clean the hole house.. leaves it smelling fresh and clean	&&&
I love them! I have a container in every bathroom for day to day cleaning! I highly recommend them !	&&&
they work great to clean and disinfect would never use something else	&&&
I have pets so minimizing the smells are important to me!! So here's a product I've trusted for 8 years!!	&&&
This is the the softest and most gentle wipe out there. I have tried several wipes and this is by far my favorite. Very cost effective also which is a great bonus.	&&&
Love the Clorox disinfecting wipes. They are all I'll use in my kitchen and bathrooms!	&&&
These work great. I use the though out the house, bathroom, kitchen, wiping off toys, you name it gets used.	&&&
I buy Pampers for diapers, but I prefer Huggies for their wipes. The quality and texture is so much thicker. There is less mess and it cleans better because it's more durable. I also like this particular scent; it's light and refreshing.	&&&
I just love the Clorox disinfecting wipes. I use them everyday at work to clean my phone, keyboard, desk as well as the kitchenette area. I love the fragrances, the ease of use and the fast drying feature. I would love it if Clorox made small packages for my purse so I could use at restaurants, the grocery store and out doing mall shopping. I love clean and hate germs!"}},	&&&
I got these because my daughter doesnt like any wipes i have tried. She loves them and so do i. These are great, i use them with warm water, and dont use as many. They hold up great compared to the ones i got from the hpspital and they are soft.	&&&
Amazing product! Must have when you have children!	&&&
Wipes makes my life so easy. As a busy woman on the job, I need cleaning to be quick and effective. Thank you!	&&&
a must in my bathroom I have three boys this makes for easy cleaning and disinfects too!	&&&
clorox is all I clean with in my house my truck and I even take the wipes on my school bus there amazing	&&&
great product I use these all the time. I would definitely recommend this product.	&&&
I love everything Clorox!! These wipes are convenient, powerful and just easy to use. I will always use clorox products. i find them to be the best overall.	&&&
Is so easy and fast! disinfects and clean in seconds!!!	&&&
Love these wipes,so easy and convenient for kids to use.	&&&
Love the wipes. Don't care for the smell. Unscented would be much better	&&&
Great product and the green canister has the best smell!	&&&
"I love using this product. Every morning when I come into my office I wipe down my desk and phone. When I go into the ladies room I always take a wipe with me for the toilet. I know with using this product I am cutting down on the germs and bacteria. I have Lupus and my immune system is low. Using Clorox wipes helps, not to mention the Lavender scent smells good. The price is also worth it shopping through Staples."	&&&
Before I had my baby I thought I would only use the competitor. I had started out using them and shortly after and since then on I only use Huggies everything. I find great prices, great options, and coupons and the wipes are durable, safe and good for my baby.	&&&
The most positive thing about these is that they didn't turn my skin red which is normally an issue I have with facial wipes. Other than that they are just average. They are moist enough & smell fine, but I think they are overpriced for what you get, since the wipes aren't textured or very heavy duty. I'd give them a try if you have sensitive skin.	&&&
I use these when a spill happens. instead of grabbing the spray and rag, just rip out a towelette and wipe.	&&&
Oh yes I love these wipes. These are honest to god my favorite wipes. I love that they are from a renewable source. They are 100% biodegradable and gentle on my babies. No harsh chemicals. And what an amazingly convenient box of 900! Sounds like a massive deal to me. I highly recommend these.	&&&
Clorox is my go to brand, even without coupons the prices on the disinfecting wipes is still very reasonable. I Love however when I am able to snag myself a coupon to sweeten my purchase!!	&&&
I have used Kirkland wipes for almost 16 years for everything. This new batch smells so nasty I accused one of my kids (14 years old) of having an "accident" when he used them to wipe his sticky hands because he smelled, well, poopy. Don't buy these; they smell truly terrible, like they have been used already.	&&&
great product i use this product every day and recommend it to all my friend with small children and dogs. Great on surfaces like toilets tubs counter car seats	&&&
I love these wipes, My son has very sensitive skin and huggies wipes work beautiful with him.	&&&
with a little one running around the house. easy and fast drying to use so i find this safe for my son when cleaning surfaces.	&&&
I had yet to find a product I trust to clean and disinfect in my home until I found Clorox wipes.	&&&
like this product. It's convenient and can put it in the car and not worry about it spilling	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! I use these everyday around the house to clean and disinfect. I also send these to school for their everyday use too.	&&&
I have used various clorox products and have loved every one.	&&&
Best wipes in travel packs!	&&&
use frequently on the kitchen island. great to disinfect with	&&&
They are easy to use and they work. They are affordable and I use them everywhere. Off brands do not compare.	&&&
as a teacher it is so easy to grab a wipe and clean classroom to help fight germs and keep my students safe.	&&&
Clorox wipes make cleaning effectively so quick and easy!!!	&&&
"These wipes are the only thing my daughter will tolerate when she has a runny nose. They are SO soft and don't irritate like regular tissues do. We love them!"	&&&
They make my house nice and clean, fresh and deodarise. Great to just grab and go. thicker than store brand. no residue like paper towel.	&&&
What's not to love about a clean & germ free house.	&&&
This is a great product. Very easy to use and convenient. Just grab a wipe and clean.	&&&
I just love this product! Ive been using this for the longest	&&&
Love how gentle these are on my baby's skin an also how good they smell	&&&
While these are not all natural as I think they should be, they are WAY BETTER than the Babyganics and conventional wipes. Clean up the formula, make them all natural, and give us more value, then I will give 5 stars.	&&&
Clorex brand is the only brand of cleaning product I use in my house. I love the disinfecting power it has!!	&&&
these wipes are better than any other name brand or store brand. They are NOT slimy like some others. thick, soft and wipes clean. Not to mention a great price!	&&&
I love Clorox Cleaning Wipes for cleaning all sorts of messes in my home! They smell great, are heavy-duty picker uppers and disinfect!	&&&
Easy to wipe and clean the kitchen counter tops with.	&&&
i can not go through my day without these. They are fantastic to have around the house with little ones.	&&&
I have used several at home tanning products in the past in an attempt to find a color similar to the tan I get in a tanning bed or even from a spray tan. I have always ended up orange and upset. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I read many reviews of this product and I believe that many people are experiencing issues because they are not preparing their skin before using the wipes. 2 days before using the wipes I exfoliated with a salt scrub (NOT a sugar scrub). I also avoided any soaps that contained perfumes or alcohol. The day before using the wipes I used a pure soap, one that contains no perfumes or alcohol and shaved (24 hours before). The day that I used the wipes I also used the soap a few hours before the wipes. I applied the tanning wipes. I used 1 wipe for my legs and another for the remainder of my body. I didn't use the wipe on my face. My face has some color because it always gets sun so I only put a little bronzer on it..it just looks more natural to me that way, just my preference. After I covered my entire body with the wipe I washed my hands and applied a bronzing lotion. The lotion helped to smooth the tan and avoid any streaks and also moisturized my skin. I let it all dry for about 10 minutes. I waited about 5 hours and applied the tan and moisturizer again. After the 2nd application I had a nice bronze tan that was natural looking and not at all orange. I was at least 3 shades darker than when I started. I waited until 24 hours after applying it to take a shower so that it has time to be absorbed well. I also apply bronzing lotion every morning and night. My tan looks great and has lasted several days. My daughter had a spray tan last week for her pageant and my tan looks just as good as her tan does. My only suggestion is to be sure that you take the time to prep your skin before you apply it...that is very important and will make a huge difference in how your tan turns out.	&&&
Easy and convenient! Love that they are tough on kitchen mess and they leave a nice clean scent.	&&&
I love the convenience of clorox wipes and they smell great to. I love to put them on my swiffer mop and clean the bathroom	&&&
The Lemon Clorox disinfecting wipes are great. They are convenient and easy to use. I keep some in my classroom to wipe off my tables and chairs.	&&&
Clorox is the only product that comes with the satiafaction of clean. I love it	&&&
These are perfect carry along wipes for any clean up need. I have used them for over 10 years. The reason I bought from Amazon is that my Giant food store stopped stocking this product.	&&&
They work just as good as clorox wipes but they are better for the environment!	&&&
These are my go to wipes. They aren't too wet or dry and hold up very well. Been using them since my son was born with no problems.	&&&
GREAT baby wipes. Just wish I could buy them in larger quantities at a greater discount.	&&&
i use these daily and love them I USE THEM IN MY KITCHEN ,LIVING ROOM, AND BATHROOM .	&&&
I use Clorox disintecting wipes for quick clean-ups at home.	&&&
Used these with both my daughter. I like the quality. They are absorbant! I have any other brand besides huggies."	&&&
These are perfect! The little ones can't open them and they look nice. With 3 little ones we have wipes everywhere.	&&&
I use these wipes when I travel. They clean very well and the packing is very light! I Would recommend!	&&&
I have been buying this brand of wipes since the day my daughter was born and till this day, she is now one, it has done the best job! always left her bottom feeling fresh and smooth.	&&&
I use these wipes to clean my pump parts at work when I can't really give them a good wash. You just take your pieces apart and give them a good wipe and let them air dry. The wipes are not too wet or too dry and they are good sized so you definitely get your money's worth.	&&&
This product worked really well. It helped keep my daughter's nose from getting irritated from her runny nose while she was sick. IT also smells good too. The only thing I don't like about it is the price. The packs are kind of small. Your better off getting the big pack.	&&&
Huggies wipes are the ones I use on my kids. They are 3 and 5 now so we keep them in the car and around the house for quick hand and face clean ups. Other wipes cant be used as they have a "yucky" taste according to my kids.	&&&
We keep a package of these at the dining room table for our little messy eater.	&&&
These are quality wipes for CPAP masks with a nice light scent. The 3 pack is a good deal compared to other wipes.	&&&
"My husband found baby wipes indispensable when he was posted to Afghanistan. In fact, other guys offered exorbitant amounts to buy some from him! Every care package I sent had plenty of wipes! He has very sensitive skin and loves the Aleva lavender wipes in place of toilet paper and for wiping hands and face. Scent is subtle but nice and they hold up well. We have found flushing a few at a time doesn't cause any problems with the plumbing. A terrific wipe for babies of all ages! They aren't cheap, though, and it's hard to keep the teenage grandkids out of them! As previously mentioned, the only problem is sometimes it's difficult to get just one or two out and once a wad comes out at once the whole package becomes a problem. A minor negative compared to all the positives."	&&&
I use this product regularly because is makes washing my face so simple. I hate water dripping down my arms when I wash my face so these are fantastic. My skin is sensitive and these work wonderfully with my skin. My face feels so good after using these.	&&&
These are nice and soft. Will have forever. They have lots of wetness to them and heavy cloth. Perfect for baby.	&&&
I love Pampers and all their products, including the wipes. However huggies are a little thicker, when it comes to cleaning bigger diaper messes you need two Pampers Baby Fresh Wipes so it does not soak through to your hands. But I still recommend them and buy a box every month.	&&&
Huggies wipes are thick and dont pick up anything. These Pampers wipes work WAY better!	&&&
FAST AND EFFICIENT.....HANDY, EFFORTLESS CLEANING. WORKS GREAT ON MY TINTED PLASTIC LENSES. SO FAR NO ADVERSE EFFECTS TO THE LENS NOTICED	&&&
My first time using these. I was using a different Burt's Bees Facial Wipe before I found these. I love that they have no scent so I can scrub on my face and not sneeze. They remove makeup like a dream. I use them to freshen up all over and to clean my feet after a long hot day in sandals. I may buy a larger amount to save money next time because I could see these going even more quickly than they are now. I'm kinda hoarding them now because they seem like a luxury item; I mean, I really oughta be using soap and water to clean my face, right? LOL	&&&
I love that their thick wipes but they rip so easily. Not good when trying towipee your babies poop and it rips when pulling wipe out."	&&&
It was very affordable, long lasting and good. I recommend this product.	&&&
the are good wipes but not enough liquid in them to where they are kinda dry sometimes and need to be wetted by hand due to dryness as if they are a cheaper brand. clorox wipes have a lot of fluid in the bottom if its needed"	&&&
The ionly thing good about this product is the scent... they dry out so quickly I wind up throwing most of them away	&&&
I tried these but found they tear easily but do the job	&&&
I love how they are perfectly moistened. It doesn't leaves any leftover residue and it cleans my lenses very well. The only thing that was a bit off is that I thought it was going to be one big box of 200 wipes. However, I received 3 boxes of 60 wipes for a total of 180 wipes and 20 in a travel bag. Perhaps they were out of the 200 count boxes. Not complaining though, since I got a small travel bag.	&&&
we buy a case of these each month...they are so convenient for touch-up cleanings around the house, messes you have to disinfect quickly, etc. Plus, since they stopped carrying the 4 oz cleanwell travel spray I used to love that was reasonably priced, I put a bunch of these wipes in a ziploc bag and in my purse to take with me on the go instead of hand sanitizer. Best disinfecting wipes we've tried on the market. I like the scent...it's very subtle to me and doesn't linger. The wipes are the perfect moisture and as long as you don't leave the lid open, I've never had issues with the wipes in the bottom being dry.	&&&
very good at cleaning and disinfecting tabletops, toys and other objects	&&&
"A Lifesaver!!!
This product is easy to use/
Is the go to product in the house with small children"	&&&
"Having a child in school, you know they bring home every germ out there. To protect my family, I use clorox disinfecting wipes daily. I know they will kill the germs and clean at the same time. It's like getting 2 for 1. Best value for me. One happy mother
South Georgia"	&&&
loved it. will buy again.. kids will clean with them too. Teenagers.	&&&
It's convenient for quick wipe-ups of kitchen countertops and bathroom surfaces--just wish the sheets were larger.	&&&
love the product and have been using it for many many years!	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are easy, powerful, and best of all... so convenient! They are definitely a must in any busy, modern day person's cleaning arsenal!	&&&
I love these wipes and I keep them in each bathroom and my kitchen. they smell good and I know it's disinfecting as it cleans.	&&&
Clorox wipes are awesome and smell great and freshen up my kitchen and bathrooms. I love them because they are so easy and convenient to use.	&&&
Clorox wipes are inexpensive and cleans very well especially small spills.	&&&
As a new mom with first baby, believe me I have tried every brand! Over all huggies natural care are the best wipes out there. These wipes are thick, strong & leaves baby's bottom soft. I absolutely love them!	&&&
"My baby isn't born yet and I keep these around anyway. They don't dry out even after a couple months. They're great to have on hand as flushable wipes for adults. I take them with me whenever I travel and use them for everything. They don't have a very strong fragrance, which I like, and they don't leave any residue which is my favorite part. I'll be using these in a couple of months on my baby."	&&&
Love These wipes they don't really have a smell at all. They are durable and work well. I prefer them over Pampers sensitive wipes	&&&
Great for quick clean ups. We keep them in our visitor bath so guests can use them to their satisfaction.	&&&
These wipes are great for cleaning small areas of your window or mirror. For larger areas, a liquid spray may be better since you may end up having to use many of these wipes. I use these wipes mostly for just cleaning my restroom mirror once a week and they work great and are convenient to use.	&&&
LOVE THE TOILET BOWL CLEANER! ALWAYS MAKES MY BATHROOM SMELL FRESH. ALSO LOVE CLOROX WIPES.	&&&
I honestly have no complaints about any Clorox products I have ever used. I use the wipes frequently in my house and in my car. I have no children of my own but when my niece and nephew are over it is nice to have them for when they get dirty. I also use many other products! I would recommend their products to anyone!	&&&
I have used many cleansing towels and even the most sensitive have caused some irritation (simple, cetaphil, yes to) however these wipes do not bother my very sensitive skin! I use them before and after the gym to gently cleanse my face!	&&&
Only wipes I use. As an adult, I like to keep my backside clean, 1-2 wipes per sitting. TP works but personally I feel cleaner using moist wipes. I must have sensitive skin, every other brand of wipe I've used causes me irritation. Wish the price wouldn't be so high but for the fresher feeling after a dump is worth it to me. These are cheaper than buying other wipes and Desitin.	&&&
Always great for a quick and easy cleanup that sparkles.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes , they make cleaning up faster and easier.	&&&
I love the scent. Wipes are moist,and easy and convenient to use. Each bottle contains a good amount of wipes. Would definitely buy more once my supply depletes.	&&&
Love these things! Use them in the kitchen, bathroom, car, everywhere!	&&&
This product does not remove coffee or tea stains off the counter tops. Nor does it remove food off of the walls.	&&&
"Purchased wipes for cleaning computer and television screens. Am satisfied with the results, so far. Have only used once, but will use more as needed. Definitely no smearing."	&&&
I used these self-tanning wipes on my arms for 5 days. I can't believe how much tanner my arms looked. Easy to apply. Doesn't look "orange". Looks very natural. Great for a tan without the dangers and high costs of a tanning salon.	&&&
Wonderful product. I was having a reaction on my hands from the chemicals in the wipes. These are fabulous. I have zero problems with them and we won't use anything else!!!	&&&
Our favorite kind of wipes.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes for not only cleaning up my bathroom but also for my pets who sometimes make a terrible mess. I like the wipes because its easy to use and they come in a bundle of 3 canisters. My dogs make a mess and Clorox wipes to the rescue so easy and quick! Love them.....	&&&
"The box comes with 20 wipes for your tanning pleasure. Each wipe comes individually packaged. Before each application it is advised to clean and exfoliate the skin. These wipes are considered ""half body"" wipes. After the application you need to let it soak in for 10 minutes before getting dressed. If you want a quicker tan, you can reapply after 4 hours.

The first time using these I actually tried to use gloves to apply the wipe (I was trying to avoid any excess on my hands). Turns out it was pretty difficult to apply with gloves, and didn't leave too much extra on my hands to wash off anyways. So after about halfway through I actually took them off and used just my bare hands. Much easier to apply. On day one I used the wipe in the morning, and then again later in the afternoon. The next day I used them again in the morning and later in the afternoon. I actually used one wipe each time and just hit my legs, arms, face and neck. I figured since its winter time, nobody will be seeing my stomach, thighs, or boobs anyways.

It wasn't until a few days later that there was another ""naptime"" for me to be able to apply again. And wouldn't you know, it was a few days after that, that another naptime came around for another application. The good news about that was, even every few days applying, I could tell it lasted in between applications. I really only wanted to get a nice glow, I wasnt looking to get super tan, and Glow 2 Go did the trick!

The only con about using a product like this is that you cant reach your back. But I guess if you are using these in the winter and aren't showing your back off in a bikini or halter top it really doesnt matter.

I also had a hard time getting everything perfectly even. I am thinking this is due to my lack of self tanner ""experience"". I accidentally kept brushing a portion of the wipe over a spot I had already done. So some parts of my legs were a little uneven. Good thing it's winter!

Now that I have talked about the cons I have found, lets talk about the pro's! Being a mom and care taker, and a one car family, it is hard for me to find time to go to an actual tanner. I cant tell you how convenient it was to be able to duck in the bathroom during nap time and quick do an application versus having to skip dinner while I run to the tanner. Not to mention its been anywhere from -1 to 13 degrees for the last week or so, REALLY making me not want leave the house for anything!! Its quick. It takes way less time to strip down, apply it, wait for it to sink in, and get dressed, than go somewhere. You could also kill two birds by doing your hair while you are waiting for it to sink in too.

Overall, if you want more of an ""at-home"" experience, or have an event coming up and just want a quick tan, then Glow 2 Go is something worth considering!"	&&&
These are the best wipes I've ever used, and being as lazy as I am I've tried everything from high end to store brands. My skin isn't tight or itchy after using them, just clean and fresh. They take off the waterproof mascara no problem and without rubbing. I love them.	&&&
These wipes are OK. I have yet to find remover wipes that are exceptional. They don't seem to dry out my skin or leave too much of a residue. Nothing really bad to say about these... Nothing amazing about them.	&&&
One of the Greatest products I have in my home. They are great to use with the Charmin paper. The kids use them all the time. Must nicer then mom having to help clean them. they can do it all themselves with these Wonderful Wipes.	&&&
Love Clorox products. They are the only brand I use.	&&&
I grew up on Clorox and I still purchase this product cause it keeps germs away especially since I have children.	&&&
I love all Clorox products they all work wonderful .. I would recommend to any body	&&&
Easy to use with two toddlers running around and gets the job done!	&&&
I love Clorox products, especially their disinfecting wipes.	&&&
I love that this product is chemical and fragrance free!!! But I wish the wipes were softer. They are stiff and rough to the touch. Using them on my baby's delicate skin up to 10 diaper changes per day, seemed like torture. Hubby tried them on himself and he agreed. Also, the wipes are not stacked accordian style, so most of the time I'll dig out 3 wipes at once. If these things are improved, then the product would be near perfect.	&&&
i ALWAYS have these in the house so it's easy for everyone to clean up after themselves!	&&&
I love the scent of these and the convenience of a wipe.Good powerful easy clean up.Especially on my countertops for spills!	&&&
We received several different brands of wipes as baby gifts. I love the Pamper Sensitive wipes because they are thicker, softer AND not as cold as the other brands. I have found my baby does not react when I wipe his bottom quite like he did with the other brand that was cold and wet!	&&&
With 4 kids, our house can become messy place real quick. I like to have a product that is readily available and has the cleaning power to make any mess tremble in my path.	&&&
"Fantastic for those stuck on crusty boogies that dont want to let go. My cousin turned me onto these wonderful little wipes and it makes the job of nose control so much easier. Would recommend to anyone who deals with crusty/stuck on mucus (also found they are good for eye boogies too)"	&&&
Aside from the great price, these are the largest pet wipes I have ever purchased.	&&&
I love this! It makes my house smell so clean, I wouldnt use any thing else to keep my house feel so refreshed and sanitized!	&&&
"The Staples Screen Cleaning Wipes are excellent for my computer, printer glass, cell phone screen, home land line phone screens, television sets,and eyeglasses. The compact dispenser is much handier than the flat pack Windex wipes we have used in the past.."	&&&
Love this product I use these everywhere in the house	&&&
These wipes are a must have for me at home and the office	&&&
Love Handi Wipes! Can't do without them, and I can't find them in stores any longer, so Amazon comes through!	&&&
I'm a Clorox user of 20 years and wouldn't trust my laundry or counter tops to anything else, love the fact that it cleans so well disinfects with a fresh smell, I even carry a can of Clorox wipes in my car!	&&&
bacteria killer will punish all your bacteria in a second	&&&
I use clorox wipes on pretty much everything in my house: wipe down bathroom, wipe down kitchen appliances, etc. It's very convenient especially when I just need to quickly wipe something up before I have company over. Clorox is a great product and I feel confident that most things in my home are sufficiently disinfected.	&&&
I love these!! I've tried other name brands (*cough*cough* Lysol*) and bargain brands but they just don't get the job done like Clorox brand does. I use these every single day to wipe off kitchen counters, door knobs, bathroom vanities/fixtures, and just about everything else. I like the actual material of the wipes better, too - they seem to be bigger, they hold a lot more of the cleaning product, and they don't rip easily. I honestly wouldn't even bother with other brands.	&&&
I have used these wipes since my son was born in 2011. He has very sensitive skin but has never had a problem with these wipes. They are super thick and wonderful! However, there has been a recent change in the ingredients and these wipes are no long the best around. They made my son break out in a rash terribly the first time I used them. They also smell horrible... WHY DID YOU CHANGE THEM?!?! I am very sad... I am having my second baby soon and am having to consider using another brand because of my recent experiences. Not happy :(	&&&
As a daycare owner great wipes are a necessity..These Huggies wipes are strong and get the job done..They are great for the little ones sensitive skin as well as toddlers who can create quite a mess. I love the value and the quality of these wipes..These are a must have for me..	&&&
I love colorox bleach I use it for everything from my laundry to cleaning everything else I use regular bleach to color bleach to wipes I just love Clorox bleach	&&&
I think this is the best disinfecting wipes available."}},	&&&
Very easy and convenient. Bad season for sicknesses. Use daily. I use every where. Kitchen, bathroom, door knobs and walls.	&&&
I've tried several other name-brand wipes, and this is by-far my favorite. I love how gentle they are for my sensitive baby plus they are soft. This is the ONLY brand wipes that our household uses. :)	&&&
I have a family of 6. We need to leave out and handy the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in our bathroom for all the "spills" around the toilet. In fact, the yellow container matches my bathroom and I keep it with my toilet paper in a wicker basket, ready for any spills one of the kids may have. Plus with it handy it makes it easy to wipe out the water stains in the toilet.	&&&
Best wipes ever!!	&&&
"We have purchased this value pack three times now for pet messes, but the texture of the wipes has been different each time we got them.

The first order texture was thicker/rougher and better for scrubbing messes.

The texture the second order was more like a thick tissue. It didn't easily tear at the perforation when pulling it through the dispenser, but would start to rip apart. It was frustrating having to use both hands to tear at the perforation. I gave up and didn't even pull through the dispenser in the lid. I thought about trying other wipes, but the price for the 3 pack is too good to beat.

Now the third order is back to the original texture??? It would be nice to know which version to expect when ordering!!"	&&&
These wipes don't actually wipe very well. I'm switching to chemical free products from pampers and I'm using 10x the wipes.	&&&
I bought these thinking they would be as good as the can of foam cleaner they sell. Big mistake. These leave horrible streaks on my car windows and indoor windows. Leave streaks on glass mirror too. Go with the foam.	&&&
I've used this product on my 2007 Wrangler for years. I use it on the hard top, fenders, and bumpers. I was referred to this product back in 2007, and I'm glad I have been applying it since. I would apply a few times a year to keep the plastic looking good. At the time of this review, the Jeep has 106,000 miles and looks great.	&&&
alright check it so i was expecting you know a nice cologne smell but nah it basically smells like a unscented baby wipe no "dude" about it. i mean the only thing thats worth it is the sinlge packaging of wet wipes whcich has kept the bum clean	&&&
love to useclorox in my toilet bowl it refreshes it i use disinfect wipes for the cleaning and fresh smell i will continue to use them and encourage eveyone to try any clorox brand	&&&
We donate these to our son's Kindergarten class cuz they're so great!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They're quick and easy to use, smell great, and clean like a champ!	&&&
Fresh smell can last up to 3 hours. Easy to use and convenient.	&&&
Clorox products do the job in one easy swipe Very happy with your products. I have recommended them to my company in the past which is a 339,000 square foot bldg and they buy your product in bulk	&&&
I love these wipes for a quick daily bathroom scrub. Just remember to use gloves.	&&&
Love the ease of use and disinfecting power of the wipes. Carry them everywhere.	&&&
Love Love Love these wipes. We use them at home and our school uses them in the classrooms!	&&&
I love Clorox products, it makes me feel like I have a clean home. I use the wipes to clean my bathrooms, so easy and they leave a nice fresh scent!	&&&
I take these wipes with me everywhere and use them for my daughter's hands as well as mine. I read that you have to wash your hands for 3 minutes to disinfect them. However, if you use wipes or liquid hand sanitizer, as soon as it dries you are good to go.	&&&
we use these for everything around our house. the wipes are so easy to use. we keep one in each bathroom for easy clean up	&&&
Love these wipes! These are all I will use to wipe down the bathrooms and kitchen.	&&&
I use them all the time quick and easy when you have kids :-)	&&&
I love the ease of using this product! Whenever I see something that needs cleaning I just pull out a wipe, clean and toss!!!	&&&
The wipes are convenient to use and have a good smell to them. I wish they dispensed better, they always get stuck.	&&&
Great wipes! We've used on our 17 month old since day one. Love the smell and they're pretty hardy.....able to withstand the messiest of diapers! We have this on the Subscribe and Save for every three months. Great wipe!	&&&
I bought these to use after the gym when im in a hurry and can't shower as soon as im done working out. They have worked good so far. My skin feels very clean afterwards, and seems to keep breakouts at bay. Wish the package came with more wipes, but other than that this works good	&&&
I love using this wipes on everything, especially after having my baby I have to keep everything disinfected.	&&&
I always have my kids help me clean and they love Clorox wipes. Its easier for them and for me.	&&&
"These lysol wipes are so wonderful. they are very handy and easy to use.
they smell great and leave any surface looking and feeling very clean. I wish all products would work this well. the price was perfect for the product and the quality. I love staples and all there products. alot of the other wipes dont really clean as good as the lysol wipes do. All you have to do is wipe the surface with the lysol wipes and let it dry and then its ready to use. I would recommend this product to anyone .
lysol wipes are the way to go""}},"	&&&
My, oh my! Does it help to have 3 pack of disinfecting wipes around the house? Yes it does! As a full time mother in the deep Southern region of our great United States of America, I can testify that no other brand is as good at removing day to day stains such as dirt, mud, grass, squirrel blood, and oatmeal! The wipes never dry out and leave the trailer lemony fresh! A must have!	&&&
Its great and id use it again in the long run!!Its great	&&&
Great product! I highly recommend all germaphobes (like me) to give it a try!	&&&
I have been purchasing Clorox products for years. I love the disenfecting wipes because they are so convenient and easy to use to clean up around my home.	&&&
"These easy to use wipes, will be a big help as you go through winter. You will have to use a lot of wipes though, to get yourself a tan. You can probably tan yourself up to 6 times with this box, maybe more and maybe less. When you do get a tan, you will notice that you have no streaks and you are not orange. I would gladly use these instead of going and using a tanning bed.

I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion."	&&&

"for the flu season and all year keep things clean and disinfected easy to use wipes in hand container

great price!""}}];"	&&&
"These wipes are a cross between kleenex and diaper wipes, meant for wiping little noses. They're very gentle, softer than diaper wipes but just as moist. They are packaged conveniently, easy to pull out of the package, and the top snaps securely to keep them from drying out. My son hates having his nose wiped but these make the task much easier."	&&&
Having young kids, I am always concerned about germs in my home. I love using Clorox products and knowing that I am getting a nice lemon smell, as well as disinfecting.	&&&
I love these wipes! They're soft, natural, and effective. They don't irritate my daughter's skin or leave a film, like some other wipes do. I feel good knowing I'm using such a natural product on her delicate skin. They have a very neutral smell too. Love everything babyganics makes.	&&&
I LOVED THE FRESH WIPES. MY BABY HAD NO PROBLEM WITH SKIN IRRITATION AND REDNESS AS HE DID WITH SOME OF OTHER BRANDS WE HAVE TRIED.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes! They are thick, soft, and clean up messes really well! I'm purchasing more.	&&&
they are good when the grandkids come to clean up messes!!!!	&&&
If 2.5 stars were an option, this would be my rating. I bought two cases of these and I will not be buying more. To put things into perspective, I would give Honest Company and Costco wipes five stars and Target wipes four stars. My toddler is pretty close to being fully potty trained so I've used a lot of wipes. Here are the pros: (1) the price is good, (2) the ingredients are fully listed and are good for the most part, (3) it's strong, and (4) they truly are good for sensitive skin. Cons: (1) They are not moist enough. It takes twice as many of these to clean up a poop. (2) The synthetic material is not very absorbant and if you fold it in half, it slides against itself. I've gotten a lot of poop on my hands as a result of this. (3) It's only textured on one side. The texture pattern is too big so it really does not do anything. (4) The pop out design is poor. If you pull on it, like 10 of them come out. Overall, the biggest flaw is the weird, almost hydrophobic, material that it's made out of and the poor texture. It takes twice as many wipes to get the job done and they create many more messes.	&&&
We use these to clean the kitchen counters, or even the floor when something spills. We use the bathroom ones to clean the bathroom too.	&&&
I like Clorox disinfecting wipes because of the great cleaning power and smell! A name I can trust!	&&&
got these on sale. usually dont purchase wipes, just use spray with paper towels, but thought i would try these. for the price on sale it couldnt hurt. they smell great. they are a bit small, but for quick jobs it didnt matter much. i havent found them to dry out in the bottle, but what I did find was that they are a bit difficult to get out. you are supposed to pull up thru an area where they stay, but when i pulled i got more than one and they all got stuck. so now i just pull out from the center and rip off exactly what i need. i will watch for these on sale again in the 3 pack."}}];	&&&
These wipes smell nice, and are soft, however they are slippery smooth which makes it a little difficult to wipe a dirty baby bum sometimes. If you like really smooth, soft wipes, these are for you. If you like sturdier ones, I wouldn't recommend them.	&&&
I love these. They are great for everyday messes and wiping down the counters	&&&
I wanted to try these wipes as they are advertised as a 3 in 1. They are very nice, though I do think other brands are equally good for their use. I only need one to remove the makeup, though I do concentrate on getting the mascara off and it works very well.	&&&
Not very sturdy ,also found in stores.	&&&
"These wash clothes feel great on sensitive skin and make a big difference when washing little ones. They are the perfect size and soft. Other washcloths either are or become scratchy and can really irritate mine and my daughters skin but so far these haven't. I love that they are all natural and as long as I hane wash them I don't have to worry about chemicals or dyes breaking my skin out. They are machine washable but I prefer to hand wash them. They com six to a pack which is also a plus because most wash clothes this soft are usually individually bought or three to a pack. My skin is much smoother and I don't have bumps from break outs due to wash clothes or loofahs like in the past. I definitely recommend these to anyone with sensitive skin.

I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
Smells great, got a good deal on these.	&&&
As other reviewers have mentioned, these wipes have an odd rectangular shape. The long but slender wipes are so awkward to use it doesn't feel like we are getting our hands very clean at all.	&&&
Decided to try these wipes out since amazon had a coupon available. They are nice and thick, and pop up nicely from the bag. I would compared them to huggies in feel. I really like them.	&&&
I received this product as part of influenster in order to test it out. I absolutely love it. Some people say the sheets are too large, but it makes it easier to just use one! And my skin doesn't feel stripped or weighed down with residue and chemicals. Love it! The fragrance is standard to most but a little less abrasive than other brands.	&&&
Love this product	&&&
"Have bought these for years. The scent is nice but not too strong. The material is soft and gentle on the skin but strong enough that you won't put your fingers through it. Good for babies, kids and adults. These wipes contain no alcohol which is rather nice.

Do note they are not flushable and not safe for septic systems."	&&&
easy to use and great price for these	&&&
I love pampers swipes. They are always fresh and good scent. They help me clean good for baby anywhere and anytime. I just love them.	&&&
I received a free sample through generation good and used it on my daughter. It was a thick wipe and didn't rip in the process of getting her clean. There was also no breakout on her skin like there is with other wipe brands. Thinking of making the switch to seventh generation! Also, I'm studying to become an environmental scientist so everything this company tries to do really appeals to me, I'm trying to go as green as possible and seventh generation definitely helps! :)	&&&
I am a deer hunter with glasses which fog in the cold air. They seemed to help a little but not enough to make me buy again	&&&
Smell great, work well.	&&&
I use these wipes for various things around the house. My favorite use is for cleaning my mobile devices, as they become very dirty and can collect germs easily. The value pack makes them an even better purchase and allows me to keep a tub in the car, my work vehicle and around the house."}},	&&&
When ever I have a baby shower to go to, I just go on Amazon. Some how I always find some great deals.	&&&
I was using Pampers sensitive for the first 2 months until I had to make a quick run to Target to get wipies since they were running out and I started debating whether Huggies or Pampers, then i quickly searched for the Huggies reviews and saw how many switched from Pampers to Huggies wipes so I did the trade too and it was the best deicision ever. You know those massive poop attacks babies have? We all know they are very messy to clean it would take up to 7 wipes from Pampers to clean but with Huggies it took 3, I was amazed at how thick it was, it wasn't very wet, it was perfect. Im not switching back, they're perfect!!!	&&&
It doesn't hold a lot of wipes. I had a stack of maybe 15-20 wipes and it wouldn't close. It doesn't snap closed tightly and if the wipes are left in there, they will dry out.	&&&
"Love sanitizing but hate going to the grocery store? I DO!
Because guess what, the last thing I want to do when I am sick is slog to the store in my faded yoga pants (you know the ones you don't actually wear for yoga because you actually don't do yoga, and the pants are too long anyway and drag the ground making you feel extra gross), and pick up Clorox wipes in an attempt to keep the rest of your family from catching your vile illness.
Thank the lord for Amazon and fast shipping.
Get these, get Prime, and get moving with that cleaning!"	&&&
We love having our diapers and wipes on Subscribe and Save. We get a great price and they are delivered to our door each month. We save both time and money!	&&&
i love this product! its easy to use and gets rid of bad odors. i have a puppy and a two year old and these are a must have in my house!	&&&
Thank you for a great product. Easy to use, and smell nice.	&&&
Love this product! It is the only thing that gets the germs off of the common areas where illness seems to get spread in my home.	&&&
"i take clorox wipes om long driving trips- i can disinfect table surfaces at fast food, the potty if necessary
and wipe the sink hanfles on faucets beforw i use them. that way i am not getting or giving any germs like flu or viruses that i do not want."	&&&
My baby was super sensitive to the pampers sensitive wipes. The pampers left a chemical film and did not allow my babies bottom to dry quickly.The chemicals also gave him diaper rash and thrush. Our doctor and a friend told us to just use paper towels with water. My husband and I tried this, but it was requiring us to run back and forth between the bathroom to get water, plus our baby won't lay still enough for us to prepare the wet paper towel. We opted for the water wipes and they are awesome. There are no chemicals, no smell and they work really well. I gave them four stars because they come out of the pack in bunches so it is easy to waste wipes. this costs us more money.	&&&
Tried using other methods but end up coming back to this. Easy to use and is effective. Favorite one is the citrus scented wipes.	&&&
A must have in every household with young children! Thank you, Clorox!	&&&
I use the wipes when I go on vacation to do a quick bathroom clean up at hotels. The bathroom is never clean. I don't know who's dirty I am coming in contact with. Clorox wipes takes my worries away.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are great for babies since there are no chemicals and other unnecessary ingredients. I've been using these on my 4 month old since she was born and she hasn't had a single diaper rash thank God!!! The only reason im giving this a 4 star and not a 5 star is because the wipes do not overlap so sometimes it becomes inconvenient when you need to use more. I have to take them out ahead of time, and i also keep them in a huggies plastic container.	&&&
Best wipes ever. They're not sticky. They're soft but at the same time they clean well.	&&&
"I was very disappointed when my local Sam's Club stopped caring these soft wipes as I had purchased them for several years and really felt that they were the best wipes I had ever used!
I was extremely happy to find out that Sam's Club Online carried them, so I ordered 6 boxes. Some for myself and some for my friends that had become addicted to them after I had introduced these great wipes to them.
They outperform and other wipe I have tried and I always have them in my vehicles so I can disinfect my hands easily; I also always keep at least one in my pants pocket.
They are a great size and very, very moist. I just hope Sam's Club Online keeps stocking them so I will have a source to buy them."	&&&
The tamper inside that is supposed to hold down the wipes sits loose…it seems I always get two or three wipes at a time…not worth $19.99 but it is better than anything else out there...	&&&
"Recently switched to cloth wipes and keep them in this warmer, night and day!!! My little girl really loves the warm wipes I feel bad my son didn't have this when he was an infant! I'll never go back to disposable cold chemical wipes again!!
I take my cloth wipes that I made out if organic cotton flannel and get them wet in warm water, I soak the pad and apply a couple drops of tea tree oil on the bottom (the side that doesn't touch the wipes) this keeps the bacteria out and a nice spa like scent. I can keep at least 4 days worth if wipes in here. When I run out I rinse the pad and start over."	&&&
I love these wipes! My little one has not had a rash since I switched...going on over 3 months.	&&&
love it give me more please..................................................	&&&
I used Clorox wipes daily in my kitchen, bathrooms and laundry.	&&&
I love the wipes because they are very convenient and cleans and disinfects very ell especially with children.	&&&
i love it when its clean! it disinfects everything	&&&
Huggies makes the best wipes, hands down, and with Subscribe & Save, these are cheaper than store brands.	&&&
I have an infant and dog and things can get pretty messy. Clorox wipes helps clean up messes really easily.	&&&
Our go-to for baby wipes. They're gentle, but get the job done!	&&&
LOVE these... they are my go to wipes for cleaning from kitchen down to the toilet... they have cut my cleaning time.... Highly recommended....	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are cleaning staple in our house. We use them daily. Clorox wipes are especially great for quick clean ups in the kitchen and bathrooms. They are convenient, easy to use and they disinfect and leave the room smelling clean and fresh.. even the kids clean up after themselves!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They are convenient are do a great job cleaning all are the home and office	&&&
Easy to use in the classroom and takes the ink/pencil marks right off the desks while disinfecting!!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because they are so easy to use and you know it is sanitizing while you work. The lemon scent is great and makes everything seem clean.	&&&
Handy container to store the wipes. I actually keep them in the kitchen at my office to wipe my fingers and hands when making lunch or use for a quick wipe up. Love it that it fits in small spaces.	&&&
Seemed great, but wipes do dry out after a while	&&&
Best product for the awful job of cleaning the bathroom. Clorox has a product for everything!	&&&
I like that I can grab this wipe, know that I am disinfecting and then throw it away when I am done. As a mom of 6, there is enough laundry to deal with!	&&&
I love these wipes everytime I clean the bathroom it wipes up all the grime...	&&&
Use these wipes in the kitchen and bathrooms on a daily basis.	&&&
great product, can really clean and smell really good.	&&&
This is the only wipes we use in our house cause it is the best! My grandmother gets upset when I don't keep enough in the house! Love it! Use it for any and everything.	&&&
Great product. Worth every penny spent. We will purchase again!	&&&
Love having it shipped right to my door. These things last me forever and are great with 2 kids and a dog terrorizing the house. Quick and easy to just grab a wipe and clean up whatever spill/mess/etc has been left behind. I keep one upstairs and two downstairs so they're always handy. I would recommend this product to others.	&&&
I like the travel size of this wipes on the go case, but it seems that the wipes dry out a bit. They're not as wet when sitting in this case for a while. But, I will keep using the case, hopefully the flaw was that I left the case open and the wipes dried out. Giving this case another chance.	&&&
"I tried a lot of different wipes as I wanted something that would do a good job cleaning my son up while in restaurants or parks that was all natural, good for wiping his face with, and durable enough that one or two wipes would do the job. These were the clear winners and I've been using them for two years now.

My only issue? They currently cost $34 here when they used to cost me $22 (also here on Amazon). I understand supply and demand, but this is ridiculous. It is cheaper for me to buy them by the single pack at Whole Foods right now!

So for those considering these, a little shopping around might save you a lot of money. Especially if you find that you go through packs of these quickly...like we do in the summer."	&&&
I bought these wipes for my 1 month old baby, and I love that he has not had a rash since switching to these wipes. Will continue to purchase this item and I recommend to babies with sensitive skin.	&&&
Product arrived as described and earlier than expected. The product is as smooth as silk sheets leaving one to question why they have not been using this product for longer. Would highly recommend.	&&&
Wipes are very strong and one is usually enough to clean away even the really messy diapers. Wipes don't dry out my baby's skin and the scent isn't overwhelming.	&&&
Kids drop everything, and I'm a Germaphobe... These are a godsend! I don't go anywhere without them! I recommend them highly!	&&&
These wipes are our 911! We use them as a replacement for regular bath as well as for elimination of possible daily dirt. And we also clean cat's outer ear with these. Cat doesn't mind us using these wipes!	&&&
These are great wipes but I personally prefer the Sensitive line of wipes.	&&&
Yet again, shocked at the amazing quality from Pampers. I was at a friends house, and i ran out of wipes and had to borrow a few from her. I only had to use one wipe! It was so gentle on my baby's bottom, & cleaned it so very thorough. Now I buy Pampers wipes too!	&&&
We were getting them every month from Amazon. Recently we noticed that this stuff does not smell good. May be it stayed in UPS truck and boiled.	&&&
"It is everything the package says it is!
There's soooo many for such a great price! Of course you get bang for your buck buying an economy pack; and this saves a quite a bit of money!
Soft and strong is right!"	&&&
For some reason every time I purchase these I get numerous wipes that rip apart in the package. I wish they were stronger because nothing is more irritating than only getting a portion of a wipe when trying to clean up a squirming toddler. "	&&&
Not only are these wipes organic, but they do not have harsh chemicals that give my baby a rash. Other popular brands are known to irritate the skin causing horrible rashes. These wipes do not! Highly recommend.	&&&
I love this it's not so boxy , I have it strapped to the diaper bag so no digging , also have one hanging in the car for easy quick access !! And a great gift to moms	&&&
these wipes are so useful to have around the house! i use them for everything. i have pets, so they are great for wiping down litter boxes, cleaning up throw-up, urine_, etc. since these are safe for babies, i feel safe using them for cleaning instead of detergent-type wipes, which might hurt my pets.	&&&
These wipes have been a lifesaver for me as I am frequently out of the office for work. After putting the milk in storage bags, I use the wipes to also clean the bottles. The wipes allow for me to carry less breast pumping supplies. I plan to include these in baby shower gifts from now on.	&&&
I have tried the cheaper wipes and it takes two or three times the amount of wipes to do what pampers can do. In he end, I have learned I won't save any money with going with something besides pampers!	&&&
These are the only wipes I will ever use again! My son has extremely sensitive skin and these wipes are BY FAR the best quality! They get the job done, but are so gentle!	&&&
These wipes are awesome! They are very resistant and I've tried other wipes and they tear easily... not these. They also don't irritate my babies sensitive bottom.	&&&
I like the wipes because of the scent. It smells well and is not strong for the baby. However, the wipe is too wet and I have to use a washcloth to dry my baby. When you buy the wipes in large packages; I have to find a way to keep it from drying because once you open it there is no way to close it back like huggies.	&&&
When I think of baby fresh smell, I think of these wipes. Wonderful clean and feel. These are the kind of wipes you would use on everything, not just a diaper change.	&&&
These are great! I feel like things are actually clean after I use them! Wonderful for when there's a sickness floating around your house or a really easy, quick disinfection.	&&&
I use it to clean my sons teeth and gums, but it seems like he does not like anything in his mouth.they dont taste bad because i have tried them out before him, but he seems to just lick on them.i find them useful and i well continue to use the full pack, but i don't think i would but them again.	&&&
This is the second floor mate I have bought. When it works it does a great job. The problem comes when it stops picking up the dirty water. i have had this problem with both Hoover Floor Mates. I'm now using a wet vac to pick up the water after I use the Floor Matel. This makes the job a lot harder.	&&&
I am using this product for application of mouse/rat repellent and it works perfectly! This is quite the opposite of using it on a child, but it certainly shows that it has a range of uses.	&&&
I found a much better product (Pledge wood spray) for cleaning my dining table and I thought why did I buy this product. I would say do not invest in this product.	&&&
If you've ever traveled on a long international flight then you know how critical it is to have this product. My day started at 6am which included checking out of my hotel shortly after. It was a very cold day but we had long walking tours all day and then boarded a 12.5 hour International flight at 11:30pm that night. Needless to say this product was the next best thing!! Great for sensitive skin, no irritants and makes you feel refreshed!	&&&
Yes am very happy with the order.	&&&
Love using these wipes to keep my leather handbags clean! It's easy, convenient and no mess. It did not harm the leather on any of my bags, and there was no color transfer. I was able to use one wipe on two large leather bags. I also used it on the canvas of my LV bags, with no problem. I followed up with the Cadillac Boot & Shoe Conditioner, allowed to dry about 15 minutes and buffed my bags with a dry cotton cloth or towel. It preserves the leather to prevent drying and possible cracking. I store my bags in dust bags after. On my most used bags, I will clean and condition about every 6 months, and about once a year on the bags I do not use frequently. I am very happy Nordstrom carries this product!	&&&
I absolutely love everything about Clorox products, the smell, the thorough cleaning it produces and the price!	&&&
The clorox disinfecting wipes take care of so many household needs; like cleaning countertops, grease, and even dust. There convenient, smell good, and don't take up as much room as other cleaners do to them being in a canister. I would definitely recommend these to my friends.	&&&
Absolutely love Clorox! I have used Clorox clean up and Clorox gallons for years! Clorox wipes are amazing! Will never use anything else)	&&&
I love having the wipes handy in my kitchen and bathroom for a quick clean. Easy for my kid to use which is helpful and saves me time and energy.	&&&
I adore my clorox wipes and they truly do cut through kitchen grease! These are a must have in my home and we never run out!!!!!	&&&
Clorox Wipes are great to disinfect door knobs, phones and I use it to clean toilet seats, rims and faucet handles. Also love the spray Clorox Clean up for all things. It kills so many germs better than other brands. Clorox has become a staple at my house. North Carolina	&&&
I've used Clorox my whole life and have to say it does wonders and never fells to surprise me with all it can do!	&&&
these wipes work great!	&&&
They are great to use at work for cleaning the desk.	&&&
The case does not close very good so the wipes dry out.	&&&
I use clorox wipes for everything in my house. Thanks you for such a great product	&&&
I use these at work to clean and kill germs that normal wipes won't kill. They don't smell very good and I recommend using gloves when using them (turned my fingers and hands white). Otherwise a great product and will buy again!	&&&
Clorox wipes are easy to use. I enjoy the convenience. Thank you.	&&&
Perfect item to keep in your purse or baby bag at all times! These little wipes have probably saved me several trips to the doctors with the little ones! There's nothing worse than having your child's pacifier fall on the ground & them wanting it back immediately, germ filled and all, to put directly back into their mouths! Yuck! These Arm and Hammer Pacifier wipes have become a necessity in my book! Don't leave the house without them! -Amy B.	&&&
Clorox wipes are quick and easy to use. Its gets the job done and cuts cleaning time down	&&&
Clorox Disinfectig wipes have saved my family so many times. They are easy for the kids to use by their selfs and safe.	&&&
Love these wipes! Perfect for when you're rushing somewhere after a workout and don't have time to shower. They smell nice and leave you rskin feeling great!	&&&
Love these wipes. Clean up anything and everything.	&&&
It is a great product. It is unscented with a touch of aloe. It is strong wipes!	&&&
These wipes clean just as good as some name brand ones. They smell great and are easy on my baby's bottom too. You can't beat the price for a 3 pack of these either! I love how they have the plastic open/close lid, as I put a pack in my diaper bag.	&&&
It's so easy to use Clorox Wipes! And, knowing that I'm keeping my family safe is reassuring.	&&&
I love the travel sizes. I keep at least one at my desk and it doesn't take up a lot of space.	&&&
Love it, use them everywhere.	&&&
Great wipes without all the nasty chemicals and unnecessary fragrances. My only complaint is the packaging. I repeatedly pull out more than one wipe at a time, but atleast you can easily put the excess back. The other nice thing is the wipes are very moist all the way to the last one!	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. We keep them everywhere in the house. They are gentle and soft on my baby's bottom. I highly recommend them.	&&&
I jump at the chance to clean the bathroom when I know I have Clorox Disinfecting Wipes on hand. It makes the job quick and easy, and they leave my surfaces sparkling.	&&&
I've been buying thiese lotion wipes in Milk & Honey for about a year now. They smell so good and really are refreshing. I highly recommend this product because it does exactly what it says!	&&&
Use these all the time especially with all the colds going around!	&&&
With the flu season I like to know its clean and germs are gone.	&&&
I love clorox!! These wipes have cut my cleaning time in half and can be used all over the house in the car and anywhere!!	&&&
Clorox wipes make my cleaning tasks so much easier.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes. They are great to use for multiple purposes.	&&&
Clorox is easy to use and has great disinfecting properties.	&&&
I have a weakness for fried foods==the wipes are great for cleanup!	&&&
Use in the kitchen all the time. Makes cleaning up spills easy and disinfects!	&&&
I love clorox wipes. We use them in the kitchen and bathroom and even outside.	&&&
One of favorites, I always have one in my car, at work, bathroom, kitchen and my bedroom. This product is a must when you have lots of little ones around.	&&&
Clorox® Disinfecting Wipes are the easiest way to make sure your house is clean and disinfected. No sprays or paper towels and rags needed.	&&&
Quick and easy to clean up a toddler-made mess while holding a baby..	&&&
Wipes are very thick and are very gentle	&&&
My son's preschool uses these everyday. Very convenient.	&&&
these are quick easy wipes to use for everyday use we you them all the time at our house from kitchen bath and even outdoor use is great too	&&&
Use daily in household maintenance. Wipe doorknobs, refrigerator doors, counters, and great cleaning up messy stove top. Great for wiping down bathroom between users.	&&&
This is a amazing product! You won't be sorry if you try it!!!	&&&
Love the convenience the wipes offer with being able to quickly disinfect surfaces that my children come into regular contact with.	&&&
Like these wipes, and has a nice scent.	&&&
Great product! This product always works on all stains. Use it for a number of different reasons. Works on everything	&&&
If your kids do not have sensitive skin these wipes are great. Great value for a great product, just not as gentle and soft s the sensitive wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are convenient for cleaning and disinfecting my bathroom. I love them!	&&&
My daughter has a rare bone marrow disease that makes getting rid of germs a MUST. I appreciate the ease of being able to grab a Clorox wipe and know I don't have to worry as much! Thanks!	&&&
I live in a small 2-bedroom apartment. It's important to me that my apartment look clean and is sanitized. I have two clorox containers, one in each bathroom. I realized I need to have one in each room of the house. With our lives being so busy today, I use the wipes as I go, cleaning mirrors, counters, toilet, everything that I can reach quickly. It makes cleaning so much faster and efficient. It's a great tool for everyday-upkeep, making the day of the major housekeeping so much easier. I absolutely love it. I just wish that I could carry the Clorox container in my purse, like the windex wipes. They're flat and easy to carry. I'd like to carry it in my purse and wipe restaurant toilet seats or public tables, at school, if I need to sit down and eat. Love you guys! Rosane	&&&
i LOVE clorox wipes they make my everyday cleaning very easy especially when theres a two year old around lol... clorox wipes are great!	&&&
I love how everything feels so clean and disinfected after using Clorox wipes!	&&&
Great for my puppy who loves to track in mud and dirt. Smell is nice and mild, and my dog has had no reaction to the wipes at all. Only complaints are that sheets don't pull out smoothly (oftentimes bunch up and have to be shoved back inside to stay moist), and that in one of my orders the sheets were much dryer than before.	&&&
"I love these wipes for quick cleanup, and they also work well to clean pet spots on the carpet. However, I am sensitve to strong scents, and these do smell quite strong. They are also not ideal for pets since pets do not like citrus. I mainly use them right before I empty the trash so I can immediately throw away and carry out the used wipes to minimize the scent. The 3-pack is also nice because I can put a new canister in multiple rooms. Plus, Staples had them on sale for a really good price."	&&&
when i use this product it makes me feel like everything is really clean and disinfected. Gives me peace of mind with my kids running around.	&&&
I love every product of Clorox I have used so far. My favorite are the Clorox wipes! I use them everyday to wipe down the counters in my house. I like that they don't give off a bleach smell like some other cleaners.	&&&
It disinfect surfaces very well. It make your house smells really clean.	&&&
"Clorox wipes are in each bathroom, my kitchen, my office. Very convenient and clean smell."	&&&
Was excited to get the product, but couldn't get a single wipe out without it ripping to pieces. It also wouldn't pull the next wipe through no matter how slowly I pulled them. I tried placing the wipes in different ways but never worked. Only wasted a lot of wipes.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They are so convenient to use and I can clean almost anything with them.. it also makes me feel better using something that disinfects considering I have a toddler	&&&
Clorox products are excellent products. great with little kids	&&&

I have used Clorox products since I've been helping my mom with cleaning as a kid. She used your products so when i moved out and on my own that's the brand I always reached for when I needed to clean up a mess, disinfect something, and whiten clothes. It's the brand I grew up around and its the brand that will always be in my home.	&&&
I can't live without Clorox wipes! All I use are the disinfecting wipes to clean down toys, spills, countertops, my bathroom or anything else that I see fit.	&&&
I really like Clorox products because it gives my house a clean fresh smell. I use it 3 to 4 times a week. Thanks Clorox	&&&
ALWAYS USE, AND IT IS THE BEST CLEANING SUPPLY EVER.	&&&
I love Clorox! It Cleans very well and smells great.	&&&
I have 5 young children, so I always need to clean up quickly. Clorox wipes are my favorite choice for every room and every mess.	&&&
Absolutely the best cleaning wipes I've ever used!	&&&
i LOVE THE WIPES. THEY ARE GREAT WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING UP AFTER MY DOGS. THEY ARE VERY CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE.	&&&
YES! I have used all those sunless self tanning gels and creams but they always make me look orange, streaky, or it goes on darker in certain spots! These wipes are so much better than all of that! Your palms won't turn dark, and you get really great coverage! It only takes about 4 hours, but the tan is perfectly even! The best part? There is NO SMELL! I hate the way all the creams smell. You have to use at least 2-3 towels to get full body coverage, but if you don't do areas that are covered all the time, you can get away with 1!	&&&
Love this product its something that i use all the time and so does my family.	&&&
Makes cleaning up easier and doesn't leave as bad of streaks as other products	&&&
LOVE Pampers sensitive wipes! It seems like I've tried EVERY wipe out there and the Pampers Sensitive Wipes are the ONLY wipes that don't give my two little boys a rash or raw skin after their diaper changes. Even the generic ones which say that they are "comparable to" Pampers Sensitive Wipes don't work! How would you feel walking (or crawling) around all day with a red, raw, rash covered but?? I will never ever try another wipe on my babies ever again! -Amy B.	&&&
I loved this for our cloth wipes, but after about a year the plug stopped working. It looks like it shorted out because of the moisture in the container. Apparently, this is a common complaint with these warmers. So, while it did a good job for us (as long as I changed out the wipes frequently so they didn't start stinking like mildew), I won't be buying another.	&&&
I Love The convince of the disinfecting wipes. It's especially helpful when you have a house full of the flu and viruses.	&&&
"Got two of these for very cheap. Work fantastic. Had some difficulty getting each opened and the dispenser started but once we got those figures out, they work wonderfully. Have one ready as a back up :-)"	&&&
I LOVE THE CONVENIENCE OF CLOROX WIPES AND I ALWAYS USE CLOROX IN MY LAUNDRY.	&&&
I buy these wipes for a wipe board that the kids use in my kitchen to write notes, draw pictures, make list or leave reminders. We have an eraser for the dry erase markers but after time it looks really blah, so we use these wipes and it cleans it right up just like new AND Staples is the only place that I can find them!"}},	&&&
These are the best brand of wipes we have ever used. The closest thing to clean cotton and pure water!	&&&
everyone should try this product we use in ALL the time in our home and we love it! it smells great also!	&&&
It is flu season and I don't want to get sick, so I use clorox wipes when anyone comes over.	&&&
These hold up better than the other brands. I've tried them all and this one doesn't rip or fall apart as easy as the other brands like pampers and parent choice do when pulling them through the opening of the warmer. I gave the rating of good, because I've had a couple rip on me from the last package of wipes. This is still better than the wipes ripping every time or every other time.	&&&
I like this products, its very easy to use and it works well!	&&&
"This Product Rocks!
The wipes are convenient and powerful."	&&&
Love love love! Huggies wipes are always great quality! Compared to other brands they stay moist and don't rip! And wipe clean very well!	&&&
I use this on days when I'm too lazy to use makeup remover. One wipe removes all my foundation and other makeup. The scent is refreshing as well. I have sensitive skin especially around my eyes and this item does not irritate it at all. I tried wipes from the Body Shop and reacted horribly. These are gentle enough that it does not make me break out nor sting. Will definitely be using these for the rest of my life.	&&&
I was afraid to buy these at first because I had heard thier were tiny glass shards in them. I bought them because of an amazing deal and I opened a pack and saw something sparkly and I immediately thought they have glass I checked them in the window so the sun could hit through them and it was just droplets of water I also wiped my arms and legs with them to be completely sure and they were fine.These baby wipes are very moist and they do not fall apart in your hand so you have nothing to worry about when your cleaning a baby.	&&&
As described. Thank you!	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. My baby has sensitive skin and these wipes soothe my baby's skin.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are my go to cleaner to make sure my home is clean and germ free. I use them for anything from wiping down countertops to door knobs and telephones. They are a great addition to my cleaning arsenal!	&&&
so glad they brought the original wipes back, love them	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting wipes are the best product I've ever used. When it comes to cleaning up a mess and making sure the area is clean Clorox wipes are the best.	&&&
With little ones running all over my house this is a great easy product to use to disinfect my whole house and almost effortless	&&&
Great! Cleans countertops easy and you know the germs are gone!	&&&
Huge disappointment from Seventh Generation? We have been ordering these wipes for two years and this shipment the wipes were different - they quilting with the little leaves and ducks was gone and the whole wipe was flimsy and too stretchy. The travel packs in retail stores seem to still be the old kind of wipe, but these new refills were awful and we've had to switch brands.	&&&
Amazing product! Works wonderfully and easy and make sure you read directions and do what they say! Product went on easy and no streaks or orange nasty color nope I applied it 1 time first day then again 2nd day Love it all my friends and family are asking me where did i go lol Plus it comes with 20 wipes! Best tanner i ever tried love it!!!	&&&
I am so glad that I found this product. I have lately started to become allergic to toilet paper.I had bad rashes for about three months - within a week of using this product, they were gone. I tried other other wipes like Cottonell that just made matters worse. As far as getting the wipes out of the packaging, I just lightly cup the package in my hand and get the wipes out by lightly pulling the wipe up and then down - works every time! I also put the wipes (keeping them in their packaging) inside a Cottonell container.	&&&
Really good product. Can handle most cleaning problems. If need a lot of scrubbing, might have to use another product that allows scrubbing. Your everyday and semi-hard problems are really cleaned with the wipes.	&&&
I use these wipes for everything!!! From cleaning messes on the floors, counter-tops, walls, doors, etc.	&&&
This product is perfect if you like to clean with mold. It's gross that a baby company find mold on wipes acceptable. There needs to be a recall.	&&&
I use these to wipe my pump parts clean in between pumpings while I'm at work. I like these a lot more than the Medela wipes because the Medela wipes are really really moist. These are moist, but don't leave wetness on my parts so they dry faster. These are a little smaller and thinner than the Medela ones , but they still work great.	&&&
I couldn't be more please with something that is So convenient!	&&&
All the above!! I have faith in all Clorox products!	&&&
The small $4.00 pack might seem like a bad value especially considering you can go to any store and get a full 20-25 pack for the same price. However, I love them. They work well and are the perfect size for my purse. I dont have room in my purse to hold a full pack of wipes so I love these for a quick fix if my makeup looks bad.	&&&
I love the smell of these wipes.	&&&
My whole family has used Germ-X Antibacterial Soft Wipes Singles for years. They are effective and very convenient to carry and use anywhere. Would not be without them. We love them!	&&&
We love Clorox wipes! They are convenient to use on the go. We keep them in our house, our car, and at work. There are other disinfecting wipes on the market, but we choose Clorox because of the high quality and trusted formula!	&&&
Best wipes on the market! Extremely soft, yet durable. Plenty of moisture, as always, but the free dispenser box is lower quality than I expected. Don't let that stop you from ordering these tho, they are the BEST! And this is coming from a father with extremely high standards as my daughters' bottom gets only the best :)	&&&
i always use clorox wipes to clean my SUV i have a dauthger of 2 years and she always spread rests of food and leaks and clorox get off all...	&&&
Growing up when my mother had my younger siblings she only used pampers products. So once I got pregnant I knew that was the brand I wanted to invest my money in especially after doing research. When my little man was born I was able to try out the pampers swaddlers because that's what they had at the hospital and I loved it! The pampers are so soft and comfortable while the wipes are non scented with lots of moisture. I have no complaints with this product it's my everyday use f or my 2 month old besides the huggies that other people would buy for him	&&&
Amazing wipes! We had always used huggies natural care and never could find wipes that worked as well until these... these work just as well are cheaper and you get more!	&&&
The glass cleaning wipes are my favorite. They're so easy to use and very effective! It's much better than using a spray AND paper towel.	&&&
With three sweet Scotty dogs in our home there is always something to clean. I use the wipes to clean up the urine messes on my wood floors and their beds get pretty stinky sometimes and when I clean their kennels I always use Clorox wipes because I know that their kennels will smell clean and have a nice fragrance.	&&&
I love these they are really convenient. I just wish they were cheaper!	&&&
I love these because it is simple and easy to use. Keeps things clean so I don't have to worry about it.	&&&
I couldn't deal with the overpowering fragrance and had to wash it off. Strong perfumes give me headaches. For a sensitive skin product, I don't know why they added a fragrance. The wipes did leave my skin soft, but the smell was so strong that it wasn't worth it.	&&&
I love the wipes they are so easy to use and I always have them on hand	&&&
very good product. we use it every where in our home	&&&
I use these to disinfect almost everything and love the fresh smell.	&&&
I use these for everything. They smell great and are super convenient.	&&&
As a mother of three boys, I appreciate the disinfecting wipes most. They make it easy to clean up after boys with "not-so-perfect" aim. And they are fantastic for cleaning up everything everyone touches during cold and flu season!	&&&
i absolutely love theses wipes they really get the job done and they do not give my baby a rash also their very soft	&&&
Hospital grade disinfectant wipes. Light, pleasantly scented. Used on trays, tables and counters (and cell phones) without problems. I should add, these are not wash-ups or hand sanitizers. Use gloves, avoid skin contact.	&&&
Other wipes leave a residue/film. This is the only wipe I'll ever use.	&&&
These wipes take off makeup so easily and smoothly, I was pleasantly surprised. There's no stringent feel, and no chemical odor (which is why I threw away the generic ones I had). And this package deal is great; sharing with my grown granddaughter keeps her out of my stuff.	&&&
love having a huge stash of wipes! worth ordering.	&&&
These wipes work great! I like to keep them under my bathroom and kitchen sink to quickly wipe down all the hard surfaces. They don't tear, even when I'm doing some hard scrubbing around the stove.	&&&
Very satisfied with wipes warmer zWiprs Warmer	&&&
These are great!! I consider them my all-purpose wipes. I keep a couple at home for the kitchen, bathroom and whatever else is needed. I also have a pack at work so it definitely provides for a better workspace also.	&&&
I haven't even used these wipes and already I hate them and will NOT be buying them again. The container isn't sealed at all! When the package arrived, it had leaked and was a big mess! Plus they are sure to dry out so much faster. This is not Rocket Science! Any idiot should know that a container needs a protective film to prevent such leakage.	&&&
Love all of the Clorox products but the wipes make It easier for my kiddos to help keep the house clean.	&&&
Very nice and convenient wipes. They produce a great shine on my furniture--but also leave some streaks.	&&&
The best wipes ever !!!	&&&
These are amazing! I have used other methods of cleaning stainless steel, but none really work that great. I decided to try these wipes since they were priced right and appeared easy to use. I wasn't disappointed, what a great find!"}},	&&&
I like using the wipes because they are convenient and disinfect!	&&&
I don't care for the way these smell and they are not soft at all.	&&&
"They smelled great"	&&&
Delivered. Thank you	&&&
Love these wipes- they are soft, leave no residue, do not have a strong smell and they are safe for my kids.	&&&
These wipes were recommended to us by my sister-in law. So glad she did because they are great! Sensitive enough on my baby's skin, but effective enough to keep him clean!	&&&
As a Mother of twins, a person can imagine how many wipes I go through in one day! The price of these wipes cannot be beat and they get the job done! Highly recommended them.	&&&
The scent was pleasant as I pulled out the first wipe and I was immediately disposed to like these wipes. However, they left a residue behind on my eyelids that left a film over my eyes on first use. Decided to be more careful on second use. This time my vision remained clear but my eyes watered and lids were sticky every time I blinked. TRULY wanted to LOVE these wipes as much as I love this brand eyeliner and shadows. Afraid this one did not make the cut.	&&&
This is my second warmer the first one the door would not close after a couple months of use and the 2nd one the cord that plugs in to the back does not stay plugged in and acts like it has a short in it. Needles to say its a guessing game rather the wipes will be warm or not.	&&&
These are my go to wipes! So soft and smell wonderful! And the shae butter just wipes of the poo so easily. Only wipes ill use!"	&&&
These wipes come in a nice solid container, that is easy to use. The wipes are gentle on my hands and my sons skin.	&&&
These individually wrapped wipes are great and we have been buying them at the local club for several years. All of a sudden, they stopped selling them at the clubs, and instead, are using a container that holds multiple wipes, which of course, end up drying out before you use all of them. Ordering the individual packs online adds $5.65 to the cost for shipping, since they're no longer available for pick up in the club. We'll have to find them elsewhere. Such a shame Sam's Club!	&&&
This is perfect for school during flu season. It is convenient to clean off desks knowing the germs are gone.	&&&
These are hands-down the BEST make up remover wipes I have ever used. Though I don't think they are ophthalmic rated, I experience no irritation when removing my eye makeup at night like I had with the Almay product. I use the wipes on my entire face and find them neither drying nor oily. They're great!	&&&
Great balance between softness and strong. I Love this wipes.	&&&
Started using these a few months ago and fell in love. Have always used their other bleach and cleaning products as well.	&&&
Poor, after using one of the wipes it streaks on the base and screen of the monitors. It took quite awhile and a lot of eyeglass cleaner to remove the streaks . The product was returned by to Staples for a refund."}}];	&&&
fiance is a clean freak. if i can get something i have to buy for her anyway for less than why not?	&&&
I LOVE the Clorox wipes. Easy to use and smell great. If just wiping off the high chair or cleaning the stove after a day full of cooking, this is my go to.	&&&
Tried the wipes from Costco (Kirklands brand) and they are super dry compared to these! I love how wet these are and never realized how great they were until I tried another brand.	&&&
I really love how it simple the smell is great and IT WORKS	&&&
These wipes are easy to use. Just pull one out. I can take them anywhere I go and use them.	&&&
I don't mind that these are not in packs and thank goodness the large 3 bags in there are resealable. My issues are this....................they are SUPER wet. Like enough to wear I feel like I need to squeeze excess liquid out of them before using. Secondly, they do not separate easily if you put these in a small box in the diaper bag. Yet if you put them in a refillable tub they come apart too easily and don't pop through the hole so you're constantly sticking your fingers in the box to dig for the next wipe. I got two cases of these since they were on sale and I can't wait till we are done with them. I think the main issue is just that they are super wet which causes the heaviness and why they come apart too easy in a tub. We have to let the baby air dry a bit before putting a new diaper on and it takes forever since these wipes are so wet. We normally use Target store brand wipes and will be going back to those once we finish the last case of these Huggies ones.	&&&
So good we had to buy 2! Easy and convenient to use. Buy one now, click the button. The product does have a tiny crack that goes around for the opening where you stick wipes in. It has been two weeks no problems with wipes drying out. Basically it doesn't close all the way tight.	&&&
Does a wonderful job at removing ALL makeup and it's not drying at all. Refreshing and quick. Another great Boots product I like and much better than the Neutrogena wipes. A great purchase!!!	&&&
"Love Pampers wipes. Very handy that they have the snap cover on each package so you can travel with them and not need a wipes box."	&&&
I've always used clorox product because it cleans better then any other brand. A family used product.	&&&
Great product, nothing but the best with each Clorox item purchased.	&&&
These are OK--I am scent sensitive and after reading some of these reviews I was worried how it would smell. They don't smell great, but at least it is not too strong. Sort of a herbal vanilla citrus. I find the wipes very soapy, to the point of almost needing something dry to wipe off the residue. After using, hands felt moist (aloe looks like a main ingredient) and did not have any negative skin reaction.	&&&
I use the wipes in every room of my house. It leaves a clean feeling and smells amazing.	&&&
I luv these wipes super easy always have them on hand	&&&
Great disinfecting product and easy to use, especially with kids in the house!	&&&
THis product is very awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee	&&&
The Staples Screen Cleaning Wipes are excellent for my computer, printer glass, cell phone screen, home land line phone screens, television sets,and eyeglasses. The compact dispenser is much handier than the flat pack Windex wipes we have used in the past.."}},	&&&
These are my go-to wipes for my cloh-diaper wearing baby. They hands-down work better than the disposable Pamper Sensitive wipes we have used in the past. Just add water and you have wipes that will last you for age! I'm now up to 3 sets of these for our stash. Highly recommended!	&&&
I love these wipes. They smell so good and they are so refreshing. Just read the label and don't use on your eyes. I use them more for when I wake up to refresh my skin than to remove my makeup since you can't use them around your eyes. All around great product and I will buy again!	&&&
I love Clorox disinfecting wipes! Especially now that I have a two year old running around!	&&&
I enjoy the wipes because they are quick and easy and effective	&&&
I've used Clorox for years as did my Mother. It's still the same great cleaner.	&&&
I use clorox wipes in all areas of my house. They are easy and quick to use when you have little ones and school agers in the house!	&&&
I can't live without these! Use them throughout the day in the kitchen and in the bathroom for quick clean ups. Easy and affordable - great value!	&&&
We disinfect tables and desks used for meetings and colloquia about 1x/wk. Clorox Wipes scrub the gunk (body oils, food remnants, dust, dirt from being in an open-air building) from the surfaces with the bumpy side of the cloths. The tables and desks also smell wonderful; that's why we buy the lemon scent.	&&&
Our family loves these wipes... Even better when they are on sale!"}},	&&&
I have a container of wipes in every room of my house.. They are great for disinfecting with pets, children, and everyday messes.	&&&
I use these all the time.They are great.I good value at the price.	&&&
Pampers Sensitive wipes are great. I usually buy them for the diaper bag, as they are a bit thicker than the others and so last longer. Great for sensitive bottoms!	&&&
Great product easy to use, only wish they were more eco friendly for the environment or I would use them all the time	&&&
I like this product because it helps me with cleaning.	&&&
Kelli from LV NV Love how they clean so well and conveneint	&&&
It was difficult to get the first sheet out and then once out the sheet was small, just big enough to get your hand onto, but not as big as the disinfectant wipes. Otherwise seemed to clean the monitor and TV OK"}}];	&&&
These are great! A little pricey but they make the cleaning so convenient! At home I wash and then sterilize, however, at work these are perfect! I don't like having to go into the bathroom to clean my breast pump and it's accessories so these wipes make it so much easier!	&&&
These are great at home and with it being flu season, they are even better for school!	&&&
With two little dogs, I have a lot of little messes. And with Clorox, I know I can handle anything that my babies can throw at me.	&&&
These are the same wipes my Vet prescribes for any topical infection my dog may have. Perfect for my bulldogs wrinkles. Half the price as what I pay at the Vet.	&&&
The best part of these nice-smelling, lemony cleaning wipes? They don't streak!	&&&
I've always been a loyal user of Clorox. I prefer to use this brand (for laundry & cleaning) because i believe that it cleans and disinfects better than any other brands. I will never ever trade Clorox for other brands! :)	&&&
I really like the smell and believe in its unique cleaning and disinfectant quality.	&&&
These wipes work just as well as any other, and cost less than name brands do. It doesn't tear up my kid's skin, or have any heavy fragrance or chemical scents. Very satisfied with these wipes.	&&&
Ive tried several different brands of wipes. These wipes are the perfect combination between softness and wetness.	&&&
When you have little kids, you HAVE to have Clorox wipes handy to disinfect everything, especially when everybody is sick at home during winter time!	&&&
"I live in South West Florida. With that being said, I maintain an amazing tan from Spring to Fall. Once the temperatures start to drop in the winter months my color fades as I tend to cover up more.
There is just something about a tan body that makes every women feel 10 times better about herself. I wanted to maintain my color all year. After all, no one wants to be pale and pasty.

So I went ahead and did some research for self tanners, believe me... I have had my fair share of experimenting with store bought tanners. I wanted something that wouldn't leave me looking like I had just come out of the orange grove. As most self tanners leave you looking VERY orange. Ewww. I came across the Thermalabs self tanning wipes. I thought to my self, tanning wipes? I have never heard of such a thing before. After reading and seeing the results of people that have purchased them already. I just HAD to try them.

Boy oh boy am I glad I did. You see, you don't see immediate results as the color comes gradually through out the day. As instructed I showered with my exfoliated body scrub and scrubbed my elbows, knees and ankle area. I towel dried off and applied immediately. It took about 3 wipes to cover my entire body. (Which I thought was great, I could get several applications with what came in the box.) I used the rubber gloves that were recommended but shortly after applying I took them off as I felt it wasn't applying properly. The wipes are similar to that of a baby wipe. The smell and feel of my skin after the first application was amazing.

By the end of the day, I noticed a difference all over. I am super impressed with the self tanning wipes. I will NEVER purchase a self tanning lotion or spray AGAIN. The color is very even, and natural and more importantly it doesn't leave my skin orange. Definitely give these wipes a go round. I'm serious. You will not be disappointed!
What an AMAZING product, AMAZING results and an AMAZING company."	&&&
I could not live without Clorox products. I have kids and they are a must!	&&&
I have been using these wipes for about 6 years now. With two toddlers and a puppy, these are a must in my house. They clean with ease and disinfect any areas they may be in contact with. Also, they are excellent in cleaning up spills in carpet so it doesn't set. I have white carpet so it is vital to get up any stains quickly and these do almost as good as my deep cleaner.	&&&
Such a good price on wipes, however the wipes are pretty thin.	&&&
Clorox wipes are a great, convenient way to keep my house clean	&&&
These wipes leave such a good clean smell after wiping my kids and I love the texture grip between the two I know these wipes get the job done.	&&&
Good stuff I like being clean and i like wiping stuff.	&&&
Easy to use for kids and family and disinfects everything wonderfully. Love these wipes.	&&&
These are super soft and quick to dry, which is important for my baby's easily rashy skin. My only complaint is that they are so soft and silky it takes more wipes per change than regular more textured wipes. Still, good buy for a sensitive bum.	&&&
I've tried 2 other wipes from the major toilet paper brands and these are the only ones I like. These aren't overly scented, they hold their shape, and most importantly they don't have a lot of irritating chemicals that dry out my skin. They're very comfortable to use.	&&&
If you're looking for a soft wipe that is gentle on the skin and has no added perfumes, then you've made a good choice. However, for those thick pasty toddler doo doos this may not get the job done well. These wipes are thin and it takes several to clean a large mess. I'd recommend these wipes for young infants, but they are not a good choice for older babies and toddlers.	&&&
These wipes are a cross between kleenex and diaper wipes, meant for wiping little noses. They're very gentle, softer than diaper wipes but just as moist. They are packaged conveniently, easy to pull out of the package, and the top snaps securely to keep them from drying out. My son hates having his nose wiped but these make the task much easier.	&&&
Very convenient for on the go disinfecting! Great product! Highly recommend.	&&&
Love this product. I have used it for years. I've tried using paper towels with soap when I'm desperate, and it just doesn't cut it. That leaves soap residue and can't remove stains or food as well off surfaces.	&&&
Great! I really like having these around the house!	&&&
These wipes are just okay. They're thicker than other brands, so while it seems like you're getting fewer wipes in a box, you don't have to use as many to clean your baby's little messes. They do leave a sticky, filmy residue on my baby's skin. It doesn't seem to bother him, but I can tell a difference in the way his skin feels after using Huggies wipes versus using a different brand. His skin has never reacted badly to the wipes, like with a rash, but mine has. After wiping him, I get tiny red blotches on my hands from using these. That being said, I'd still say they're alright to try. They don't cause my friends' hands to break out, so maybe it's just me. My baby is perfectly happy with them.	&&&
greatest invention ever...can sanitize without the spray. great for quick cleanup. good for wiping off knobs and handles during cold and flu season	&&&
LOVE this product... so convenient for cleaning. I use them all over the house.	&&&
I don't have sensitive skin but have had different wipes burn my eyes. These feel really great when you use them and after. I enjoy the smell of them as well. I love all aveeno products! body wash, face moisturizers, shaving cream...	&&&
These wipes are life changing. If you have any issues at all with keeping clean or if you have hemorrhoids or other issues, this is a must. Even if you don't have any of these problems, it just feels good to be extra clean. These wipes are soft and luxurious with just the right amount of moisture. Then just flush when you're finished!	&&&
Clorox helps keep my House clean and free of bacteria.	&&&
All clorox products are my go to supplies due to there product guarantee. I would rate this and all clorox products 10 out of 10 its the only product that kills germs and clean.	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use and they disinfect too.	&&&
I cannot live without these wipes. I always have extra on hand. At work or home I always have a need for them.	&&&
"Pro:
Very good wipes. Thick & soft. Cheaper.

Con:
One star off because it contains a lot less moisture than other wipes I have used, like Pampers & Huggies.
Adding more moisture will make it much easier to wipe the poo."	&&&
I absolutely love your products. I love the way it cleans.	&&&
This wipe warmer does the job but is frustrating. I love the 2 warming settings, and the night light function is the best I've seen. However, the hole to pull the wipes out is too small. The spring loaded platform holds the wipes close to the warming plate but makes it hard to pull the wipes out. Finally, it says it works with major brands but we use Huggies and it isn't long enough (left to right) on the inside by a fraction of an inch.	&&&
I love my Clorox wipes. I keep them everywhere. They are used to clean up spills in the kitchen,bathroom, car. They spell great. I use them all the time and think that they are great	&&&
I love, love Clorox wipes, every scent smells great. I love clorox bleach and also the multi purpose sprays, which also smell amazing and clean.	&&&
These wipes are the best - my baby has never had a diaper rash since using these.	&&&
Love all of Clorox products. It's the only thing I really trust for that deep down clean. It's flu season and I find Clorox wipes to be very convenient and I know that it's killing germs. Thank you for making such high quality products CLOROX	&&&
Clorox Wipes make it easy and quick to clean. I am so pushed for time, that I really value products that save me time, are a good value, and get the job done. Good product!	&&&
I use clorox wipes in every room of my house. It is an essential cleaning item.	&&&
Thick, cushy, soft and well made; these are my favorite wipes! Better than Bummies flannel wipes. It's a no brainer to get cloth wipes if you're cloth diapering!	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes and they are the only brand I will use. I wish I had began using them when my son was a newborn, I didn't discover them until he was about a year old. I used to go between Pampers and Huggies wipes and I would use 6-10 per dirty diaper. With my Seventh Generation wipes I use 2-4 depending upon how messy the diaper is. The wipes are thick and strong and able to clean so much better. I also love that the ingredients are safer for my little one and they are gentle on his sensitive skin. I cannot sing enough praises for Seventh Generation and their wipes!!	&&&
This is such a great cleaner for many purposes. It smells wonderful and is valuable to my cleaning routine.	&&&
The baby wipe warmer is ok at best. It knocks the chill off the wipes but the warmth is gone before it gets to babies bottom! It's still better than ice cold wipes!:)	&&&
"I buy these wipes for a wipe board that the kids use in my kitchen to write notes, draw pictures, make list or leave reminders. We have an eraser for the dry erase markers but after time it looks really blah, so we use these wipes and it cleans it right up just like new AND Staples is the only place that I can find them!"	&&&
I will recommend this product to a friend o will recommend this to everyone	&&&
i love the product use it on everything in my home! smells great	&&&
I love the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. Cleans absolutely EVERYTHING!	&&&
Love to use in mostly in the bathroom or kitchen, but great to use anywhere!! Especially love the scrubbing ones!	&&&
I Love using Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for our household. especially being a mom of two boys which make toliet cleaning really easy.	&&&
My 3 y/o son will only use these to wipe his nose. They smell good and help to keep my son's nose from chafing. I prefer the smell of the grape wipes to the regular wipes.	&&&
great wipes, comes with container to store wipes in and refills	&&&
I love pampers sensitive wipes! I don't have to worry about running out because I get a shipment every month.	&&&
They're so soft and thick. I use it for baby wipes and I cut them in half. It's perfect! Definitely a good price for quantity also!	&&&
"This tripack is a good value compared to buying these separately. As someone who wants surfaces free of germs I go through many wipes at home and in the office. They are easy to use and are very durable. It is nice that they come in different scents as well. I have cleaned my entire kitchen with one wipe!"	&&&
Great way to get your kids helping around the house	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes! They're so easy and convenient to use.	&&&
I love them they are so easy and convinient to use to clean everything from kitchen to toys to bathroom.	&&&
I use clorox disinfecting wipes every day. They are quick and easy to use for a fast clean up. I know that with one swipe, the spots are getting clean while disinfected. Love these products!	&&&
"It was difficult to get the first sheet out and then once out the sheet was small, just big enough to get your hand onto, but not as big as the disinfectant wipes. Otherwise seemed to clean the monitor and TV OK"	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox Wipes. I would be lost in this world if I didn't have them! I absolutely hate touching gross things, and Clorox Wipes give me a solution so i can still clean without having to touch gross, germy things. I keep them handy all the time time, as I have three young children, and I have to keep the germs away! Plus it keeps the house smelling fresh when I use them. Thank you for creating such a great and convenient product to fit my needs!	&&&
"I love this product because it keeps the wipes warm, and it is good when contact with my baby."	&&&
Use them everywhere in the house! Wouldn't change brands!	&&&
terrific product. love that is a easy to use disincentive.	&&&
I have super sensitive skin and the Ultra-calming description sounded like a perfect fit for me. Too bad they added a frangrance which not only irritates my skin, it bothers my sinuses too.	&&&
I travel a lot and I like these because they never dry out. The packaging keeps them moist and they are easy to pack in a bag.	&&&
HUGE fan of Huggie's wipes! They are so thick compared to other brands. My son is no longer in diapers, and you can still find a travel set of these in my car, bathroom and the kitchen for various reasons! Definitely the way to go when it comes to wipes!"	&&&
These wipes are a must for anyone with sensitive skin! I use them nightly to remove make-up, including mascara. They are very gentle on the skin and do not irritate my eyes or face at all. My face feels so refreshed and clean afterwards. The best part about these wipes is that there is absolutely no need to rinse with water when you are done using them. The only down side is that I wish either the wipe itself was bigger in size or the package contained more wipes!	&&&
These are the best wet wipes out there. Trust me- I've been tempted and have bought the cheaper store brand wet wipes to try and save money, but I end up using 4-5 to the 1 I use of these. Do your little ones tushy a favor and use these wipes!	&&&
I like these better vs other brands I have tried. Other wipes I have tried are too thick and stiff. The Pampers wipes are thick enough, while being more flexible to get under folds, etc	&&&
Great value for the money. Really don't see much of a difference from Huggies or Pampers.	&&&
Gentle on the most tender skin of a baby. Easy to use.	&&&
Love Vernon. It calms my skin as well as removes all my make up. They are large enough that 1 wipe does your entire face	&&&
I love this refill pack. It allows you to stock up but keep the wipes nice and fresh. I keep wipes all over the house so I love the convenient individual packs of refills. Wipes are bomb!!!	&&&
These are less thick than the One and Done wipes. Of all the wipes we've had with my 1.5 year old these are my favorite. Now that we're having another I'm definitely registering for these.	&&&
This package is an excellent value and my only complaint is it's difficult to pull out only one wipe. I have also purchased the individually wrapped wipes for travel. I would have given this 5-stars if it was easier to get only one wipe at a time.	&&&
I am a huge fan of Pampers wipes. We use wipes for everything. We keep wipes i both diaper bags, 2 places at home, and at grandmas. This big box is the perfect size to refill all the places in one purchase. They are smooth and don't have any harsh smells. They clean well and are pretty durable. Have never caused a allergic reaction or rash like some other brands. I love that I was able to save up my no rush shipping credits for this purchase. Will definitely be buying this size box a lot more.	&&&
I learned about these from a friend who brought me a pack as a care package when my son was first born. I love them! They are so soft, have just the right amount of moisture and they smell great. I personally like the grape scent the best. I use these on musket to blow my nose sometimes but they are fabulous for my son's nose when he stays getting boogery.	&&&
Nice wipes. They do tear easy and the sent isn't as strong as other brands	&&&
my elderly lady loves them	&&&
This work great for our custodian's to clean off door handles and desks. We have been fortunate this year not to have a large outbreak of the flu and we think it is because of our extra cleaning procedures using these wipes."}},	&&&
I will never buy any other wipe... These are the best hands down.	&&&
These are the best wipes out there! Our daughter has very sensitive skin and since using these wipes she has not had diaper rash and they work great! I will say I do agree with other reviewers and the containers could be better so that we could just pull one wipe at a time because oftentimes you do get multiple wipes.	&&&
love it. especially with little ones around. disinfects well around my home.	&&&
I would use anything other then Clorox and be worry free about germs. Clorox is the only way I go.	&&&
I absolutely love using Clorox Products! Convenient, smells good and gets the job done. Always gets my bathroom looking and smelling great.	&&&
I tried these wipes because they are cheaper than Pampers wipes and even though I am VERY particular about my baby products, I wanted to give it a try because price wise I save a little each month. These wipes are AMAZING. Quality is great, smell is great (for sensitve non-scent wipes), and the price is great. Since having my daughter my husband and I have found a use for wipes everywhere in the house....these will stay on my subscribe and save each month :-)	&&&
I love the wipes, I use them in every room! They are easy to use and clean great!	&&&
These wipes cover all the bases. Very moist, large, durable, cost effective, and there is a lot in the package. I also really liked the Amazon Elements diapers but doesn't seem Amazon is selling those anymore. Hopefully they will bring them back. Over all I am very pleased with these wipes and have not regretted making the switch.	&&&
These wipes are just okay. They're thicker than other brands, so while it seems like you're getting fewer wipes in a box, you don't have to use as many to clean your baby's little messes. They do leave a sticky, filmy residue on my baby's skin. It doesn't seem to bother him, but I can tell a difference in the way his skin feels after using Huggies wipes versus using a different brand. His skin has never reacted badly to the wipes, like with a rash, but min e has. After wiping him, I get tiny red blotches on my hands from using these. That being said, I'd still say they're alright to try. They don't cause my friends' hands to break out, so maybe it's just me. My baby is perfectly happy with them.	&&&
I love that they are ready to use... just pop one out and clean away.	&&&
I love these wipes for disinfecting my kitchen sink. They work great and make me feel good about keeping my kitchen germ free	&&&
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT....its so easy and smells great. Use them every day in my house x	&&&
I have used Clorox products since they were first introduced. I love the Bleach spray in a bottle, it's a little strong smelling so do not use in tight spaces. It will get pen/marker off any surface except walls. I love my Clorox individual wipes, especially the new ones that have a rough backside to help me scrub. Anything that needs wiping down I grab one or two and away I go. I scrub floors, counter tops, ovens, refrigerator, kids plastic toys; if it has a hard surface you will find me whipping out my Clorox wipes. I love the lemon smell and it is a great value for the money! I wold recommend any of Clorox's products to someone without a doubt.I guarantee you if you came to my house you will see and smell all the products I use!	&&&
I LOVE Clorox Wipes! Totally Addicted. If any surface looks the least bit gross I just grab a wipe and clean it, which leads to cleaning the entire area because the wipes last a long time! With Clorox in them I know its clean and disinfected!	&&&
I use these daily in my kitchen. Love the lemon smell.	&&&
I love and appreciate Clorox Wipes for the simple fact that I have 3 kids two being little boys that can seem to get into every little thing. The wipes are convenient for all the little finger prints on everything and they disinfect. Any Clorox product is amazing but I love the wipes!!!!	&&&
99.9% of germs killed on contact, Clorox is the only brand trusted on my home.	&&&
I use these wipes both at home and in my classroom. My students use these every week to prevent the spreading of germs. An added bonus is that the room smells clean and fresh after using them.	&&&
I used it for everything clean,decinfect,deodorize,ang good quality	&&&
These are excellent wipes. I have tried almost every wipe on the market and hands down these are the best. They have a very nice textured pattern which makes for easy cleaning. They do not smell or leave a residue.	&&&
I was grocery shopping at Kroger and saw a sale for 2 Natural care wipes for $4.00 and they were in very pretty containers. It did not have huggies on the sides, one had flowers, the other soft dots and just made a cute box for the house! Ever since then I get the refills at Wal-Mart and they were on sale there as well. It had the movie ad for Frozen on the bag!	&&&
I live in a place with many roomates. There are always fights over who made what mess. These wipes make it easy to clean spills as they come. Love them!	&&&
Clorox products have been the best disinfectant product that i have ever used. it is convenient and doesn't smell too strong that is unbearable.	&&&
I find these wipes actually tear when I am wiping and a cheaper brand I had previously used did not do this. These do however feel much nicer and more moist than cheaper wipes.	&&&
I've tried several other makeup remover wipes, and this one is hands down, the best.	&&&
Works great at cleaning laptop screen no smudge	&&&
Great wipes, I love that when we put them in the tub they don't stick together. My daughter has never had a rash while using these wipes	&&&
Came in a box, exactly as expected	&&&
I received a free sample of these wipes to try out. These are durable enough to clean EBF Poop & still gentle enough to use on my babies faces. I won't buy anything else now, I was skeptical at first because sometimes "green" products aren't as durable as regular wipes (ie huggies, pampers) thats not the case with these.	&&&
This is great for kids with sensitive skin	&&&
"They don't come out automatically in a wipe container, so you have to reach in and grab them. Will not be my preferred wipe for this reason."	&&&
While these are not all natural as I think they should be, they are WAY BETTER than the Babyganics and conventional wipes. Clean up the formula, make them all natural, and give us more value, then I will give 5 stars.	&&&
Keeps the wipes wet, thought it would be slimmer, but overall a good wipes container	&&&
I bought them because I hated using regular makeup wipes to take off any lip product, mainly because I couldn't stand the taste. I think they are a great product, and I really love the brand and everything they represent. The only things that I don't like, is it isn't worth it to but the little package, if you're going to get them order the 30 pack. Also, I don't know if there was a tear in one of the packets or if it was a freak thing, but a couple of mine were dried out already when I went to use them. But, 10/10 would buy again and recommend.	&&&
I have a puppy and she makes a mess, these are convenient	&&&
Same as most other wipes but one thing I did notice is the bad smell these things have.I will not be ordering again	&&&
I have children. Disinfecting is necessary. I use these daily. Also they are very good at cleaning out the stain that is left behind from cat vomit. And the best, quick way to clean up after my husband cooks.	&&&
I highly recommend these wipes! we use them on our new baby and they have been great.	&&&
Don't like the seal the wipes are in when you want to close it, its just a clear tape you re apply to close. Wish I would have known wouldn't have bought.	&&&
Easy to use for all kitchen jobs especially counters.	&&&
What a waste of money!!! Don't buy this product. Indeed it is true--MoRE than a third of the wipes are DRY as wood!!	&&&
whenever I take my twin boys to a store bathroom, I clean the toilet first with Clorox wipes.	&&&
I love these make-up remover wipes. They do a great job removing all make-up including messy eye make-up. I really do look forward to the nightly face-cleaning ritual. No more dirty washcloths. Just one wipe cleans off all make-up every time. They included a smaller pack for traveling. Another great idea.	&&&
I've not only use these for both my kids when they were babies but I've taken these wipes on camping trips, fishing, hiking, & backpacking. I've also taken them to the zoo, fun parks, & carnivals, since nothing cleans cotton candy off everything like Huggies Wipes do, lol. I've taken them everywhere and they are the best wipes out there in my opinion.	&&&
I use these wipes daily, I have 3 boys that aren't much for keeping a bathroom smelling clean. I use these wipes for a quick wipe down on the toilet seat, floor and counters! They smell good, and disinfect wonderfully with ease and convenience.	&&&
These are the perfect wipes, they have a nice thickness, soft, and have a lot of moisture to them, I won't use any other wipes!!	&&&
I agree with others, they've changed these wipes a bit. They have a weird smell to them, almost... sour? I haven't noticed a rash on my little one yet but the smell is very off putting. Plus I don't feel like they're quite as moist (I hate that word) as they used to be. AND the the opening in the package where you pull the wipes out is very thin and ALWAYS rips when taking the first wipe out, make it hard to pull out only one after that. They still clean my kid's butt. But a little bothersome.	&&&
"""for the flu season and all year keep things clean and disinfected easy to use wipes in hand container



great price!"""	&&&
"I am a first time mom with a 7 week old baby. She tends to spit her pacifier out at the most inopertune times. It will hit the floor in a store or a restaurant. But having the pacifier wipes around, I simply wipe the paci off and give it right back without worrying about where it has been."	&&&
I just don't know how I ever lived without these amazing little helpers! I use these every day.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes always have them on hand for quick clean ups!	&&&
It's awesome! I love everything about the wipes! The entire line!!!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes!! They are a great value and really get the cleaning job done.	&&&
"We've been using it from our 1st daugher (now 3 y/o) and for brandnew baby 4 month as well and we love it. soft touch and no perfume. This is what we wanted. We found it at the hospital when 1st daughter was born, it was good and no perfume and asked a nurse if it's a commercial use special coz at that time there's no label then she answered it's Huggies natural care. We've been using it since then.

One point, bottom side of wipes in the bag is dripping wet and wipes on the upper side of the bag is quite dry. You can solve this issue leaving the bag upside down for a few hours before using it."	&&&
They really clean dirty messes and I love the fact that I can just clean and toss! Very convenient!!	&&&
These wipes smell good and they dont tear easily. The wipe almost feels like real material. I would buy again for sure.	&&&
My grandmother used it. It's the best on the market and always will be! Stay great!!	&&&
"I love this wipes very soft and gentle for babies when they have a runny nose."	&&&
Purchased to create dry wipes for newborn. They have a strange chemical odor to them. Will be using them to clean the floor instead.	&&&
i love having clorox wipes around the house because they are an easy way to clean up messes and disinfect any type of household item. great for bathrooms and kitchens as well as cleaning childrens toys.	&&&
I always go to clorox products before any other products. I just believe in the products.	&&&
I depend on the convenience and efficiency of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes every day! With our family's busy schedule, it's a comfort to know a reliable cleaning partner is fingertips away!	&&&
"the wipes get the job done, cleans pretty well.
the package is nicely sealed after opening and the wipes stay very wet. the texture of the wipes are a bit rough, and it leaves my skin a sort of burning sensation that i really don't like."	&&&
Great product. Clorox is the only wipes we use to keep our home clean. With 4 kids, we need the best.	&&&
Great wipes, I love that when we put them in the tub they don't stick together. My son has never had a rash while using these wipes.	&&&
These wipes left my skin feeling dry and irritated ! Didnt like them at all. Also it did not do well on removing all of my makeup.	&&&
I really like these wipes, they smell nice and leave behind a clean smell even after the dirty mess that a baby can make lol	&&&
My family LoveS them!!! Big mess no problems with these... Super easy and quick to clean after my bunch!!!	&&&
I have used clorox products over 20 years and they have always met my needs.	&&&
It's amazing , clean very well and is very simple to use I love	&&&
we used all the time and with everything. Kitchen, bathroom	&&&
I love clorox products. The bleach is the best! I also love the Clorox wipes. Very easy and does a great job.	&&&
These are hands-down the BEST make up remover wipes I have ever used. Though I don't think they are ophthalmic rated, I experience no irritation when removing my eye makeup at night like I had with the Almay product. I use the wipes on my entire face and find them neither drying nor oily. They're great!	&&&
love Clorox whips for all my every day clean ups,so conveinent	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfectant Wipes because it is a great sanitizer for wiping the toilet seats.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. I keep a container not only at home, but also in my office at work. The wipes work great on getting spills off my desk and grime off countertops/stovetop at home. I also use the wipes on the bathroom counters and my coffee table.	&&&
These are by far the best wipes that I have ever used on my dog. They are a nice size and don't have the strong smells that my dog doesn't like. And you can't beat the price. I will keep buying them.	&&&
I love that there are only 2 ingredients in these wipes. I use cloth wipes on my baby, but sometimes need a little something more and these are great!	&&&
We keep a canister of Clorox Wipes in the cabinet under each bathroom sink and under the kitchen sink. That way, whenever there is a spill or mess, it gets cleaned up immediately. It's a product we have used for years and can't live without! The canister is convenient, but Clorox makes it a product we can trust.	&&&
I love using the wipes as they are so easy and convenient. They are also great to send to school with my child for her teachers to use to clean the classrooms.	&&&
We don't have human babies, but we do have a mitred conure and a black bird. These wipes are perfect for cleaning up after messy birds, AND our papillons. They are perfect for camping and using to freshen up. We don't get caught without a spare case in the house!	&&&
"As a nurse, I know the use of saline is commonplace in almost all wound care. In fact, in many-if not most all surgeries, saline is the irrigation used for it's antibacterial qualities.
THIS IS A BIGGIE WITH ME-and one of the many reasons I love this product.
On another note,
I wouldn't write what I am going to say next if you knew me, because it would be bragging in a way...but since you don't know me, I can honestly say I have a very young looking face-very fair skin-and rarely use make-up (I am in my mid-40's, and am post-menopausal). I have worked hard at keeping my skin pure looking...and one of my keys is NEVER EVER touching my face with my hands unless I have washed my hands well.

With that said, These ""BOOGIE WIPES"" are a miracle 'wipe'....The ingredients not only have saline--[and that antibacterial quality is TOPS on my list]...
BUT what makes these even better is that added to these is VITAMIN E and ALOE...other mainstays for my facial care.
I will forevermore use these as my ""wet wipe"" of choice not only for my face (for the 'in between' washing times), but keep them in my purse at all times for hand wipes, use in public bathrooms, and basically wiping off anything I sit on, eat off of, etc.

I also am keeping a pack in my bathroom for feminine hygiene and basic freshen up moments when in a hurry.
Great to even clean your ears with...

I can only imagine they are wonderful for babies and children....
I haven't tried the grape-but am sure they are another plus when needing to use them with children. (I will say though, the 'fresh scent' is mild and truly appealing).

I cannot emphasize as a professional and a consumer, what an amazing combination is found in these wipes....and is a true 'find' with the purpose to use for the original intent of wiping runny noses that need those ""crusties"" and tender spots addressed.
I am taking this time to write this lengthy review because I never want these to go out of production....so BUY, BUY, BUY!!!!

I wish stores like TARGET or WALMART, etc. would keep these with the facial care products...as you will need to go to the baby section to find them. They could actually be placed in several department of any store as these.

At TARGET, one pack was about $4...
However, I was able to find 3 packs-of 30 wipes each for about $10 online.

I strongly recommend these...keep a pack in your car for sticky fingers, in your purse, in your bathroom....even with your cleaning products!
I often wipe off a door handle or my cell with them when I am done...
Safe....ANTIBACTERIAL, and soothing (VITAMIN E and ALOE).
PLUS, with all the ""bugs"" we are facing today, you could never go wrong.

Another thought as well...they would be a great replacement for antiseptic gels....for in my opinion, those gels are so harsh, they dry your skin, causing cracks which just strip you as one of your first lines of defense...being unbroken skin... (Even a paper cut can turn into an infection).

Also, because these are wipes, versus a gel, they can be used to wipe underneath your fingernails."	&&&
Wipes clean very well.feeling is fresh. Very soft. would recommend this product	&&&
The wipes come apart when I try to pull them out. They don't clean well at all, and you have to follow up with a dry cloth to avoid streaks. The spray is so much better. I wouldn't purchase these wipes again.	&&&
The price per sheet is very good and the wipes are effective. However, the wipes are packed in several large sealed plastic bags and each package of wipes is too large to fit into the dispenser that is included. Less convenient than the Kirkland brand.	&&&
I love how this wipe handles even the toughest messes! Can't recommend enough!	&&&
I really like Clorox it cleans better than any other products	&&&
I love these so much I can just put one in my purse and I can just freshen up when. I need to its affordable and the wipes are flushable so that's a deal	&&&
Love these wipes! Easy to use and leaves a nice scent. I am confident that these help kill nasty germs. Would reccomend them to everyone!	&&&
My 9-year-old cleans the bathrooms in thw house because of this product! He wipes around the rim and sinks with the sheets, and conveniently throws them away and washes his hands. Thank you!	&&&
I love these wipes! They really clean well with minimum wiping. They don't have a scent and are very soft.	&&&
I cloth diapered with my first baby, but have struggled to keep up with the laundry this time around so have been looking for low chemical wipes and diapers to use. It would be nice if you could find low chemical products at the local store, but that has proved to be nearly impossible! I found these wipes on Amazon and decided to give them a try. I have to say I wasn't too impressed on first use- the wipes had a weird smell (to MY nose) when I first took one out of the package and they aren't sudsy like some wipes (though I don't expect this with the chemical free wipes since the sudsing agents are some of the chemicals I'd like to keep out!) so you need to wipe a little more vigorously than you might otherwise. But all in all they do the job well, the price is right, and I feel good about what is in them. I then ran out of the wipes and was using my homemade wipes/solution until we had a trip to go on and I needed some disposables again. Target actually carries these wipes (!) (sometimes) so I headed out to Target to grab a few packs. They only had one pack left on the shelf, but they had a lot of Honest wipes. I had heard that Honest company products were supposed to be pretty low on the chemicals so I decided to try a few packs of Honest wipes and diapers since they were out of Water wipes. BIG MISTAKE! My baby broke out in the most horrible, bleeding diaper rash within a week of using the Honest wipes and diapers. I've never seen a diaper rash like this, it was heartbreaking and I immediately switched back to my Nature Babycare diapers and Water Wipes. Instantly the rash went away. Use these Water Wipes if you're looking for a great, natural product. Highly recommend and you can get them at Target in a pinch.	&&&
i like the smell of Clorox. I use it to clean everything from the kitchen, to the bathroom, and my fridge.	&&&
My son is sensitive to wipes and I was having trouble finding some that he didn't break out from and out of all the ones we tried huggies were the best and he doesn't cry no more when it is changing time.	&&&
When cleaning laundry or counter tops, I always reach for clorox. It gets all jobs around the house done and leaves everything smelling clean.	&&&
"Really great everywere i go, easy to use and practical.
Great sent."	&&&
I like to use the wipes to clean the toilet seats on a daily basis.	&&&
number 1 brand I will defenetlyy recommend to every one	&&&
"These wipes are moist so they wont irritate the skin, perfect for constant booger wiping! I actually use them to blow my nose too now :-) The container is great, in just one push you can grab a wipe before boogers end up in babies mouth or couch. I will always buy these for me and the baby. Grape is my favorite scent!"	&&&
"I love Clorox because I know it will kill all germs that are in my home.
I also love Clorox bleach because it brightens all over whites, it cleans my house very well!
Keep up the great work!"	&&&
Let me start off by saying, I love the Huggies Brand. It's really quite great, every product of theirs I've used so far for my baby has worked amazingly beyond my expectations and my soon to be husbands' too. Being able to have this large bag of wipes on hand is awesome! We have to on-the-go reusable wipe bag that you can snap on to handles in your car, and the reusable wipe box that I can stick in any room of our house, and this large bag of wipes can fill them both for mon ths at a time. Which is really nice because we a messy little boy. They even work well with his sensitive skin, it's like a big bag of heaven...well if heaven had baby wipes everywhere to keep everything clean.	&&&
Really like these newer "Citrus" Wet Ones single wipes. Fresh scent with the well known quality of Wet Ones. Great to keep in glove box for those shopping/refueling clean ups. Large sized wipes a plus.	&&&
I prefer Lysol Wipes over Clorox brand wipes.	&&&
I only received fifty wipes and this teeny tiny package was labeled as 500. I think not! So ridiculous that I have to deal with this now. Not to mention my son is out of wipes and now I have a lousy fifty wipes to hold me over.	&&&
Recently my cat got sick shortly after breakfast. It's something all pet owners deal with and most have the tools ready to clean up the resulting mess. Upon hearing the 'furball is coming' sound I immediately went for the clorox wipes and paper towels. They took care of the mess and the lemon scent controlled the odor. No need to deal with laundry. Just toss in the trash and you can go about your day. Whatever did we do before having something so simple yet effective? I highly recommend them--in any scent.	&&&
Other name brand wipes have an ingredient that Charmins doesn't, therefore doesn't irritate them. Awesome product! Would totally recommend and will always purchase again	&&&
I keep these in my gym bag. They are great for cleaning up before or after a workout. I hate having makeup sweating down my face. These make up wipes are individually wrapped and fit nicely into any bag.	&&&
Normally I use cream silver polish. Used one on a sterling silver plate that has many small cut outs in it. One wipe didnot do a through job. I plan to use the rest on jewelry. Was disappointed the wipes didnot do better.	&&&
Clorox is a great cleaning product especially with young children in the house.	&&&
I usually buy the by the biggest box available. This purchase was for the diaper bag. These wipes are thicker, smell great, don't make my baby break out in a rash. He is very sensitive and has chronic diarrhea these wipes don't make him cry out during diaper changes. I can clean up a huge blowout in 2 wipes. They are fantastic.	&&&
"When my daughter was born, the hospital sent us a few dry wipes to use. When I ran out I went on a fruitless search for them in traditional stores discovered these disposable wipes.
Two years later, we still use them for so mamy good reasons:
-Sturdy, incredibly soft and reusable (can handle many laundry washes)
-cleaning child's face & dishes for mealtime
-homeade disinfectant hand wipes (just cut into squares)
-gentle & nourishing jojoba & eucalyptus-infused wet wipes for wicked colds/runny noises

I hope they never ever run out!"	&&&
This is a great product. It is a bit pricy for this bargain hunter but otherwise it is a great product.	&&&
Super easy to use! Knowing it's Clorox, I know it'll clean!	&&&
I love this product!! It works amazing for daily cleaning and household jobs. I would highly recommend to anyone who has children or pets.	&&&
Was not impressed the wipes were very thick and very dry.	&&&
Out of all the make-up wipes I like this one the best. It has less fragrance and seems to work best without feeling greasy after.	&&&
These keep my counters really nice and clean! I feel like they get all the germs and propel bugs from crawling across my counter like ants!	&&&
"these work.
space saver in the cleaning cabinet
nice scent"	&&&
I clean rental units to get them ready to show. Clorox products are affective and pleasant smelling at work & in my home. Thank you.	&&&
The screen cleaning wipes are effective and work well. I like the decorative pop-up container that looks pretty sitting on my desk. They are always at hand when I need them."}},	&&&
I keep Clorox Disinfection Wipes on my toilet and they are quick to use with little kid messes in the bathroom.	&&&
Great flushable butt wipes. Never leave home without them. Your butt will never again fear the horrible toilet paper at hotels, airports, the port authority, gas stations, and taco bell. My butt has never been happier!	&&&
Clorox wipes are a great product. I use them on a daily basis for cleaning.	&&&
These are the best wipes and they are nice and big too.	&&&
I've tried a bunch of wipes to see which I liked best as I would be using a lot of them with twins. Pampers sensitives are my favorite!	&&&
love Clorox wipes they are so easy to use and they work wonderfully	&&&
BIG CONTAINER GOOD	&&&
Love the Clorox wipes with no scent & cant hardly find them anywhere but I love them, think Clorox everything is great!!	&&&
I like everything to be clean and Clorox does the job!	&&&
Love Clorox products cleans and disinfects very well	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes! They are easy to use and always easily accessible. It's so much simpler to grab a wipe to disinfect the counters, toilet, floor... than to spray a bottle and wipe it down with a rag. it's also so convenient. It's also nice to know that when I grab a Clorox wipe that my surface will be clean and, well... ready for the next spill!	&&&
I've used Clorox wipes for a long time know and use them often. I love the convenience of them. They clean up after big or little messes effectively and with ease. I would recommend these products to anyone!	&&&
I use these for daily clean up of all our bathrooms which get quite messy with two kids. Easy, quick, effective.	&&&
We haven't had any diaper rash since we've used these wipes. I wish more stores had them- so I could try to find coupons- they are expensive though.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! They smell wonderful and leave my son's tushy fresh & clean! They are thick and extra wet for those extra messy jobs. Yet they are gentle enough for wiping baby food smiles and sticky fingers. I guess this scent only comes in the Frozen character tubs. I've never seen it regular anywhere. I hope it doesn't disappear once Frozen gets old! I don't want to buy any other brand or scent. Also, I got this box at a great value of just over $11 with Subscribe and Save!	&&&
Clorox is synonymous with clean. i trust that it disinfects well to keep my family safer.	&&&
These wipes are better than any others we've tried.	&&&
We use these daily, we love these and always make sure we never run out	&&&
Love it! A great thing for me to keep in my car to keep it clean.	&&&
Fabulous!!! Love ALL Clorox's products. Work wonders!	&&&
"Clorox Wipes are my 'go to' cleaner; from kitchen counter tops to EVERYTHING in the bathrooms.
I sanitize doorknobs, light switches, faucet knobs, toilet handles-you name it-I sanitize it.
If my Clorox Wipes are not on sale I just about have a breakdown!
I use them EVERYDAY!
I gave my church the Clorox wipes to use in our building.
I let everyone know about them.
I also have my boss buy them so I can sanitize everything at work.
Everything named above to the common pens our patients use to do their intake.
I could just go on and on and on!
Thanks for the greatest product EVER!!!"	&&&
keep these in my purse and in the cabinet by my chair. they are very handy for right when you need one. you don't have to look for a public bathroom just to wipe your hands.	&&&
Great product, easy and convenient to use. Would recommend to anyone	&&&
With 5 kids---these wipes are a MUST in our household!!	&&&
I love these. I keep a bottle in every bathroom and in the kitchen!	&&&
I've been using these for quick/easy cleanups, they're perfect for that.	&&&
These are amazing! I assumed I would be able to find these in the local Walgreens or CVS but I have only been able to find them here! they work great at getting off those sticky bandage marks left behind on your skin.	&&&
Too much thin and sticky. I would not recommend this to anybody. Prefer Pampers instead of this. Very Cheap quality.	&&&
We use these for everything. They are excellent for traveling and camping and we keep them in every car and every room of our house. Quick clean up.	&&&
Pampers wipes are awesome! The smell is very fresh and the quality of the wipes makes for perfect dirty diaper clean-ups. It doesn't take many to get the job done thoroughly! The wipes are also gentle enough to use on my baby's face and hands.	&&&
"This basically is a box with a weight in it. The weight has a hole to pull the wipes through. It's great for those middle of the night dirty diaper changes. I think it'd be better valued at $15, but I still give it a good review. It has rubber feet to keep it in place and a clicking clasp to keep the lid closed so your wipes don't dry out. It keeps the wipes more moist than the plastic box they come in from the store."	&&&
"I purchased these wipes to use downstairs and wipes from the Honest Company to use upstairs when changing my little one. After using both, I like these well enough, but prefer the Honest Company Wipes.

The pros for Huggies - No fragrance detected, it does a nice job cleaning, and the seal is great at keeping the package closed, making this a great product for on the go (diaper bag, car, gym bag, etc).

Cons - I've noticed sometimes the wipe rips when trying to pull it out of the package.

Overall a good product, and well priced."	&&&
These wipes are soft and gentle. They are great at cleaning baby's bottom. I'll continue to buy these wipes.	&&&
My son has terrible eczema and these wipes truly are sensitive! They have not made any skin breakdown or given any rashes. They are really awesome.	&&&
These are far and away the best wipes I have ever used (and I have used many brands). One wipe really does do the job of removing make-up. They are great for removing everything when you need to do a make-up quick change. I have also used them on late nights when I want to head to bed in a hurry. They are non-irritating on my normal-to-oily skin and do not leave the face dry and tight.	&&&
Use these wet wipes from birth to my daughter, very happy with the quality: very soft, with a pleasant smell, do not cause irritation. Thank you!	&&&
These wipes clean well and are the perfect thickness. While these wipes dont make my daughter's sensitive skin break out I can't stand the overwhelming scent.	&&&
"I just recently started looking for greener options in my life and I am so glad to have come across these wipes. My little one is 21 months old and potty training. I love how thick and soft these wipes are. I know that they are not going to tear on my while cleaning my little one which is great. We also use them on hands and feet when we go places like gymnastics and they are durable and just wet enough to clean up the mess. I have also found their price to be very comparable to more questionable options as coupons are always available.

Another plus it she big square flip top lid - it works so much better than the tiny slits in other brands. I can pull out one entire wipe instead of a torn partial sheet.

I highly recommend these wipes, they are gentle, green and very durable."	&&&
I bought another brand and the wipes were all connected, kinda like toilet paper and you had to tear the wipe off. THAT DOESN'T WORK WELL WITH LITTLE KIDS!!! These ones they pull and ONE comes out. Also if they forget to close the box the inside plastic keeps the wipes wet. With the other brand you opened the plastic all the way to put it in the box, kid opens box and leaves it, wipes dry out.	&&&
I use this with my homemade fleece wipes, and it is really great. The weight is a very clever idea, as is the opening mechanism which is easy to operate with one hand. I wouldn't say this was an essential purchase - any sealable box does the job just fine - but it is stylish and perfectly suited to its function. No complaints at all.	&&&
These are a lifesaver when the soothe is dropped in the house when she throws it! Lol. I just need more til I ween her from the soothe :) I also use them for her teething toys and other toys.	&&&
A lot for the cost and they come in handy around the house as well. Plenty in here for the year really.	&&&
Best alternative if you don't want to use wipes with all the harsh chemicals. These are large enough and can be cut into 2 pieces.	&&&
Like it a lot, but not the fragrance. Cleans well.. Good value.	&&&
My little girl gets the typical,"kennel cough", ya know, the runny nose thing from daycare? These are great for keeping her nose wiped without irritating her. I heard the grape ones smell nice but we buy the unscented to cut down on chemical usage.	&&&
"I love these wipes. Yes there are cheaper ways to clean up a mess. But when I leave a canister of these on the counter, my kids are much better at cleaning up after themselves. Because they are so easy to us no on hesitates to grab one and clean up.

The scent is lovely. It does not linger terribly long but makes it pleasant to use. The size is perfect for a quick wipe. I can wipe all the doors and light switches quickly with one wipe. These are especially great in the barn when sanitizing can be a little tough.

Despite the fact that these are made by Clorox, they are not bleach wipes. If you need something that will kill C Diff or really tough bugs, you may need something else."	&&&
compared with huggies wipes I find the pampers to be smaller and thicker. plus there's something about the smell that boarders on too sweet.	&&&
I like the natural care the best because it's not so soapy as the other one's. They are great for just a quick diaper change.	&&&
Before shower of cleansing face removes makeup.	&&&
"I use these after night time pumps to avoid getting up to wash all the parts... It
Makes pumping a little less exhausting!"	&&&
"This isn't just for babies, but great for adults too. This definitely is a great alternative to buying Playtex Personal Wipes. They stay nice and warm (just as good as heating them in the microwave in my opinion, but not so hot that it burns). I keep this on my nightstand next to our bed and bought a pack of mini sized white microfiber wash clothes that I found at Dollar Tree for only $1. Save your money and go to Dollar Tree. Trust me they work just as well and are very soft. I have found that the microfiber clothes stay warm better than the disposable ones we bought, and is wonderful and handy to have around for intimacy or any clean up afterward. We have not had any problems or issues with them turning brown or moldy. My husband loves them too and he always says, ""ahhh this feels good"" every time he puts one on himself. lol. I am considering getting another one to keep in our bathroom as well.

I wish the company would consider making a lubricant warmer as well. I suppose one could put a plastic bottle of lubricant in it directly, but I have personally not tried it in fear that it might melt the plastic. :/"	&&&
great product for newborns very nice and smooth. great for any age but I recommend it for new moms out there. This product is great for baby's	&&&
I had rosacea pretty bad. My skin was blotchy and I had flare ups often and I have sensitive skin as well. This product (along with a change in diet) cleared it right up. My skin looks even and glowing and I get many compliments on how good it looks. Also, I do not wear foundation. If anyone has rosacea and is having a hard time finding a moisturizer give this a try!	&&&
Love Pampers wipes but prefer the sensitive that are not scented. Didn't seem to irritate the baby though which is a plus but still prefer the sensitive since they aren't scented.	&&&
"I keep a container of these on the counter near the sink. It encourages people to grab one and wipe down the mess they make in the kitchen. It's much easier then getting out a spray cleaner and paper towel.
Just make sure to always keep the lid closed and they will not dry out even to the very last one."	&&&
This brand works great just like the other brand's but you don't paid so much !	&&&
The only reason I am not giving this product an A, which could just be myself personally, but my issue with this product is after I used it, I literally felt like I was on fire down there. Maybe it is because I have sensitive skin, but ouch. Other than that, great for freshening up and feeling clean, and easy to carry around in my purse.	&&&
Love the product, price increased.	&&&
These are great for a quick cleanup of messes around the house. I use them in every room in the house and also take them camping to easily clean up our camp table. They cut through grease easily for kitchen messes and leave bathroom counters sparkling and smelling great. I wouldn't substitute them for a regular deep clean, for those in-between times you can't beat it. Works great when you have unexpected company and need to quickly wipe down your kitchen and bathroom.	&&&
They are good wipes but i could not stand the strong scent	&&&
These wipes are my favorite. Soft and hold up to get the job done. I enjoy the sensitive for my sons and they have never had any issue with them.	&&&
Item received in good condition	&&&
I use Clorox every day for many differant things including Kitchen,bathroom cleaning book ,purses, handrails,any other things.	&&&
Great product. Freshens my home and sterilizes my counter tops.	&&&
Great smell and instant clean. Loved the smell, not typical "Lemon Fresh" but just a clean fresh smell. I will purchase this Ocean Fresh Sent again, especially the amount of wipes per container!"}},	&&&
So thankful that I found this product"boogie wipes" with my two son they easily catch colds especially this winter season and have no problem for a dry sore nose in every colds they have.	&&&
Love the lemony smell of the wipes. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who like the lemon smell.	&&&
I love using the Clorox wipes.... they are so convenient and easy to use!	&&&
its very easy to use because I have a year old son who loves to grabbing and touching everything.	&&&
"Great product especially for a baby that refuses their nose wiped or suctioned. Great to have in your purse as well if you have allergies. Highly recommend this to all"	&&&
I hesitated buying this product because of the fear of toilet stoppage. No problem whatsoever. The wipe cleanses nicely. The only suggestion I could make is to enlarge product. Buy it. You won't be sorry.	&&&
I love Clorox smell when I use the wipes in my kitchen or bath. I know it's clean and disinfected. Thank you for years of confidence in a good product.	&&&
Love these wipes. My son is allergic to most wipes and diapers and these are the only wipes I can use that don't break him out.	&&&
This is another great product from Clorox. It is so convenient and wonderful for disinfecting and deodorizing just about any room in my home. I always use them during and after I cook raw meat. These just help to keep my house clean and germ free.	&&&
Love these wipes. Use them for every day cleaning and quick wipe ups! Have a container in every room of my house!	&&&
These are the only wipes I'll use. They don't have an irritating fragrance smell like other wipes and they are just the right amount of thickness.	&&&
"""These wipes are so convenient when you're at home or on the go. They're thick enough to be effective but thin enough that they're easy to use around little noses and hands. I love the fact that there's no fragrance and just simple saline. They can also double as toilet wipes and they work like a charm when you have sticky hands but no access to soap and water.

i love that fact that they are so easy to use... It's also nice smelling and not harsh... Great for wiping up countertops and anything really... So much easier that having spray bottle and towels	&&&
I love these wipes. I use them for my countertops, tables and cabinets. They smell great.	&&&
I love it does a really good job and it don't have a bad smell like most products.	&&&
I used to us generic wipes, or huggies, but my baby's bottom was always red. I hate huggies wipes because they are rough and really thick, they almost feel like a paper towel. I received a sample of papers wipes in a case and I fell on love. They are so soft! I noticed in less then 1 day of using them that my baby's bottom wasnt nearly as irritated, and the redness was going away. I took back all my other wipes and exchanged them for pampers. And if they had a choice for 10 stars on the scent I'd give it to them. They are so clean and fresh smelling with no perfumes. I absolutely love these wipes!	&&&
I love these wipes and use them daily to get rid of germs especially right now that the stomach bug is going around.	&&&
I use these all the time to help disinfect my house and help keep it clean for my family.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes because it cleans everything and so easy to use.	&&&
Love using these wipes. Cleans and disinfects and it easy to use	&&&
These are the only wipes she skin can handle. Love these!	&&&
These wipes are so soft and gentle. They clean really well. But they do have a stronger scent than I prefer.	&&&
Love these wipes, cleans and disinfects in a jiffy.	&&&
I love using the Clorox disinfecting wipes. They are convenient and quick. They smell good too!	&&&
leaves my counter feeling fresh and clean! love them	&&&
I love clorox wipes. They are very convenient and easy to use.	&&&
Pampers wipes are just the right thickness They are soft and clean well. Like the scent	&&&
Tablets are smaller than expected, but open up to full size wipes. The fact they are bio-degradable makes them even better. Love them. Very easy to carry several in my purse and backpacking. Have used a few now, and given some out to family members. Everyone loves them as much as I do. Bought these to stock up and be sure to never run out, and am buying more for emergency supplies. Highly recommend these to anyone! Would give 10 stars if available.	&&&
"This makes getting wipes out so much easier. You truly get just one at a time. Some brands of wipes work better than others as far as pulling out the first part of the next wipe. They are still easier to get than out of a pop top wipes package. I think the price is a little high, but it is what it is. I will probably buy another so we have one on each floor."	&&&
I use these wipes to wipe down all my kitchen counters, vent a hood, cook stove, and everything in my kitchen. They are easy to use I like the smell of lemon as well.	&&&
I love the Clorox Wipes! I use them for all my surface cleaning. Great in kitchen and bath. Very convenient in keeping the grandkid's toys clean and stain free.	&&&
I have no time to spare and tons of messes with dog cat grandkids so Clorox is always with me and very convenient	&&&
These wipes are a litter wetter than I like, but very gentle and good sturdy cloth type texture. Mostly I don't like that because they are all water they don't leave behind a fresh clean scent.	&&&
4 kids need wipes constantly, in car in bedroom at school, even in rooms and bathroom	&&&
Very good products. Disinfects well. Keeps surfaces clean. Lasts long.	&&&
Love the scent of the lemon, use these for everything from kitchen to bathroom to spills on the floors! Love them,	&&&
I love to use Clorox wipes its super convenient. I use them all over the house. and carry the on the go in my babies diaper bag.	&&&
Cerama Bryte cream cooktop cleaner outperforms Weiman brand Heavy Duty cream cleaner hands down. GE recommends CB cream cleaner for our smooth-top "Adora" electric range. Frankly, I've tried both cream cleaners. Cerama Bryte cleans the surface completely and leaves no flakey residue. The Cerema Bryte Touchup wipes are exactly that; light duty between cleanings: quick and easy to use. Good stuff!	&&&
I really like all clorox products for all cleaning uses. With 3 children in the home they com very handy for everyone to use.	&&&
I love clorox wipes the room smells so fresh and clean all the time.	&&&
Love that it is safe to use, but it's very stiff and was very hard on my baby's soft skin. I prefer Honest Wipes.	&&&
This is our favorite wipes. They clean very well and they are very soft. Love them.Great product.	&&&
Your products are great and easy to use. They also give it a nice clean smell.	&&&
I love the ease of disinfecting wipes! I use them to wipe down my daugthers high chair, my counters, my vanities, and everything in between, They have saved a lot of time when I need to pay attention to my children!	&&&
I love Clorox, it helps us from getting sick. And it always makes my home smell nice.	&&&
I like using natural products for my children so this is what we use for disinfectant wipes when we are out and about. They leave your hands a little slimy feeling but as soon as they dry the feeling is gone. They are nice and wet. I have left the container open a few times (accidentally overnight) and they didn't dry out. I like the size of the container, It is small enough to keep in my diaper bag yet big enough to use several times before having to replace it. The wipes are just big enough to wash my hands with, but easily do my daughters.	&&&
They are totally awesome and nice for easy cleanup	&&&
"The lid can be hard to open with one hand, and the wipes have a tendency to tear of you fill it all the way.

The capacity also leaves a little to be desired as well."	&&&
These are the best cleansing wipes. I use them on greasy messes, as well as on spots that need disinfected. The dispenser is super easy to use as well.	&&&
When my son was a newborn he Was very prone to rashes and needed gentle wipes... these were great.	&&&
I love knowing that clorox is killing ALL the germs!	&&&
I like using the wipes since i watch kids in my own home and i like knowing that the wipes are disinfecting as im cleaning so i can have a healthy enviroment for the kids and my own.	&&&
All I can say is I love Clorox wipes they are convenient and wonderful for fast cleanups.	&&&
Works well around the house - pleasant smell that is not overpowering	&&&
This product has made changing time a much more pleasant experience for my little one. The heat distracts him so he doesn't cry during changes. I would suggest this to all of my new mommy friends. The only downside is if the wipes are full you can't pull through the top without ripping the wipes to pieces.	&&&
We decided to go to a wipes budget, and we tried Parents Choice and Huggies brand wipes, but boy did we miss our Earth's Best. They are big and evenly wet, and you can do a whole poopy diaper with one wipe, as opposed to the others that we are trying now. I now realize we were getting what we paid for in these! We used them for 2.5 years and they were a consistent product.	&&&
I love this it helps me a lot haven't had any flairs since I started using these wipes.	&&&
The only reason I am not giving this product an A, which could just be myself personally, but my issue with this product is after I used it, I literally felt like I was on fire down there. Maybe it is because I have sensitive skin, but ouch. Other than that, great for freshening up and feeling clean, and easy to carry around in my purse."	&&&
Thanks	&&&
"I bought these to take makeup off at the end of the day. I wanted a product from a company I knew didn't test on animals, and I figured that if these were gentle enough for babies, they weren't likely to make me break out.

They work...ok. That is to say that they get mostly all of my makeup off, but my waterproof mascara is leaving little smudges under my eyes. They're probably fine for wiping spaghetti sauce off of babies, but I am trying to clean off my blush and eye makeup before I work out and I am underwhelmed."	&&&
These are very soft and do not have too much product which is nice, but they tend to stick together so you use more than you need.	&&&
Amazing!!! Love that it doesn't leave your hands sticky and they smell is good and in normally don't like citrus smells.	&&&
Bought these for my Grand Daughter. They work real nice, price was right.	&&&
great price! our fave wipes.	&&&
The combo pack is better buy because you get a bigger bottle of the spray duster than buying a separate bottle which come in a smaller size can.	&&&
Best wipes and only ones I use for my glasses	&&&
excellent value and smell great	&&&
These wipes are great for quick touch-ups or for overall cleaning. When followed by a soft cloth, they leave the appliances looking like new.	&&&
The sheets rip easy and are too thin. I would recommend the equate version instead.	&&&
The disinfecting wipes are great when you clean. Easy to use, disinfecting power and convenient . It's a must to have when cleaning.	&&&
don't like the new awful smell. you claimed it is unscented, please keep it unscented. I have to make a switch. you are losing me as a customer for your wipes until you figure out another way to be in compliant as well as not producing the bad smell.	&&&
I love these wipes they clean and disenfect my house very well.	&&&
"I use Chlorox Wipes every day to insure that all my counters, bathroom appliances and kitchen surfaces are germ and odor free. They are very handy, pre-moistened and disposable. I always have one in every bathroom and under the kitchen sink. We know that Chlorox is a safe hygienic product but having it in this form, disposable cloths, is an easy way to be sure that you are getting the right amount every time. I always know that everything is really clean when I use them and I use them EVERY day!"	&&&
While these cloths do remove the makeup, they are drier than I expected, so it takes several wipes to get the makeup off. That can be irritating to my skin, so I only use them occasionally.	&&&
"Never use monitor wipes as they dry out fast. Received th box and almost all of them had already lost moisture, were dry already. Useless product"	&&&
Works as described and wipes are just right temp.	&&&
works well and keeps babies happy from cold wipes.	&&&
I don't know if it is because I'm sensitive to strong scents or if I'm sensitive to the main ingredient used in these wipes, but as soon as I opened it, I got a headache. I also noticed the scent wasn't great. But I bought a 6 pack and figured I have to get used to it. In the middle of the afternoon, I cleaned a small half bathroom sink with 1 wipe and the smell was overpowering. My hand felt like it was burning and I washed my hands right away. I proceeded to get dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous, and remained ill for the rest of the day until I went to sleep for the night. And the following days, I could not use that bathroom until the scent was completely aired out. Thank goodness Amazon refunded me for this product as I cannot use it. Ever. I really wanted to like it and was willing to pay extra money since it is more natural than other brands, but it's just not possible for me.	&&&
The price is awesome. I love these wipes.	&&&
I like rhgew convenience. on the go or just in the middle of whatevber. if I cant get to sprays and a washcloth my convenient tub of wipes is there and ready. I just wish trhet you sold refills so that I don't have to keep tossing perfectly great containers!	&&&
clorox wipes are great for cleaning up messes quick!!	&&&
These wipes are extremely convenient and make clean up in the kitchen and bathroom much easier. Saves time and effort.	&&&
"These wipes are ok. I liked that I was able to get so many bags for a cheap price. I won't need to buy wipes for the next month and I got them in Jan. I did receive a refund however, because half of my wipes were very dry. I was desperate not to have to throw away so many wipes and looked up a way to salvage them. Just add a 1/4 cup of distilled water over the wipes while they are in the box and tada! instant fresh, moist wipes. Other than being dry, the only thing I don't care for was how thin they were. I like how plush the Huggies sensitive wipes are, so when there's a blowout I don't get poop on me through the wipe like these did.
Altogether, I may still buy these even after all of this to save money."	&&&
it is the most awesome product in the universe. if you don't use it, you are totally missing out on coolness. I like the movie Ghostbusters.	&&&
I grow up with my mom using Clorox, I could not clean my house with Clorox products as I am very OCD.	&&&
These wipes work great for makeup removal. They get all the makeup off and don't irritate the skin.	&&&
This purchase of wipes was my second so obviously I'm completely satisfied with the product. The price is right and a small amount to pay to get one's hands somewhat clean when no water and soap is available. I use them on travel and at home and try to always have one or two in my purse.	&&&
"The fresh smell makes it hard to believe that it's actually disinfecting, but it is. Great product Clorox, keep up the great work!
I would most likely recommend this product to anyone that has children or pets or just for everyday cleaning."	&&&
use on the kitchen and bathroom counter tops for a great clean	&&&
Excellent product! It is a great product in the way it cleans my home. I enjoy the smell of a clean house.	&&&
Having 4 kids, a dog & now a new puppy. It's an easy fix to anything dirty! Disinfects, cleans well & smells good. Your product speaks for itself!	&&&
These are really great wipes, and the price is great, too!	&&&
Clorox wipes are easy and convenient to use for any busy family!	&&&
This is so helpful to take from room to room, or just to leave downstairs for diaper changes! It holds plenty of diapers, wipes, and a few other necessities/helpful items. I am very pleased!	&&&
I love the product, use is everywhere...the car, work and home.	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox products! Very good product for cleaning and disinfecting	&&&
My kids love to help clean the house and these are the perfect thing for them to use	&&&
Love this product because it smells good and it is thick. with other wipes I would use 6-7 wipes cleaning a BM and with the natural care I cut down to 3-4 wipes.	&&&
these are very useful to clean up and disinfect around the house!	&&&
"I like these Clorox dusting wipes. They're great for tidying the room without using sticky sanitizing wipes. I've used Clorox sanitizing wipes for years, but I have to be careful about which surfaces I use them on because they leave a sticky residue behind. These dusting wipes are great though, because they are dry and don't leave any stickiness behind.

We already have a dusting routine in our house and these wipes probably won't replace our status quo, but they're great for other places like my office and our RV. It's so hard to keep our RV clean, because we don't have the same cleaning routine there that we do at home. I put a box of these in the RV and can grab one and do some cleanup when I have a spare minute. That's so much easier than trying to clean the whole thing when we get home from a trip and we're all pooped out.

Same goes for my office. We have cleaning people come in, but they pretty much just empty the waste bins and vacuum. It's nice to be able to grab one of these and give the room a once-over. These wipes are great for the white boards too.

Dusting really isn't my thing. I think that's exactly why these wipes are so effective. It doesn't really feel like dusting, just wiping down some of the surfaces."	&&&
"The extremely soft fabric make wiping my baby's nose easy. She likes the smell, so she does not fight me when I am having to wipe, and wipe, and wipe, to make sure I've cleared her runny nose!"	&&&
great product, easy to use. disinfects and great price.	&&&
Great product would buy again. I use this product to clean and disinfect my kitchen. I works so well and smells so good.	&&&
Love Clorox. I use Clorox everyday around the house 24/7. Amazing disinfectant. I recommend Clorox	&&&
I hear a lot about mold growing on these wipes but all the times I ever bought these, I have never had that problem. I think you can blame that on the fact that these wipes are stored in various temperatures at warehouses which would cause mold. But as a mother whom has been using these for years, these wipes are excellent! They take off any kind of grease off my kitchen surfaces and dirt off my floors, bathrooms, etc. they have a light smell but nothing annoying like chemicals. I also love that it's plant based and chemical free. Which is probably why they mold easily if not kept at a neutral tempurature. Which should prove how natural this product is. Anything with chemicals in it wouldnt mold up. Definitely recommend if you have little ones.	&&&
love the wipes.....never would use a different brand	&&&
The only wipes I'll use anymore.	&&&
No problems so far with flushing. They are more difficult to get out of the package, than the mainstream brands, but they are easier to get out of the package than Natra Baby Care. They are helpful with our three-year-old for cleaning hands, face, and bottom.	&&&
I will forever use this!! it smells amazing and cleans so well!!	&&&
These wipes are a good product for a great price. They are thick and strong. You get more than you pay for.	&&&
We have used these wipes for years, very soothing and convienant. Tried others but we found they were too thin & useless. Also keeps you clean!	&&&
Love how thick they are and that they come with a way to store the wipes	&&&
If it's to wipe after a wet diaper or to tackle a tough job of number "two", we always count on these sensitive baby wipes to be gentle on our baby.	&&&
Josie, please put these on Auto-Delivery Option for every three months! I love these (plus the polar bears are too darn cute!). Sometimes for really tricky mascara (I put a lot on), I do pump Purity (Philosophy) onto the wipe, but hardly need to. I use these before bed, then Argan Milk, Argan Oil. Wake up, repeat. The wipes are definitely non-drying in regards to not only after they are applied to your face, but also, I found they stay wet and moist in the packaging (even if I forgot to shut it properly). If anyone wants an safe, animal friendly, Non animal testing wipe, they're wonderful.	&&&
These wipes are amazing. They are the best. They wash well and are very absorbant. I use them to help save on tp during menstruation. My best friend uses them for her 3 month old, and washes them right along with her cloth diapers. We both will be ordering again.	&&&
the best wipes ever, i use them on almost everything.	&&&
"I buy these Lysol Dual Action Disinfecting Wipes for our office to clean all of our chairs and equipment with. They are great for a quick disinfecting if a patient has been sick in the office and for everyday cleaning as well. We keep several tubs on hand for our everyday use and we use several a day to cleanup and disinfect all patient areas to make sure we have cleaned up any lingering germs! I definately reccomend these wipes for anyone who has a high traffic house or office to do a quick and efficient cleanup job!!"	&&&
Came in perfect timing. I.Didn't even have to think about it. The wipes are thick and I don't have to use too many for the dirty diapers. Also great with little clean ups	&&&
"These work great on all electronics. I use them on my TV, computer screen and cell phone."	&&&
When my daughter came home from the NICU we were always using Clorox wipes to make sure there were no germs around her. I love that they are easy to use and conveniently packaged. They are my go to wipe for everything!	&&&
Great products. My family use clorox products b/c they work the best.	&&&
These dust wipes are great. We have two cats and a house that seems to generate dust. These are very easy to use; I don't have to reach for anything but the wipe itself. The crowning glory of Clorox Dust Wipes? My son actually asked me if he could keep a box in his room to use on his electronics and his shelves! Booyah!	&&&
I much prefer these individually wrapped wipes as they won't dry out like the dispenser type.	&&&
always use Clorox wipes. disinfects doesn't leave streaks...	&&&
"This was the best smelling self tanner I've ever used! It was only hours later that I briefly encountered that ""dirty"" tanner smell and even then, it was the least offensive of any tanners I've used before.

However, the wipes do not hold much solution. I tried to get by on one and ended up color showing on the first leg I did mainly AND, because it goes on clear (so you can't tell where you last applied) and the flimsy wipe wads up in your hand, I saw streaks!! I tried using two wipes the next time, but it appears I'm going to need to use four or five and I'm around a petite size ten.

The wipes remind me of those little mosquito repellant wipes or those hand towelettes that are wrapped in individual foil packets you get at the wings type restaurants.

And the company called - which is weird - and I didn't answer because it was not a known number to me."	&&&
I keep them I my car for all those unexpected accidents in "Mom's Taxi"	&&&
Love Clorox! Always feel like my house is super clean!	&&&
Best face wipes! Gentle enough for your eyes as well. I have acne prone skin and it doesn't break me out.	&&&
Clorox is amazing product! I use a major part of all their products, because I trust in all!	&&&
Love the convenience of Clorox wipes for cleaning up after 3 messy boys! oops, make that 4 messy boys!	&&&
Did a very good job cleaning up a pasta sauce spill on my countertop. Very little red residue leftover.	&&&
Great deal on a great product!!! SAMs club auctions are great!	&&&
I love these wipes. As with the other Pampers wipes they are strong, soft and gentle.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. They are the best and I have used many. I really like that they disinfect, too. A must-have in my household.	&&&
I love these wipes as well as the fact that I don't have to leave my house to go get them! I can have them shipped for free within a few days of purchase right to my door! Love the pampers brand!	&&&
Perfect and handy caddy to keep on the first floor of our home or anywhere we have baby away from his changer. Nice drawer to store diaper cream, thermometer, bulb syringe etc. Room for full sized wipes container and numerous diapers. This is our second purchase of this item, our first one was pink :)	&&&
Clorox wipes are fantastic and convenient. It's great to just grab them and quickly wipe down those common area surfaces.	&&&
These are perfect. They are soft on one side, and have texture on the other side. They are perfectly moist, not too dry. They aren't scented so don't bother my baby's skin. And you can't beat the price! They also come in 10 packs of 100 wipes each, and all have their own clip top. Perfect. I have one in each room and one in the diaper bag!!	&&&
Great product ....Would recommend to all of my friends	&&&
works great lovvvvvvvvveeeeee. definitley recommend	&&&
We get these from my work all the time as samples and I love them. They are easy and actually help with the congestion. I brought a box to my sons daycare and all the moms were asking where they can buy them.	&&&
I use these all over our house. Bathroom, Kitchen, Kids toys, everything! I love knowing each thing i wipe has been wiped with Clorox!	&&&
I love these wipes - although it takes a little more work to remove mascara and waterproof eyeliner, it doesn't leave an oily residue that other makeup remover wipes does. It makes me feel clean without needing to wash my face after using the cleansing cloth.	&&&
These were on sale so I expected them to be not that great...but they did the job better then some Neutrogena ones I have used. They leave your face a little greasy (as I feel most wipes do) and would not suggest using on the eyes or rubbing too harshly.	&&&
my husband loves cleaning the kitchen with them because its easy. Makes my life easier.	&&&
So easy and convenient, helps sanitize my preschoolers messes quickly.	&&&
I cannot live without these wipes. These wipes make my life much easier.	&&&
Great wipes.	&&&
I have 3 grandsons that can get pretty messy when they are here. I like to have it clean and disinfected for them!	&&&
This is a great product for your newborn. I have worked for hospice for 10+ yrs and we use these wipes on the patients with no problems or irritation to there skin so I gave it a shot on my little one. They are wonderful, high quality, non abrasive, disposable wipe/washcloth for all ages and a must have for moms! The price is also fantastic!	&&&
I love this product and use them several times a day. Removing make-up every night, and prepping my face before make up in the morning. They are also great bathroom wipes, if you know what I mean! Keep this product stocked, at home, and work.	&&&
I know these wipes aren't as durable as some of the other ones out there, but I feel they are much more environmentally friendly. They tear apart, which may seem annoying, but I find helpful when I want to tear it in half to do some other job. The fact that they are more biodegradable means I don't have to freak out when my toddler flushes one down the toilet. And now that I'm potty training I can use it instead of toilet paper and just let it flush.	&&&
These are great at cleaning your skin. I use them to take my make up off, too. Don't get them in or near you're eyes. I use the sensitive kind, as my skin is prone to breaking out and peeling due to over dryness. This product does a great job cleaning but may leave your skin feeling tight and dry. I use ponds moisturizer immediately after using this product and again prior to putting on make up and/or as needed. Great product to use on back/chest if needed.	&&&
Economic item.. the value pack	&&&
These work well on my 9 month old. He makes big messes both inside and outside the diaper and these are my go-to wipes! Fresh scent and great clean-up!!	&&&
I use these along with the bum genius diapers. I'll either wet them first before a diaper change or use a small spray bottle with water and these. They are a good size, soft for lots of wiping especially with BMs and even easier to throw in the wash with the cloth diapers. I highly recommend.	&&&
You can't miss having one of these in the restroom. The ladies are very happy to have access to the wipes and it makes everyone a bit happier. The holder for the dispenser takes little time to setup and once the first wipe is advanced, you are ready to go. The refills make this initial purchase a good one. Replacements are easy to add into the existing dispenser and are cost efficient.Our small office is very pleased."}},	&&&
These wipes made cleaning baby delightful! Great scent!	&&&
We loved this wipes warmer, but it died after only about 9 months use... I am presently trying to figure out if it can be replaced, but if not I will look for a different brand...	&&&
This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.	&&&
I love these, honestly I was skeptical because the other pads I had used were thick pieces of felt. But this removed all my polish in one pad and left my fingers feeling great. They smell fantastic too. Now I keep a set in my purse and at work.	&&&
I love my cup! I haven't used anything else since I bought it and I'm not going back to other methods. I was hesitant at first because I never used one before but it was easy to get the hang of it. The wipes and liquid wash do their job to keep my cup clean and sanitary. All in all it was worth the money I spent on it.	&&&
At my gender reveal party I was given a few containers of Pamper's Baby Fresh Wipes. What I really like about this product - it is hypo-allergic; the texture is very soft and the baby fresh scent smells great.	&&&
When we got these they were already pretty dried out. They didn't work very well on our monitors because of this. We are a woodworking shop and have lots of dust and debris. These wipes did not cut it. Bummer."}},	&&&
My hands down favorite diaper wipes out of all of them! They are worth the extra penny a piece or so!	&&&
Love these, and the scent is imazing. Fresh and clean cucumber baby butt every time :D	&&&
This is the best thing ever. For full time mom with 4 kids these are a lifesaver. From the classroom to the kitchen!	&&&
Great product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	&&&
I use them for every mess I have to clean in my house!	&&&
Love having refill wipes on hand. Huggies come out and don't stick together like other brands do, makes it easier when changing diapers.	&&&
My favorite wipes, nice lid and the wipes don't get lost.	&&&
No strong scent like most wipes!! I am happy to stock up before I have my baby!	&&&
The wipes are ok, but I like the reg. wipes & since my kids have no skin allergies, I see the need to use these. But if there was a skin issue I would use these.	&&&
there are busy little hands running in and out of grammas house, with clorox wipes i can easliy wipe up fingerprints from walls to phones with no problem!!	&&&
"These wipes are great! I bring my tablet to work and others use it, as soon as I get in the car, I wipe it down and it's nice and clean with no fingerprints! They are great to use on everything! I use them on my cell phone, on my computer and my tablet. They are very convenient! I have them in my desk, car and purse. I had to take them off my desk because everyone is obsessed with them and are constantly taking them! I highly recommend them if you want them for a quick wipe down and make your device like new!"	&&&
Wipes are so c easy to use and smell so great. Kids never realize theyre killing germs and making things smell great	&&&
Best wipes. Our son's skin is little sensitive. These are perfect with no fragnance. Non toxic, safe to use even on face. We love them.	&&&
I love pampers wipes I just really don't like the smell. The naturals line they make is my fav.	&&&
I have tried many different brand wipes but these are the best for a baby's sensitive skin. No strong scents also.	&&&
I have used Clorox disinfecting wipes for YEARS AND YEARS. I absolutely love them because they are easy to use, convenient, and I KNOW i get a good clean when i use them, because i am not using the same disgusting rag over and over to clean something. I LOVE clorox products.	&&&
Great for the bathroom and kitchen. I find myself wiping down doorknobs, phones, keypads, knowing I'm a little safer with each swipe..	&&&
I like these a lot, especially for silver & diamonds, but these are a lot smaller wipes then they used to be.	&&&
"These are very gentle to a sick nose. And work very well at getting dried buggers off of the face."	&&&
They're no better than the cottonelle ones. I prefer the 10 pack of the cottonelle since they are much cheaper and have some texture to the towelette. 10 pack seems to be the perfect travel companion (or at work), too. It's basically a marketing exercise.	&&&
Good product and very convenient to have around the house.	&&&
I love using clorox brand cleaning products always makes my bathroom and kitchen smell clean and looks clean. I also use it my utility room to clean my washing machine.	&&&
I love these things i use them on everything in the house to clean up anything. when im done i know the surfaces are clean and sanitized.	&&&
"We really like these wipes. I appreciate that they aren't processed with harsh chemicals. They are a little ""wet"" compared to other wipes, when we first started using them it was a bit of an adjustment, but now I can't use other wipes because they don't feel like they are getting the job done because they are so dry!

We purchase them on subscribe and save so they end up being relatively inexpensive."	&&&
We use Clorox wipes at my work every day when people are sick. It always keeps things disinfected and keeps everyone else from getting sick too!	&&&
Love my Clorox wipes. With three kids, three dogs and 2 cats I am a woman that knows messes and what I need to keep things clean around here. We honestly use just about every product you make and with good reason. It works and it keeps things clean and keeps the family healthy!!	&&&
I send these to my child's school as well as take them to my job. They really work!	&&&
I really enjoy using them. My kid can help me since they are mess free and sanitizing.	&&&
These diaper wipes are ok. I really dislike the pacakaging. Most of them ripped all the way open and I had to put them in a ziploc bag.	&&&
I like to use these wipes for the pacifier, not only for when they fall and get dirty, but to wipe them down every once in while to clean the bacteria that grows from baby's mouth naturally. I feel we all get sick from the dirty things we put into our mouths, so these wipes are great to wipe the pacifier down in between the deeper cleanings. I wish they would sell in larger quantities. I love the packaging the hard plastic lid helps keep the wipes moist. I also like that the wipes do not leave any fuzzy residue after using.	&&&
I love this wipes very soft and gentle for babies when they have a runny nose.	&&&
Amazing product but if you don't use pampers wipes it will disappoint .	&&&
Great product that I use in the kitchen, keeps area clean and disinfected.	&&&
Wipes work just like this should. sensitive work better for my baby since he had a sensitive bum. not too strong of a sent and didn't leave a grimey feeling.	&&&
they work and help with the itching. It is just hard to hold the dog to use them so even though I knew this in advance still tried them	&&&
I gave been buying these wipes from this brand for over 10 years because they never disappoint. The few times I bought another brand they would end up being cheap and a huge disappointment.	&&&
we buy these often	&&&
This product is very easy to use and very convenient	&&&
I use Clorox with everything. This product disinfects while cleaning and giving a great smell. Keep up the good work :-)	&&&
Super soft wipes and smell good! They don't brake my baby out!	&&&
Great price, lots of wipes, good smell	&&&
they don't have enough oil to really clean and they seem dry right after opening the package but they are a good price for less chemicals for your baby	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes...they're easy, convenient, disinfect and smell good.	&&&
Huggies wipes have always been one of my favorites for the kids. Of course my kids are no longer in diapers as they are close to 9 and 7 years old. However I find having them use wipes for number 2 ensures they will get themselves clean. This brand is nice and thick without being overly scented. If you can get a good deal on these then I suggest stocking up because they are worth it.	&&&
I use them daily to wipe down all surfaces during this cold and flu season	&&&
Great gift for women, wipe away those stains after drinking red wine. Only complaint would be the price per wipe, but neat little stocking stuffer.	&&&
I use this as a quick grab cleaning wipe, with toddlers this makes life a great deal easier.	&&&
These are the best wipes that I've tried. They are thick and moist enough to really clean up the mess. They're not only for diaper duty and work well for a variety of tasks like dinner, makeup removal, and general cleaning. These are the only wipes I've tried that don't leave any type of residue after using them. Not once have I thought that they were irritating my child's skin (but to be fair not much does). So now that I've said how great these naturalish wipes are it's time to talk about their case. If you get the clutch and clean it's absolutely marvelous. It keeps the wipes wet for months and you can fit about 40 wipes into one of them. They're reusable and I like that they are because these are a natural type wipe. Essentially it works like a Ziploc bag with an opening for wipes and a strap. The strap has a clasp to attach to pretty much anything, but the strap's fabric seems somewhat cheap. I'd recommend these wipes to anyone and keep them in multiple places because they're so useful.	&&&
"Great for the kids after they use the computer."	&&&
I love the clorox wipes because they are very convenient while killing germs and getting rid of the mess leaving a nice fresh clean scent. I recommend this product for sure.	&&&
I use disinfect wipes at work to wipe down phones, because all front desk people use them, and our area as far as phone, counter, computer keyboard, and mouse is heavily used daily by all agents. While the flu is going around no one seem to care about disinfecting area. So, I take care of this daily on my shift.	&&&
I read the reviews of other similar products and thought this seemed to be the best one considering the reviews were better. However, I was only able to use this 1-2x because even when the top was completely closed (I always double checked) it dried out the wipes inside and I wasn't really able to use them. I just use the resealable Clutch that Babies R Us also sells, or a gallon size Ziploc	&&&
I love this product, however: This was supposed to be a TWIN pack, i.e. come with 2 packs of 25 wipes. Instead I received 1, which is absolutely not worth that price.	&&&
Excellent wipes nice and thick	&&&
They are really good wipes i loved them	&&&
Happy with the product, disappointed with the increase in price from $11.44 to $15.98 in 2 weeks time! That's an increase of nearly 50%!!!!	&&&
"These dust wipes work extremely well at catching and holding dust, but I found that it doesn't always pick up all of the dust on a surface during the first pass. It loses some adhesion after the first pass, so it requires some creative space management to use as much of the wipe as possible to dust a really dirty room. I'd say one would need maybe 2-3 wipes per room max depending on the number of surfaces.

Overall: 4/5 stars, works extremely well but I found it doesn't always pick up all of the dust in the first pass"	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They are easy to use and clean well. I only buy this brand because the smell is not overpowering when I clean.	&&&
So far these are the best wipes I have tried. It is great to have a wipe that does not irritate my baby's skin.	&&&
"""I wish I had these years ago when my older children were little. My one year old screams bloody murder normally when you try to wipe his nose. Not with these wipes. They not only clean his nose

Painlessly they prevent the red chapped nose that normally follow a runny nose. Love, love, love them!!"""	&&&
Soft large wipes that are truly gentle on sensitive skin.	&&&
With 4 women in the house we go through facial wipes quickly. They are comparable to Olay, Just Say Yes, and also Garnier. We use them for waterproof mascara remover, hair dye 'oops' mishaps, cleaning makeup brushes, etc. The snap lid keeps them fresh, but if they do dry out, a bit of water on them refreshes them immediately. The 2 smaller 'purse size' packages included don't have a snap lid on them, making them more prone to drying out. If the tear-tab isn't placed correctly on a dry package, it won't stick. We keep the small ones in a ziplock to help this, but it would be better to have a snap lid on the purse packs.	&&&
Very nice, my grandson has very sensitive skin and diaper area issues. These wipes are just the same as was used on him in NICU after he was born. These are just what he needs.	&&&
I use these Clorox wipes daily during the course of cooking meals. They clean-up really well and I really like the fact that they help to kill the cold & flu viruses. My family and I will continue to use these!	&&&
I like to use the Clorox wipes in the morning around the bathroom sink after I have put on my make up. It makes everything look clean and fresh and takes off any powders from my make up off the sink.	&&&
These Wipes are so Gentle on my babies sensitive skin	&&&
These wipes are fabulous. Love them and when you subscribe an save they are the same price as Walmart store brand but 100 times better. They are thick and I like the packaging with the flip top	&&&
We love these. We use them for cleaning all types of things. I've never seen one cleaning wipe have so many uses. They are wonderful for cleaning grease off of the stovetop, mold on the shower doors, water spots on faucets and more. We don't use them just to disinfect. That's just a nice addition to their use. The wipes don't fall apart and can be "refreshed" with water before you use it up and throw it away. My only complaint is I don't like the smell of the green bottle. I wish you could get them in large packs in just one "flavor". I have purchased other brands (such as the Lysol) but always go back to the Clorox brand. These just seem to clean better than any other wipe.	&&&
Clorox is excellent for cleaning. I highly recommend it!	&&&
The top wipe is always dry. And even the ones that are saturated barely have enough moisture to do more than one couch cushion. These are all but useless. I'm switching to a spray-on/wipe-off cleaner.	&&&
"I love this product! I wish they had it years ago. I have to say i had a good chuckle the 1st time i saw the package!! I discovered this product when looking for something for my grandsons stuffy nose. We started buying them a year & a half ago for him. Since they worked so well for him, we tried them & have been using them for us adults too!! They are great on little noses & old noses too! They are soft & dont irritate noses & are strong enough to blow into. I keep in car, upstairs & down. An awesome product!!! I havent found anything i dont like about it!!"	&&&
its a good prodect. and i really recamend it to other familys.	&&&
"I love Clorox products.
I use them for everything. Feel and smell clean leaves."	&&&
GReat convenient product. I use them often in my home daycare for in between and quick cleanings.	&&&
i use clorox all the time especially clorox clean up , comes in handy with 4 little ones.	&&&
"I gotta say that I am so glad to have come across with these little wipes, they are always needed for wiping down the entire office at times but I also love that it's disinfecting my work area.
And the scents are lovely.""}},"	&&&
i use the clorox laundry bleach tablets for all my laundry	&&&
Very good product. I rate this product as #2, after the Pamper's sensitive wipes. I actually wanted to buy sensitive wipes, but accidentally bought this one. But still this product is far far better than huggies' products. This wipe is little thinner, and little less moist than the pamper's sensitive wipes.	&&&
"Very pleased with these wipes!! I formally used Kirkland wipes because their price was great, but really preferred the nice quilted texture of Honest; while wishing either offered a scented option!! Let's face it, life with little ones can be stinky!
I wasn't sure what to expect based on the ""fresh scent"" description. I would describe it as almost a cucumber-melon scent. Very light & fresh!
The texture & size of the wipes make for quick & thorough cleaning, without using a ton of wipes. We've been averaging 2 wipes per poopy diaper.
Highly recommend switching over to the Amazon wipes."	&&&
Cleans and deordorizes everything that needs to be cleaned and has yet to not meet my expectations	&&&
These wipes help to get rid of strong urine smells around the toilet when your little boy's aim is still not to great!	&&&
Always my first pick when choosing my cleaning products.	&&&
Clorox wipes are a great product & are very convenient to use. It has a very powerful deodorizing effect & gets the job done quickly & efficiently.	&&&
I really like these wipes. They are strong and bigger than expected. I love that they are safe and from a company who does not test on animals.	&&&
Great deal on wipes. I usually only have to use one.	&&&
Similar complaints as others. I developed bumps or pimples on my face after a few uses. And the scent of the wipes was horrible.	&&&
"Clorox wipes are great. They are easy to use. They are great for any mess you have. I have three kids and use them on a regular. I can even use them on my 2 year olds high chair
11"	&&&
I used this product when my son was very young but am now employing it for my own personal hygiene. It's very nice for freshening up during the day. I wouldn't be without it. I know there are versions of this product on the market for adults, but I find baby wipes to be much more cost-effective.	&&&
These are great wipes! They are easy to dispense, smell nice and do not leave lint or stickiness all over when the job is done. Way to go, Amazon!	&&&
It removes stains quick and easy. I don't have to worry about a bunch of different cleaning materials, I can just grab the wipes!	&&&
We've tried just about every brand, and we like Pampers wipes the best. They're soft, moist, and don't irritate our baby's skin. Great quality.	&&&
Very easy to use. I use them all over my house when done just throw away. I would recommend them to friends.	&&&
These are the least expensive wipes I could find, but they are slightly medicinal smelling - though they do seem to work."}}];	&&&
they dry out easily but still love them!	&&&
The best ! I love love loive love love love it. It cleans evrything from bathrooms to kid toys.	&&&
These are nice and large so I can thoroughly clean my face with only one towel. Does a great job without drying out my face. Based on previous reviews, I make sure the package is air-tight when I close it so that the towels stay moist.	&&&
Love Clorox products! Always gets my counters and blathers clean!	&&&
I LOVE Clorox !! I use Clorox products everyday!! They work great!!	&&&
It may have just been me, but I think these should be better labeled that they are the refill packs... purchased thinking they could be used independently but we ended up needing to go to the store to purchase Pampers wipes in the containers to use these with. That being said, they are thin and often tear when trying to pull one out to use. This can be frustrating for middle of the night or crisis-mode changings (when you need to grab a wipe quickly)!	&&&
I love clorox. I would definitely recommend this product.	&&&
Single mother of a very energetic 2 1/2 year little boy. Love using the Clorox wipes after finishing up with dinner for a quick and easy wipe down of the counters so I can get back to playing and entertaining my son :)	&&&
I use everything Clorox,, as my stain remover, the trigger sprays, disinfectant wipes, all the cleaners. I absolutely love them all	&&&
My baby has sensitive skin and these work great! He had redness with other brands but these cause no irritation. Yay!	&&&
I HAVE BEEEN USING CLOREX FOR MANY YEARS IT'S JUST THE BRAND THAT I USE ALWAYS	&&&
The product is terrific, I am pleased by the cleanliness of my lenses when I use the wipes.I keep the packets in my desk, briefcase and cars.	&&&
I used to think these were silly. Why would I need a special wipe for runny noses?? Then my son got his first cold and fought hard against any tissues or wipes that came near his nose. He cried so much and I had to hold his arms down and it would still take forever to wipe his nose. I tried these, and now that he realizes these are different, he doesn't cry or bat my hands away. So thankful that I tried these!	&&&
These are one of my favorite wipes! They smell really good and the travel packs are the best to keep in the car because they don't dry up quickly. I also are like that they are thick enough that they don't fall apart or rip easily.	&&&
Much prefer Huggies wipes to other brands!	&&&
I love the fact that they don't leave streaks when I use them on glass.	&&&
"I used these dry dust wipes to tackle some tough cleaning jobs this week and they really performed well. I would not say that you can clean an ENTIRE room with one dust wipe. However, if you use it judiciously, you should be able to clean quite a bit before you need to dispose of the wipe. They grab a lot of dust on the first swipe, which was pretty impressive. They picked up cat hair easily, but I can't testify to their ability to pick up dust mite matter, dander and other allergens. They're fairly strong and don't tear easily and you can use your fingers to get into crevices and tight spaces. Here are some of the jobs I tackled:

1. Blinds: Impressive results on a set of bedroom blinds. I used these bare handed and pressed down and around each slat. I removed so much dust on each pass that I actually went through about 5 wipes cleaning each set. However, it didn't take long to get good results. There was some flyaway dust and cat hair, but much less than with other dry wipes and the Clorox wipes didn't leave much behind on the wood.

2. Ceiling fans: Again, I used these bare handed and was able to remove all of the dust and even get in and around some of the decorative bits on the fan.

3. Bookshelves: I wiped the shelves and spines of all the books. Will still need to use another dry product to get stray dust off the tops of the books.

4. Toilet: There was a picture of a toilet on the box, so I thought I'd see how these compare to the wet wipes in getting dust off bathroom surfaces. These dust wipes performed much better than their wet counterparts at removing dust with one pass. I'll stick with my other wipes for anti-bacterial cleaning.

5. Furniture: Since furniture is fairly easy to clean, I didn't notice any better result than I get with my regular routine.

In short, these are fantastic for getting into small spaces and hand-cleaning small items such as knick-knacks, picture frames, blinds, and small appliances/electronics."	&&&
I work in a school and Clorox is the only thing I trust to disnfect.	&&&
This product is great for keeping my car and home sanitized. It is my go to product when we have a sick one.	&&&
"These are very nice wipes. Not experiencing any rush with these!

Also it is a nice price for the amount you get!"	&&&
For us, the pampers baby fresh wipes are the best we have tried. We have tried several other brands, but most of them are either too thin or just dont pick up as much gunk. We feel the pampers packs are a good value for their price and our baby has no issues with sensitivity.	&&&
I have used a variety of wipes but none amount to Pampers.	&&&
I am planning a trip abroad and wanted a nice camera that was easy to carry and handle. I am pleased with my new Nikon. Nikon is recognized as a well known brand and that was my main reason for buying plus the price was right.	&&&
These are not too thick and are plush enough that you'll feel pampered using them. I use them on my face and neck and they are soft as silk. They launder beautifully.	&&&
I love Boogie Wipes. They are so soft and dont hurt the little noses even if you have to wipe 100x a day and smell great. My daughter can actully blow her own nose now. This makes life good.	&&&
Good thick wipes	&&&
This is the first time using this brand, i was using something else and I am very happy, they are thick and have a good size.	&&&
"These wipes are very easy to use clean, then throw away.
Cleans excellent. I recommend to everyone"	&&&
Warm wipes are a game changer. Simple to position the pillow. Important to keep it moist or you'll be replacing again and again and again.	&&&
great for cleaning when everyon is sick, like doorhandles ,remotes, and phones!	&&&
I really like the Clorox wipes because they are convenient and easy to get to when I have to clean a big mess.	&&&
Bought these for my 161/2 yr old dog - cleaned him off every time he went out he would walk and sit I. Mud. Un fortunately he passed _ so my daughter got the rest of them	&&&
Who doesn't love Lysol wipes!!! I use these for everything... To clean out my car, to the counter tops in the kitchen, to my kids toys, door knobs. It is awesome.	&&&
These are the only wipes that our family uses and I have always loved them and have never had a problem! I like that they're not too dry like Huggies.	&&&
Very convenient and great product! Just make sure your kids know they aren't baby wipes if you also have a baby :)	&&&
These wipes came within a couple days fm when I ordered them and I put one in the kitchen and one in each of the upstairs bathrooms, I have two. They are great for cleaning!	&&&
I just bought these for the first time. Within the first week, they had stopped up the toilet. I DID NOT flush more than one at a time, as the product states very clearly not to do that. I did, however, use some regular toilet paper at the same time & I think it was just too much. Once I fixed the toilet, I've been flushing them alone & had no problems. I am happy with the size and the durability and they are a good value. Overall, I would buy again but am very careful how I use them.	&&&
These wipes are wonderful when my daughter has a diaper rash. You don't need to worry about any chemicals burning the skin.	&&&
good product and good price	&&&
I use Clorox Wipes to clean my bathroom daily. I love them because it is really convenient to just pull the wipe out, do a quick wipe down then toss in the trash.	&&&
Best smelling wipes ever! We don't even have a baby! I bought a nifty baby wipe warmer that we keep on the nightstand for, you know, clean up. And when we found these and they didn't make us smell like baby butt we bought the whole case. LOVE this scent!	&&&
These wipes are so convenient and easy to use. I use them at least once a day, if not for an actual mess but just so i know my kitchen is sanitary. Also kills any residual food smell, I'm ethnic and I know my neighbors would not be delighted to smell what I make for dinner the whole next day.	&&&
cleans wonderful!! Very handy and convenient. I have one In each room almost in the house. Even have them in our cars. Best cleaning product made to this day. I love it!! It kills germs. So I can keep my family healthy all year long. Even cleans pet's messes also. Just a wonderful product for every household to have.	&&&
Due to the difficult winter, some construction repair jobs had to be completed at the office. There was plaster dust, etc. everywhere and these wipes kept the computers, printers as clean as possible. I would recommend them"}},	&&&
I have been using these wipes since my daughter was born. She is now 2 and I still buy them. They are by far my favorite and the only ones I will buy!	&&&
I have MS and Cancer and set up my house so I can manage efficiently - wipes are the only brand I will use - love them and easy to buy via Amazon and I had coupon. Thank you!	&&&
"It's very practical when travel to park or movies or in the summer"	&&&
These toilettes are moister and softer than the popular brand and have a nice fresh scent. They do not come packaged with a dispenser, but they look fine without them.	&&&
I keep our college-age son well-supplied with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. They are perfect for both bathroom and kitchen use and a 'must have' when four young men are sharing common spaces to keep germs at bay!	&&&
I have purchased many different store brands, this is by far the best. The scent is very mild, product not wet. I would not hesitate to purchase again. Price was awesome	&&&
with a toddler running around with nasty hands on everything, these are great!!!	&&&
Very convenient for on the spot cleaning & disinfecting. I use it every day for my kitchen, stove top, garbage bin & bathroom. I always have 1 container of the wipes under every sink that we have in our house.	&&&
I've been using Pampers Baby Fresh wipes for 4 years. I love them. I buy them in bulk and keep them in various places around the house. I don't have babies anymore but these are great for big kids too.	&&&
cleaned my screen."}},	&&&
Best Product and simple to use fast acting, good for many household chores	&&&
Smell pleasant, not a counter-top eye-sore of a container, do their job. Have not caused any clogs in a low-water toilet.	&&&
This makes getting wipes out so much easier. You truly get just one at a time. Some brands of wipes work better than others as far as pulling out the first part of the next wipe. They are still easier to get than out of a pop top wipes package. I think the price is a little high, but it is what it is. I will probably buy another so we have one on each floor.	&&&
anything by clorox brand i trust i like the fact that I'm disinfecting my home	&&&
Keeps me fresh for those long days	&&&
Clorox products are cost efficient, clean and disinfects all at the same time.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are so convenient and easy to use to clean up spills or disinfecting areas in your kitchen, bathroom or anywhere.	&&&
absolutely love this product.... it does keep the wipes warm... it does not dry them out because of a pad that is kept wet in the bottom of the unit and it works great	&&&
Perfect way to use Simple Green . Amazon is the only place I could find the Wipes, thank you.	&&&
great for quick easy daily cleaning and disinfecting.	&&&
We've used Clorox products in our home for as long as I can remember. I liked the way it smells it reminds me that everything that I've cleaned with it is clean and disinfected. I will always use this product and the convenience of the wipes just adds to it's many uses.	&&&
Excellent product. Works like a charm.	&&&
Clorex clean up is my fav. I use it on my tile floors	&&&
These wipes make it easy for kids to keep bathrooms/kitchen	&&&
I like Clorox wipes because I can clean different surfaces in my kitchen, the wipes all kinds of stains/grease. I love how it freshens my microwave. I use the wipes daily!	&&&
This is a great product. It does a wonderful job of disinfecting ang getting things clean with ease.	&&&
I bought this because I was tired of taking full things of wipes with me, now I can buy the smaller ones and put it in this travel case and made diaper changing simpler..I honestly thought I could use it in a different way but its still make changing my 2 year old on the go easier.	&&&
These disinfecting wipes are great! Easy to use, cleans well & smells good.	&&&
I love the convenience, the ease of use and the compact package.	&&&
Works great for homemade wipes!! I don't fold them, just dampen them and toss them in. My baby screamed at diaper change time until I got this. A great investment especially for winter babies!	&&&
I am somewhat obsessive when it comes to the cleanliness of my home. There is nothing worse than having that "wet dog" smell when I walk into someone's home. This is the perfect "in between bath" wipes. They smell wonderful and quickly get rid of the smell of a dog who has been rolling around in grass all day. I highly recommend.	&&&
I've tried other brands (generic) and they're just not as soft or clean as well as Pampers.	&&&
Even on our baby's sensitive skin these are perfect!	&&&
We have been using these since my daughter was born. They are without a doubt our favorite brand. Super soft, absorbs and wipes well. We have tried a few other brands and this is our favorite by far. We have over 60 of these now and will be buying only these for baby #2! A quality product!	&&&
The only wipes that don't hurt my son when he has a diaper rash. Any other wipe I use when he's sensitive makes him burst out in tears. Can't have that!	&&&
This rather expensive product was no better than any off the shelf anti perspirant. A waste of maney. The little towlettes barely had any moisture to them so I'm not sure they actually had any of the product on them.	&&&
"Received as gift with purchase-- I am in love!! Easily removes foundation, oils and grease and even mascara in a flash.
Doesn't dry out skin which is a huge plus. When I run out I will certainly repurchase!"	&&&
We purchased these and the Charlie Banana organic cotton wipes. I definitely prefer these for messes. Not thin like baby washcloths. Love them!	&&&
I really like this product. Is very soft and has a good scent.	&&&
I like that these have a light scent, not an overpowering perfume smell.	&&&
I buy these by the bulk, love these wipes super durable and hypoallergenic.	&&&
"I have wood laminate flooring throughout and was told to never use anything but vinegar because the residue left by cleaners,well I hate vinegar and to get a decent mop you have to wring it out really good and my wrist and hand would be killing me plus you just pushing dirty water all over!
NOT with the floormate it scrubs and sucks it up nearly dry and the cleaner that came with it works great and a lovely scent.and very easy to maneuver.
I had a couple places that had a dull mark and I looked closer and omg it was old grime I didn't even realize so I went back over it til it came up perfect!
And there is no marks,by moping there would be watermarks and ghost marks from what I cleaned up NO MORE it looks like when it was new!
It says you can vacuum too with it but I have a big lab and long haired cat so I would advise to sweep first because the dirt goes in the dirty water.a small area maybe ok
bottom line buy it you'll like it I sure do!
PS I saw someone had trouble with water left on the floor and I dont know how,there is a trigger that puts water out and you stop pushing it to suck the water up and before I shut off I put it on dry setting.
I might go clean my floors now :) Have a Great Day!"	&&&
I wish I had a BRU closer to me because I would use them all the time. SUPER soft, super gentle. One was all I ever needed for EBF baby's poop. They smell lovely. My sister used them and cleared up her sons horrible rash. I love them!	&&&

Great for those who have children with sensitive skin. However, I prefer Pampers wipes better because I don't have to use an excessive amount to get the job done. These wipes were a little too dry for me.	&&&
i will always buy these wipes. keeps u fresh with every wipe. especially when i'm on the road. these smelll is super great and affordable	&&&
Handy item to use for runny noses or to wipe off the spaghetti coated face. A regular baby wipe doesn't go over well with my child and she prefers Boogie Wipes. A must have in the diaper bag or backpack!	&&&
These are the only wipes that I will ever use. I don't like wipes with scents or that are too thin. These are perfect!	&&&
I absolutely love this product. I always have to have this on hand at all times.	&&&
These are great	&&&
I love these wipes they just dnt work well with diaper wipe warmer	&&&
These work great for my flat faced Himalayan, she has drippy eyes that need to be wiped off daily. The pre-moistened wipes are a gentle solution and they are unscented which is great!	&&&
I use wipes everyday on toilets, sinks, highchair! Love them!	&&&
Great for the kids after they use the computer."}},	&&&
Clorox has made me feel comfortable with knowing that gems are being killed and also knowing that my children can play without getting sick	&&&
These lens wipes work exactly as expected. I probably have a lifetime supply.	&&&
Great Product, Love the product. Not sure what I would do without it. Thanks	&&&
I have been using this product for years and I just love it	&&&
Great alternative for cloth wipes for use at daycare and when we're traveling. It can be tricky to get the wipes out of the bag, so we've started transferring these wipes into an old disperser from a different brand.	&&&
"""We know how babies are and dropping pacifiers is bound to happen.

I like having these wipes so I'm able to clean the pacifiers. Very convenient for me."""	&&&
i use clorox every day. i use cleanup in the kitchen, foamer in the bathroom i love it	&&&
My go to product when my kids are messy or make messes, I would never use any other disinfecting product!	&&&
This product is great for cleaning up the kitchen after my husband leaves a mess!	&&&
They are such a handy way to clean, making it easier for me to clean frequently. I have bought off-brand versions of this product. They do not last as long or clean as well.	&&&
Its the best product for a quick and easy clean. Love using it for everyday purpose.	&&&
love the way it disinfects, smells good, and so easy to use!	&&&
Great handy product........................................................................................................................................................................................................	&&&
I love that with Clorox products I can trust that every surface I use them on will be free of germs. Less worry for this busy mom.	&&&
Very easy to use. Cleans up even the dirtiest messes.	&&&
great products... my mother use clorox since we were kids...	&&&
Easy to use, helps with easy cleaning projects and disinfects! Great when you have kids!	&&&
love using these wipes every few days in my bathrooms	&&&
I love this product when my kids get sick quick into action on the Clorox wipes and within hours already feel the germs are going away with the flu season!!! we live short to no colds in this house!	&&&
I Discovered Clorox wipes Working in a vet office. i was amazed at the cleaning power, the dirt collecting ability and how wonderful they left the room smelling in a VET clinic.. now that's strong! I keep them well stocked at home now. i literally don't go anywhere without them They are in my home, My car My R.V even my diaper bag for public changing stations and restaurant tables etc. Thanks CLOROX!!!!	&&&
These are great. They still look like brand new after using for almost 2 years washing 3+times a week. I can't say that about any other wipes I have. They also have 0 stains!	&&&
"Works as expected."	&&&
We can not live without this product. With 5 kids in the house we always have to clean up.	&&&
Favorite go to makeup wipes on the market. Good value and they stay moist all the way to the last ones in the package, unlike most other brands that are pretty dry by the end.	&&&
i have a very messy 6 year old and these wipes come in so handy! i love that not only do they come in large containers you can get them on the go!	&&&
I love these hand wipes.	&&&
Just bought myself a pack of these the other day. Let me tell you that this is a great product that I would recommend to any guy out there! I'm a believer in dude wipes now	&&&
i am addicted to these wipes! i use them every day! great for bathroond kitchens!	&&&
These wipes are a great value here on Amazon with subscribe and save.	&&&
The wipes are really convenient. They leave a clean scent and disinfect areas that are crucial for me in my house. I love the product!	&&&
I love clorox wipes they never leave me feeling yucky	&&&
bought these for two reasons, 1) price & 2) reviews. I needed an inexpensive replacement for my Huggies One & Done Refreshing baby wipes and bought these in store. Once home i opened the box found 10 individual wrapped packages as stated but what isn't stated is they have their own hardware opening on each package, so no cutting is involved. plus, the hardware is quality unlike name brands where they break with the first opening of package. the thickness of these wipes are plush and cloth like and very soft compared to huggies One & Done which now feel like a paper towel rather than a baby wipe. Also, there is no scent and i mean NO scent. you can put these to your nose and will not smell anything. These wipes are simply amazing and will continue to buy these wipes and buy them as baby shower gifts as these are the best wipes.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting wipes is very convenient for me to clean up a mess and I just have toss in the trash once done. Love LOVE!	&&&
I use alot of clorox products and I love them. They get my white cloths white and they keep my house germ free! I would want to use anything else!!	&&&
I have been using this product for years. I love it. I usually have at least 3 bottles around the house. One for upstairs, one for the kitchen and the third for the addition we built for my handicapped mother. .	&&&
Love it ..not only when we are sick but for everyday use also	&&&
Had a cold for a couple of weeks. It was so nice to be able to use wipes for disinfecting my home. They are easy to use and smell nice too. Luv this product. If you haven't tried it, you must, you won't be disappointed. A must have in my house.	&&&
Loved these wipes! They worked very well & didn't have a perfumey smell.	&&&
great product to use around the house. keeps everything germ free with my family. love to use it and easy to throw away.	&&&
When you need to clean a spill quickly these are the best!	&&&
I love to use this product. They are conveniet and easy to use anywhere.	&&&
"These wipes are thin and too smooth. It takes way too many wipes to get the job done. Plus, their (un)scented scent is unpleasant.

But I LOVE Seventh Generation's other, higher quality, wipes: Thick & Strong, Free & Clear Wipes http://ow.ly/IG9PU. They cost a bit more, but I go through them much more slowly. They have no smell and a great texture that cleans bottoms much faster. I think that the more expensive wipes might end up saving money in the long run. Plus, you will have less poop on you hands, which is always a plus!"	&&&
It's very practical when travel to park or movies or in the summer	&&&
I now have way more disinfecting wipes then i would ever need...and that in wonderful....	&&&
Love my Lemon Scent clorox wipes! Leaves my home smelling fresh and clean. Grab, clean, dispose.	&&&
Never use monitor wipes as they dry out fast. Received th box and almost all of them had already lost moisture, were dry already. Useless product"}},	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! I always have to have a back up canister! I can NEVER run out!	&&&
I love using these wipes on practically everything!!	&&&
I love these things. The work great! But you can run out quick. Maybe it's me but I try not to waste them. I clean my eye glasses then whatever else is near by (iPhone, iPad). Larger items (iPad mini) they don't seem to be or stay moist long enough to do a good job even if it is the first on the list to clean. Great little wipes if you stick to the small stuff.	&&&
This is and will always be my go to brand of all offered products. The wipes, especially, are very convenient and efficient.	&&&
I use these wipes to clean everything. They are very handy and convienent.	&&&
I love it, have one in every room including my car. I can not function with out it. lol	&&&
Love these wipes. I use them in the kitchen and bathroom daily. I have tried generic brands before and they do not compare to Clorox wipes.	&&&
The wipes are very convenient for bathroom cleanup	&&&
"These are the softest washcloths I've ever felt and I own multiple different baby washcloth brands. I could tell right when I felt them that they were made with premium fabric. They are the perfect size, super thick, and don't curl at the ends like other baby washcloths.

The softness alone is enough to make me keep purchasing these but they are also adorable. The way they are packaged is super cute, each cloth is rolled and tied with a whites bow.

My son is drooling all the time right now because he is teething and these work perfect to keep his chin and chunky neck dry. I use them in the bath also and they lather his baby wash super well. I may need to purchase another pack for myself.

I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
I always prefer Pampers and these wipes are great as usual. This particular box is for individual packs that do not reseal but are meant for refilling. I don't mind so much and just toss them into a ziploc. Otherwise, you'll want to buy the reclosable packs instead.	&&&
I LOVE CLOROX! I use it everywhere since I have 2 little ones that make a mess every day.	&&&
love clorox disinfection wipes ( lemon) easy to use and it leaves a fresh scent... i would recommend them to everyone	&&&
Love these wipes. They don't leave a chemical or greasy feeling. The ridges in the wipes help clean up messes. I only use pampers swaddlers for diapers but for wipes I have to use buggies naturals or these simply clean they're so much better than the pampers wipes I've tried.	&&&
Thick wipes and great value! Fast shipping!	&&&
This is my #1 choice for cleaning my counter tops.	&&&
Love it. it disenfects and is friendly for my kids. They even like to use them.	&&&
These are great simple wipes, but they don't remove eye makeup very well.	&&&
Love clorox wipe I can trust on them to do an excellent job on cleaning up messes in the kitchen and bathroom and also disinfecting.	&&&
Love,love these wipes.Been using them on my last 2 kids.Don't care if they don't come apart so easy,I will rather have a more natural wipe than one full of chemicals that comes apart in a split of a second.	&&&
great! i love the product! great to use for kids and pets!	&&&
These are paper thin, just like Pampers wipes. I was not pleased with these at all and will not purchases ever again. If you prefer thin wipes, then these are right up your alley.	&&&
i use clorox for our cleaning of my sinks and cloths	&&&
They are easy to use and i love the powerful cleaning.	&&&
We keep one of these under each bathroom sink fir quick and easy nightly countertop clean-ups!	&&&
I like them because they are good for my house with my new baby.	&&&
quick and easy and I feel like the germs are gone!	&&&
this is a good item. I wouls buy this item over other ones	&&&
They are so easy to use. They aren't hard on my skin like most cleaners. They actually clean unlike their competitors. I love them!!	&&&
The Clorox wipes are one of my favorite products by Clorox because they are super convenient and can be used on anything from the changing tables to the toilet seats to the car seats after my little ones have been there, They are always moist and I can count on them to not only do a great job at removing dirt and grime but also with killing bacteria and helping with any odors. This really matters when you are a single parent with two little ones!	&&&
"I am a mother of 4 kids, and even though 3 are teenagers,
they still can make messes. it is easy and convenient to just grab one wipe stuff down or help clean up messes. plus my kids are into sports and we end up spending a lot of are time at the ball field. which means we end up having to use public restrooms. I like to always have some on me to wipe down toilet seat before my little one uses it."	&&&
This product is simply wonderful. I have been using all the scents of clorox and love the citrus one the most - gives a clean fresh smell to my home	&&&
Very cute and girly flower print wipe case. Perfect size. Keeps wipes moist. Just what I was looking for.	&&&
This is a great product for our use. We have a very busy veterinary practice and use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for all quick clean up in the exam and treatment areas. The citrus scent is our favorite!"}},	&&&
I love Clorox products the whole house smell great and feels cleans including my kids toys garage baskets laundry baskets I use it everywhere I can!	&&&
It makes your kitchen smell fresh and clean when done all you have to do is throw away the whip	&&&
the clorox wipes makes everyday mess clean up like a breeze!	&&&
"Let me just say I am p-a-l-e I love this product Glam2Go Tanning cloths. I am always nervous trying any type of tanning lotions, cloths or sprays. I love having a tan however, most leave you looking streaked or orange tint in tone.

When I received this box of Glam2Go I read the instructions so I would not make mistakes when applying. I couldn't wait to use it. You want to make sure that you shower and use an exfoliating body scrub and also shave your legs. After showing you should make sure your skin is dry before using the towelettes. There is 20 in each box.

You should apply a small amount of lotion or Vaseline to your feet,knees, elbow and in between fingers and knuckles. when you open the package, The tanning wipes do not have any odor and are not dripping but they are wet.your hand so you are using a the wet side.

After you are done applying one coat within 4 hrs you will have color you can apply again at this point if you want deeper color. My results after 3 applications was a nice glowing tan. I didn't have any streaks or orange oompa loompa looking tan.(LOL)

I think you will be amazed by the look of your tan and I highly recommend this product over any other spray tans, lotions, etc that I have ever tried. I received this product in exchange for a honest review and opinions are 100% my own and unbiased."	&&&
love using clorox disinfecting wipes through out my whole house.	&&&
"What a great concept in baby wipes dispensing. Having every single wipe pop up through the opening, is pure genius!"	&&&
Love the clorox wipes! Does the job and kills the germs! Especially around flu season.	&&&
"Purchased the Staples Screen Wipes recently and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a product that will clean their monitor screens as well as any television screens. This is the second time I have purchased this product and will continue to do so in the future. Originally purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend and would not purchase any other. I've tried other products for cleaning my screen but have been very dissatisfied with the results."	&&&
my favorite wipes and they smell good	&&&
Its worth every penny spent on them, not only are they inexpensive but they do a wonderful job cleaning up the baby.	&&&
"Haven't used these much since baby isn't here yet but product is supposed to be safe for her ( unlike Clorox wipes I used to use on everything)."	&&&
These clean the best over any other wipes I have tried. I'm done trying! I buy these every time bc know they work.	&&&
product is super cute and super handy for taking on the go. I love the Disney theme and had to buy it immediately.	&&&
I love pampers wipes. They are fairly affordable and clean well.	&&&
usually I pay no attention to the pop ups about "people who purchased this also bought this" I guess since there was no bombardments I looked and was pleased.	&&&
Great products by Murad for very stubborn acne. I have tried everything out there but this is the only product that works on my sensitive skin. Keep in my car for the hot days that I need that clean feeling	&&&
it is not that shiny after using."}},	&&&
I only rated these as average due to the thinness of the wipes and the fact that you have to use to many to actually get your baby clean.	&&&
Walmart and the internet were the only places I could find these for my little beginner. These are perfect for her. The style, shape, and size fits perfectly. The wrapper is perfectly designed and very cute for her purse and she is very comfortable carrying them in it..........thanks always for helping in the process of making my daughter feel comfortable.	&&&
These are great wipes. They smell ok and they are good at keeping my toddler's bottom, hands, and face clean.	&&&
Love the cleaning power of clorox wipes and they are super convenient.	&&&
Love love love these wipes have two boys and clean up is a breeze! So convenient running behind two young boys and their many messes that they have. It's always a great price and I buy the often.	&&&
Fantastic product! Leaves the room smelling fresh and clean!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes on all tough messes! They help me combat germs .. mom's trusty sidekick! KAPOW!	&&&
Easy to Use! I have 3 kids and they make a mess! Wipes make clean up a breeze	&&&
These are by far the best purchases you can make in these flu and cold months. They help disinfect all common every day items that we use and not realize that are covered in germs. Items like your phone, keyboard, mouse and drawhandles at your office can easily be cleaned. In a household setting there are even more uses for them; from refridgerator and microwave handles to wiping down walls to cleaning up spills, the uses are endless. They also make bathroom clean up a snap. I personally put a container of these Lysol wipes in almost every room of my house."}},	&&&
Use and throw away! No more wet paper towel to touch!	&&&
Love them in the car for after the kids get out of the germy school.	&&&
always use when someone is sick so that NO ONE else gets sick	&&&
I use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for everything! I especially use them during the winter months for fight Flu, colds, etc."}},	&&&
i LOVE Clorox WIPES....BETWEEN MY KIDS AND HUSBAND MESSES THEY MAKE CLEANING SANITARY AND EASY.	&&&
I love this product! I love knowing that my home is fresh and clean!	&&&
Love these wipes! They are my go-to item for a quick clean or even a heavy duty clean up. I dread when I am forced to use a different brand.	&&&
I have found that I need to use multiple cleaning wipes several times a day. Even after using several my lenses are smeared. I confess that I use moisturizers and make up, but it is not like the lenses rub against my skin. The lenses just don't get clean. I find myself using regular windex.... It does a better job.	&&&
I keep clorox wipes in the bathroom to clean the toliet seat,	&&&
I love Clorox for is disinfection power to kill germs, whiten the clothes from all dirt and stains, and the versatility cleaning use from clothes, counters, floors, you name. Excellent product that has been used in my family for as far back as i can remember and for generations to come.	&&&
I ALWAYS FEEL THAT MY FAMILY STAYS A LITTLE BIT HEALTHIER WHEN I USE CLOROX WIPES AROUND THE HOUSE.	&&&
I used to love this product. It never dried my face out and, among all the other makeup remover wipes that do, Costco's never did. That's why I bought it. I felt lucky to have found it. However, they seemed to have changed their formula? Something has changed and it's not my routine. This new formula is so drying. Too much alcohol. Please, Costco, bring back your old formula. You had it right the first time.	&&&
Love this product for it's cleaning and germ killing ability	&&&
The Clorox wipes are so easy to use and convent to keep in the kitchen to disinfect surfaces.	&&&
Best product out there for cleaning and killing germs	&&&
Clorox product help make my Saturday cleaning easy.	&&&
I love to cook in the kitchen and when I finish, I love only having to get a Clorox wipe to insure that anything left behind on the counter is clean and disinfected! Thanks Clorox!	&&&
It has help me out a lot especially with a puppy at home	&&&
Love the products. Very clean smell after use. Cleans very well.	&&&
They are just fine - not enough product on the wipes in my opinion. Plus I don't like being hounded four times from the seller about how much I like these things, and how to use a tanning wipe. It isn't rocket science.	&&&
"I purchased these wipes when I heard that my nephew and his children were very ill with Norovirus. I eventually came down with this nasty disease as well. I made liberal use of these wipes the day I was acutely ill and for 3 days later. Wiped entire bathroom, counter tops, light switches, TV remote, etc. Now it has been a week. I continue to use these wipes in the bathroom and will continue to use these wipes for another week on my eating utensils before they go into the dishwasher. The temperature of household dishwashers is not sufficient to kill Norovirus. Nor do common household wipes, such as Lysol, kill Norovirus. No one else in my household has become sick!!
These wipes do not have any toxic fumes and there is very little odor...just a slught fresh smell. I will be replacing my household wipes in all my bathrooms and kitchen. I will also be carrying a small ziploc with these wipes for grocery stores carts, etc and when I travel. I wish that these wipes came in a smaller travel container."	&&&
"These are the best thing since sliced bread, no chapped little faces, no crying, or struggles to wipe those little noses. Love them and tell everyone. Toys R Us is the only place I can find them."	&&&
Ever since I was a child, my family would always use Huggies Brand. Now I have my own baby and Huggies Brand is all I use, I've tried other brands but the quality is no standard of Huggies. I really love Huggies Wipes inparticular because its thick, gentle, harmless and long lasting. :)	&&&
I love clorox wipes for all my quick countertop cleaning	&&&
Purchased the Staples Screen Wipes recently and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a product that will clean their monitor screens as well as any television screens.

Great for quick or dirty cleanups! So handy to keep in the car for those little things that just happen!	&&&
I use these to keep my toy poodle smelling fresh and clean. These are really great. Poodles tend to have very sensitive skin. She has had no bad reactions to this. I like the fact that the wipes do not leave a sticky residue, they are very gentle and the cloth itself is strong. I only wish they were larger.Using this has her smelling so fresh that people always comment on how great she smells!	&&&
good smelling wipes for hands in individual packaging. I keep them next to my chair for wiping off hands and in the kitchen for quick cleaning of hands after chopping whatever -- onion smell gone.. carry them in my purse for going out in case there is nothing in the bathroom where ever we may be. more and more public bathrooms seem to have less and less available . . . . it may be a cost thing.	&&&
This product cleans well and has great scent! Also has a fantastic price	&&&
I have 2 dogs with sensitive skin issues. These puppy wipes are a great in between bath option with nothing added to irritate their skin. The vet actually recommended baby wipes which I am assuming are also non-toxic.	&&&
"We have been using the Dust-Off Office Share Pack of monitor wipes for several years. The container sits on the counter in our mail room, where everyone can find them and it's easy to access. The wipes work great and they are in individual pouches, so they are never dried out; the ones at the bottom of the container aren't too wet and if you want to keep a couple in the desk drawer, they're quite compact. They truly are unscented, so your cube mates don't know when you've used one. We've tried many types of wipes and these are by far the most popular."	&&&
I use the clorox wipe daily at home and work to keep the germs away. It make my home and work area smell so clean and fresh. I even wash my clored clothing with clorox also help remove the food stain and dirt.	&&&
Least harmful (ingredient wise) we could find out there but we make our own now with dry wipes and our own solution. Much better and far less expensive.	&&&
They're soft, no signs of wear and tear, no loose strings, absorbs well, and just a great material overall.	&&&
2 Connoisseurs Jewelry Wipes 50 Wipes. These work quite well. Pleasantly surprised. of course you need to wash your hands quite well when finished!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because my children can use them and get a great clean without making a big mess.	&&&
I could not remove the wipes from the small opening without tearing them. You have to take the top of the container every time. The wipes leave hazy streaks on the monitor screen. They also do not clean dirt very well. I have used other brands with much more success."}},	&&&
Great! I won't buy regular wipes with all the chemicals ever again!	&&&
Like these a lot. Does the job and three give me one for each area of the house.	&&&
The best cleaining wipes on the market...hands down!	&&&
Almost identical to wipes offered at Chick-fil-a. Prompt shipment.	&&&
The smell of this product was not my favorite but it's cleaning power made up for that.	&&&
"This product is very soft to the touch and gentle on my sons face. It also smells nice which helps keep him from pushing it away like a regular baby wipe."	&&&
Like this product. very convenient. love the scents they smell really great and make me feel excited about cleaning.	&&&
great disinfectant, very easy to use. new smells that are as strong	&&&
Although I am a household cleaner junky, I prefer Clorox brand over any other brand. Clorox is the most trusted brand!	&&&
Pampers wipes are great but didn't realize this box was a combo one, travel wipes, wipes box etc. I just wanted the refill packs.	&&&
These wipes are awesome. They remind me of how the old Bounce dryer sheets used to feel, though not *quite* as thick. They do exactly as advertised! They are dry and dust just sticks to them! I dusted the dashboard of the car, the TV top and screen, the wooden bookshelves, and more with these, some becoming dust-free for the first time in longer than I should mention. Since these are not wet like other Clorox wipes, there's no danger to cleaning electronics on or off. I love these!	&&&
They are great. Clean well and disinfect. Easy to use for grownups and kids.	&&&
"I bought a second one because I loved it so much! I keep this on my vanity because my girls and I use wipes to remove our make-up. With the plastic container we were wasting wipes!"	&&&
I love the ease of use of the clorox wipes. I would wish for a more funky and trendy container.	&&&
Good wipe just not much moisture to the wipe. You may have to use 2 whereas other brands would just take one.	&&&
I love the leaning wipes, they are durable and get the job done! When I use them I know that my surfaces are clean, the smell of clorox means it really clean!	&&&
I love this product. I give it 5 stars. Thanks so much. One of those things that helps make life better.	&&&
I like the ease to use this product. This product is very convenient to use.	&&&
The only time I wouldn't use these was when my son had a rash, I couldnt use scented wipes on the rash but otherwise they are great.	&&&
I was able to try out a 10-pack and it is a great addition to my post-workout routine. I'm always incorporating errands or meetings with friends/clients after a workout and sometimes taking a shower just isn't an option. Cleaning up at the gym can easily be done at a sink, but having that "extra" wipe down afterwards can make all the difference. It easily removes that sweaty residue that is left on your skin and doesn't dry out your skin like soap. It's super small and doesn't take up much space in your gym bag, locker, or car. I've used this product multiple times over the past few years and it's super convenient when you are on the go.	&&&
I love to use this product because its easy to use and i love thr smell of it .. really clean tough stain .	&&&
it is awesome. this is the best wipes for keeping my family safe	&&&
I love how easy it is to clean using clorox wipes.	&&&
Love the handy, individually wrapped wipes. Can keep one handy while on the go. They are not real moist, but do the job.	&&&
Wow! What a difference! These wipes feel gentle and I'm sure my son appreciates the fact that they're easier on his bottom when I'm cleaning him!	&&&
love this product. only one I use and will keep on using.	&&&
Love this product! Don't know what my house would do without Clorox!	&&&
great product, easy and convenient to use for cleaning.	&&&
It doesn't feel clean unless I use Clorox! My family's go-to disinfection perfection.	&&&
"I'm very ambivalent about this product and also whether to give it three stars or four stars. Consider this a 3.5-star rating.

What I like very much about these dust wipes is that they definitely do keep going and going and going. (Sorry, Energizer Bunny.) They clean up black electronics especially well, and the stiffness of the wipes makes it easier to get them into tiny cracks and crevices. The dirt really does stay on the wipe, so you can see just how nasty those surfaces you just wiped were. If that's not enough to make you want to dust more frequently, I don't know what is.

What I do not like about this product is that you really must use gloves with the wipes. I have a latex allergy, and I can't always find the latex-free gloves, plus I kind of resent having to buy more plastic products just to use another product. More for the landfill, more for the Great Pacific Gyre. I tried dusting using just my bare hands, and I was left with an unsavory oily finish on my skin. Worse, it felt toxic and I started getting a little ill after going over only half the room. Now, granted, I've started to get more chemically sensitive as I've gotten older, so you may not have this same reaction, but for me I would probably avoid dusting rather than use these wipes after my initial experience."	&&&
"We usually buy the individual packets that come in a bag of 75 or so. We take 2-4 inside a restaurant with us and usually this is enough for our almost 4 year old and our 8 month old. We like natural products and the wipes are gentle, being alcohol free.

I had never heard of this company previously, but was happy that the wipes claimed to be gentle, alcohol free, and made in the USA. I thought I would give them a try. I guess I was not paying attention to the wipe count of the container, because when these arrived in a large box, I was thinking Amazon combined a few things. The box felt heavier than I was expecting. I opened the box and the only thing in the box was 1 massive container of wipes! There are 150 in the container, and wow this is not going to fit easily in a carry on or diaper bag. (Well it MIGHT fit in one of MY diaper bags/purse, seriously I do like large massive bags, I always have.) The size does hinder it from leaving much space on our changing area. Now I would not be using these for baby's bottom, but I normally like some disinfectant wipes in that area for wiping down the changing pad, the table, and the diaper pail. Since he shares his area with our bedroom, we do not have space for these. So I took these to the suv (which is a small suv now with 2 kids in carseats and a stroller in the trunk area). I was able to find a spot for these. They take some space in the car bag, but they are coming in handy. They have a light fragrance and have Aloe and E in them. They are gentle on hands and seem to clean things well. I do prefer having individually packaged wipes as I can grab a few and leave them in my bag and take them into the store or restaurant. These are best kept for use while in the car, to wipe down messy hands, toys and carseats. They are a nice sized wipe and we like these. However, we would love the company to make smaller sized packs that would fit in a diaper bag. I was sent a container for this review."	&&&
I love this spray I use it on tile. I spray it and leave it on for a few minutes then wipe it off it whitens everything so much. The smell is pleasant also, not overpowering!	&&&
I wasn't sure if these were wet wipes, or dry wipes. They are dry dust wipes that are light to the touch and have a slight pleasing scent to them, nothing you could really smell after application, or even on my fingers after use. I used these to clean around our baseboards and wainscot. It did a good job picking up a lot of lint and dust. It's a bit strange to use because I expect a little shine after I use them, like I would get from a wet wipe or washcloth, but these just feel dry, like your taking a Bounty sheet and wiping off dust. It works however, so I'm impressed and will use them around the house.	&&&
Great for a quick clean up! Sometimes is a bit streaky though.	&&&
awesome product. this product is so much easier than having to spray a product on and wipe it down with a paper towel.	&&&
When I was it I feel confident I have killed the germs that can make my family sick!	&&&
I love their wipes they are easy to use, quick, and effective.	&&&
i use these in our animal hospital for cleaning surfaces and enjoy the smell as well as the convenience'	&&&
What can one say about a diaper wipe except that it does the job. These are nice and thick and the right size	&&&
Always buy for my baby. They work great! My favorite	&&&
I love pampers wipes! They're soft in my babies bottom. They have a clean refreshing scent that is not overpowering. A great high quality wipe for the price!	&&&
But I totally rate them an A! They get the job done! And the grape scent smells fantastic!!! I love that they are saline based!	&&&
these wipes work well and were great when pumping when you were not near a sink. but I will say that I found them unnecessary a lot of the time. If you are near a sink it is easier (and better) to just use that to clean your pump. But when you cannot get to a sink, they are worth it. "	&&&
I use it daily for make up removal. it leaves no residue, it is perfect for my skin.	&&&

I recently got a custom made mouth guard for my upper teeth to help prevent any more damage due to my gnashing my teeth together. I've been wearing it for about 14 hours a day, removing it when I ate and while I slept. It's working even better than I hoped, and my only concern was the bacteria that was probably building up on it. I tried soaking it in mouthwash overnight, but I'm not sure how effective that was, so I decided to try the Fresh Guard wipes. I'm pleased with them so far. They're soft enough to get down into the nooks and crannies of the mouth guard, and it only takes a minute or two to clean the mouth guard.

In the long run, I'll probably go with a liquid soak overnight, maybe the Fresh Guard Soak product, but for now I'm happy to use the wipes to disinfect my mouth guard and get rid of all the nasty stuff that builds up on it."	&&&
"I really love these wipes! They are super handy and work really well! The only issue I have is that the packaging isn't that great. The peel off on top isn't bad, but since the wipes are fairly saturated sometimes the top doesn't stick back.
My advice is to keep them in a ziplock!
Otherwise, this works really well and they are great for when you are on the go!"	&&&
My son has very sensitive skin and when I finally found these wipes we couldn't have been happier!!! I recommend these to everyone!!! Whether you baby has sensitive skin or not they are so gently you will not want any other wipe!	&&&
I use the wipes on my daughter a lot. They clean very well but do not hold moisture like I would like. But they do keep enough moisture to get the job done.	&&&
? it! thick and durable wipes. I like that it's unscented and all natural for my chunky baby boys butt :D	&&&
These wipes are so convenient. We put them in all of our vehicles. Just wish they sold them in the store.	&&&
These wipes are very convient and are great from when you are on the go. I love the ease of this product Fresh Guard wipes are hands down the best. “I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
I enjoy using Clorox wipes in my home. I would recommend them to others. They don't set off my asthma.	&&&
With my first son some wipes would cause him to break out. A friend of mine told me to try these and they worked no more bumps. I love the fact that they are fragrance free and have aloe. I can't wait until little one #2 comes. I will be buying these and only these.	&&&
I highly recommend Pampers Baby Fresh Wipes! They clean great and are made with lotion and water, so they do not dry out as quick if you leave the box open!	&&&
Pampers wipes are extremely moist. I like them cause they do the cleaning, big job for such small wipes. They are so good and the sensitive ones are awesome. My baby's skin is super sensitive so these wipes are awesome."	&&&
this was a great purchase until i was trying to use it for the first time. Imagine you are out and have to change your child's diaper only to open up your wipes and find they are ALL DRIED OUT. This thing is a total fail and not worth a penny.	&&&
My daughter is deployed and wipes where what people asked for on the top of the list.Im sure they will be well used.	&&&
travels well. night cleaner	&&&
Pampers brand baby fresh wipes are more expensive but it's worth it!	&&&
great product !!! my newborn loves it !! no more screaming when changing the diapers ;) yayy	&&&
The plies of wipes doesn't really come out 1 by 1, which is the what this dispenser is suppose to do. it is good that it has a window to show how much wipes are left though. It is very easy to clean. But doesn't work for me.	&&&
Great wipes! very thick and gets mess off easily. not ruff of babies skin at all. This is the only brand i can use without getting a red rash on my sons skin. kinda expensive but well worth it! smells great too!"	&&&
It was not even worth the 1 star I gave it. Had to send it back because it leaked water all over my floor. Very disappointing, I had one for years worked fine, I wore it out. I tried a couple different models. Same problems, leaks.	&&&
"I wanted it for my E Bay Sales. Must be over 500 pixels and it is when used properly.
Didn't like the accessories being shipped in piecemeal. It should have been shipped all together.
The Tripod is a joke."	&&&
I love the convenience of the wipes. I often use the wipe then rinse and use the spray Clorox Cleanser and continue with the same wipe. They are very tough wipes. I use rags as well, but there are some messes that I prefer to use a disposable product for.	&&&
This product gets 5 stars from me, but the package gets 3: it has a peel-back sticker top that when trying to open and close when you are changing a squirmming baby gets to be a bit of a hassle (you need two hands to do it). Also, when you replace the sticker to close it, it is difficult to get it to lay flat again, which leaves little folds that allow air in to dry the wipes out. This would be best placed inside a hard case for wipes, with an easy-open-close lid: just peel the sticker top off and put it inside a hard case, and they will be great!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They remove tough stains and always leave my kitchen looking fresh and clean! The competition does not even compare!	&&&
They are handy when you are on the go all the time.	&&&
Amazing product that makes kitchen cleaning quick and easy!	&&&
They don't smear like some wipes, and a good price for a big box that has lasted me over 2 months	&&&
Love the fresh lemony scent and how clean everything looks and feels in the end.	&&&
i use it in the bathroom to clean the stool and the sink... i love it	&&&
I had never tried this wipe until my second son. My boys have sensitive skin. These wipes clean and do not irritate.	&&&
I used these wipes on sterling silver, silver, and gold jewelry and they worked excellently to remove tarnish and shine them up! I also used it on gemstones and had no problems. It's a great price if you intend to use these wipes for small jewelry. With three wipes I polished five rings, a pair of earrings, and three necklaces. Several of those items were extremely tarnished. This product will go a long way and save trips to a jeweler! I would definitely recommend.	&&&
"Cool product! It's amazing how this product works. :D
Please make more products!"	&&&
The only disinfecting wipes i trust to keep my kitchen clean. I'm always looking for great deals to stock up on these because i use them constantly! Also don't have that nasty smell most cleaners do, they all smell great!	&&&
This wipes dispenser us absolutely awesome. It is very easy to use. It keeps the wipes from drying out, unlike some others. I would definitely recommend this product.	&&&
My daughter hates getting her nose wiped with everything else besides they. With boogie wipes I don't have to worry about her getting a raw, sore nose.	&&&
These wipes a great. They really remove even the darkest of colors without drying your lips. I was using makeup wipes to remove lip color but my lips would burn and feel really raw. These are the perfect solution. They don't have a strange taste either. Sort of a sweet residue if you accidentally lick your lips or get it in your mouth. They are overpriced though so I don't use them on a daily basis. I would use them daily if they were cheaper, 12 bucks for a 10pk of tiny wipes is sort of crazy. Really great product, but four stars because of the price.	&&&
My Mom has been using these products since i was a child...now I'm continuing the tradition! Amazing.	&&&
Amazing Product! I love Clorox, it makes my cleaning experience great. It brightens my day to be able to clean up ad especially with Clorox!	&&&
Got a spill - need to clean it up. Grab a clorox wipe!!!	&&&
So easy to use . clean and disinfect at the same time. i love it.	&&&
Very convenient. I keep one in the office just to disinfect my area. Nice smell also, not overpowering.	&&&
These wipes are amazing and easy to use. I keep a container in each bathroom and kitchen which makes clean up and disinfecting a breeze	&&&
Bought this product thinking it would be pretty much all I needed for keeping my interior surfaces and window clean but I was wrong. The glass cleaner says "no streaks" but I have them everywhere and it irritates me when I drive. The interior wipes suck and leave white pieces everywhere. On top of all that these are expensive and I have to use so many to clean all my windows and they dry out super quick. If your in a hurry to pick up a girl and want your car to look decent these will do a bang up job but will get it done. Only reason I rated 3 stars instead of 2 is because I love armor all products but this one let me down.	&&&
Packets are hard to open, wipes left streaks	&&&
love this product and i would buy it and recommend it to my friends.	&&&
We have tried several different types and brands of wipes, but nothing takes care of my little ones bum like these. Love them!	&&&
These are our favorite wipes. They are not rough at all and moist enough to get the job done.	&&&
Love the wipes. i use it at work so i don't bring the flu virus home.	&&&
I love these towels. I really like having this tanned glow and the towels are super easy to use, no streaks and almost no odor. Just a hint of something but nothing chemical or foul. I will use them again and again. I have noticed that I have had a couple pimples- those deep pimples that don't come to a head but I also get them when I'm hormonal or stressed. I have sensitive skin and I break out VERY easily if a product has oil. I didn't see an ingredient that is an oil derivative so I don't think the wipes caused it. I will say that my tan totally disguises them. Usually I get really red and you can still see them when they are covered with makeup but my tan really hides them.	&&&
convenient product that cleans well and is easy to use	&&&
This is a great product to clean any surface with!	&&&
I have an English bulldog and nothing clears up his folds like these wipes. They are convenient and affordable. I have not had any issues ordering them from amazon. I highly recommend buying this product.	&&&
"The boogie wipes are absolutely amazing. They get the sticky boogies that regular wipes can't. Plus they are super gently and soft on my babies little nose."	&&&
First time I ever got a Zeiss product which was inferior. Wipes are within the date code, but BARELY MOIST when you open the pack. I have to struggle to get the wettest spot on the dirty part of my eye glasses. I would not recommend this product.	&&&
Great wipes. Compared to any name brand this is just as good. They are cheaper and made locally, in my case.	&&&
I love these wipes so much! They are durable yet surprisingly soft. They can clean more than just bottoms! We keep a package in our car, our bathroom, the bedrooms, and in the camper. They are useful for sore runny noses, quick clean ups, spills on clothing, and so much more. They are great for donating to our school nurse and teachers. They are a great value to our family.	&&&
I love love love these wipes. I use them for everything! They are so nice for quick messes to tackling the bathrooms!	&&&
Ease to use as a quick clean up especially in my bathroom. I don't have small children but I do live with males and they are as messy as small children.	&&&
These wipes area a great value as compared to other high dollar wipes and they work great! Being unscented and hypoallergenic is a big plus for us as our little one deserves nothing but the best.	&&&
"I could not remove the wipes from the small opening without tearing them. You have to take the top of the container every time. The wipes leave hazy streaks on the monitor screen. They also do not clean dirt very well. I have used other brands with much more success."	&&&
"This is a great product for the whole family, we use these as adult bathroom wipes, as they are better quality and kinder than other brands. Perfect for sensitive skin.
This is my second time buying from this seller."	&&&
Clorox makes me feel 100 percent sure my house is clean	&&&
I keep in bathrooms to disinfect toilet seats and in the kitchen on the counters.	&&&
"Gumdrop pacifier wipes have a ba smell after wipping pacifier. I returned the item because I was not able to use it."	&&&
Clorox wipes are what I use most frequently. I find them useful for just about everything. I keep a container on every floor. I've been using Clorox products for as a long as I can remember.	&&&
I would buy any scented wipes over these. They have a terrible smell for being ins enter they sure aren't.	&&&
Use wipes everyday for faces, hands and quick clean ups. Thanks	&&&
"Your wipes were the BOMB for all new moms. Moist, durable, and large.
The new product is nothing special. Not moist, no durability and comparable toning sippers Kroger brand. What a shame. You'll be losing customers left and right."	&&&
I use Clorox everyday! With 5 kids at home I try to disinfect daily. Either with the spray or wipes. They are easy to use. I love Clorox!	&&&
I love your products and use them daily in my house!!! I have a toddler And don't know what I would do without ur Clorox wipes.	&&&
Being a mom of five kids is hard work... and messy. Thank goodness for the convenience of these wipes! They are amazing	&&&
Love, love, love these! My son takes them to school to help his teachers out - he's so excited to be a helper in phy ed!	&&&
I have been using Clorox wipes and they are very convenient to quickly disinfect and clean up	&&&
I love how convenient and easy it is to use the disinfecting wipes. It makes cleaning easy for a busy Mom of three.	&&&
Much cheaper than in the store! I love these wet wipes, they make cleaning much easier and faster. This is a great deal, with so many wipes for the dollar. I use them for myself, as I don't have any babies yet!	&&&
I love using these wipes to clean up spills and messes my toddler makes. I feel safe using these products and they are so convenient to grab and use!!	&&&
"I like to use these wipes for the pacifier, not only for when they fall and get dirty, but to wipe them down every once in while to clean the bacteria that grows from baby's mouth naturally. I feel we all get sick from the dirty things we put into our mouths, so these wipes are great to wipe the pacifier down in between the deeper cleanings. I wish they would sell in larger quantities. I love the packaging the hard plastic lid helps keep the wipes moist. I also like that the wipes do not leave any fuzzy residue after using."	&&&
Very good wipes	&&&
I have purchased these wipes multiple times. They are my go to for cleaning off my phone, my devices and my glasses. They don't streak. I use them on my computer screens as well. Cant beat these and they are perfect to stick a few in my briefcase.	&&&
Excellent for cleaning and disinfecting.Good price for product.I also like the deodorizing smell that the wipes have..I also like the convenience of using this product.	&&&
I love all Clorox products from liquid laundry products to disinfectant wipes and sprays. My mother used Clorox all my life and I have continued the tradition.	&&&
I sent these to my sister after she had her first baby. Her and her husband were just buying one pack of wipes every time they went to a store. When these got delivered to their house they called me so excited. They couldn't believe how many you got for such a low price. They had no idea there were things like this out there. I buy them in the store and they are great. Would not change a thing. Sam's is awesome for all your baby needs!!!	&&&
"After hearing my grandson scream every time he had a cold wipe on his bottom, my daughter said she really needed a wipe warmer. The Lionheart does just that! Wipes come out warm and the fussiness has stopped. The only downside is that you have to put water in once a week to make sure the wipes stay moist. The lid is easily opened and we liked the fact that the Lionheart warmer has a bacteria fighting substance manufactured into the plastic to prevent mold and mildew from growing. My daughter is very happy with this warmer."	&&&
I have very sensitive skin with rosacea. I'm also prone to breakouts and these are the only face wipes I have been able use. It's gentle, fragrance free, but strong enough to remove makeup. The price was great which included an added bonus of travel pack (7 wipes) with each pack.	&&&
I love clorox wipes they leave the room smelling nice and fresh.	&&&
good for teenager	&&&
I love all pampers products. I only use pampers. The price and quality are perfect. I love the soft grip texture on these wipes. They really clean and leave him really soft.	&&&
"Each wipe will clean two or three screens - you do need a soft dry cloth or tissue to polish the screen to avoid streaks.
The container is not easy to open or start but once you get it going the wipes really work and the screens stay clean for quite a while.""}}];"	&&&
Love our products and use them daily, would recommend them to anyone. I love knowing my house is extra clean for my grad children to crawl around in. Thanks	&&&
Well, they work well to clean up our baby's diaper mess! Haven't had an issue with these wipes yet. They stay moist and have never ripped	&&&
Ooooh. I just love the orange scent 	&&&
I love this product. It cleans all types of surfaces.	&&&
Love these wipes! They are so convenient and i know my counters are clean and germ free!	&&&
Hopefully it is doing what it claims ( i.e. wipes away a multitude of germs that could be lurking around my glucose blood testing area, and associated equipment.) It was a lot cheaper than the recommended --Super-Sani cloth 9480 used in hospitals. The wipes stay moist in the container, as they should.	&&&
Nice, Smart, disposable Dust Wipes but it's not for all surfaces; left some smudges, my recommendations if not sure - test in a small area first before using it all around or you might damage the finish! Other than that, it was exceptional on a lot of common surfaces!	&&&
I love these wipes! They smell good and clean great.	&&&
They do the job, don't irritate my babys sensitive skin, but weren't as soft as I had hoped.	&&&
My son is very sensitive even to natural and organic wipes. So we were recommended by the Dr. to use these with water or wash (We use California baby wash and it's awesome) during changing time. Our son had the worst diaper rash after the hospital once we switched to using these and he never had diaper rash again. Could be the coconut oil we use in lieu of ointment but I won't go back to wipes ever.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes! They're thick and have enough moisture to get the job done without using ten wipes. They never fall apart or rip when pulling them out of the dispenser. Some others I've tried smell awful when mixed with baby diaper smell, but these smell clean and great! Both my kids have sensitivities to fragrance but had no problem with these!	&&&
My baby has a very sensitive bottom - and these wipes are awesome! The are thick, clean with one wipe, and easy on the tushy.	&&&
great deal for many wipes	&&&
I was very interested in going organic and not buy wipes with so many preservatives in them but just having water in wipes is unsafe. There needs to be some sort of preservative because bacteria will grow rapidly once they are opened. Also, if you have a wipe warmer do not put them in the wipe warmer that is how mold and bacteria form.	&&&
Good wipes just too costly	&&&
Best thing since sliced bread, Wear gloves if you have sensitive skin. Love these.	&&&
The scent was very strong and I thought it smelled more like chemicals than any natural scent. I tried them twice, then threw them out. On the other hand, the natural, unscented pet wipes sold on Amazon work just great!	&&&
"This is literally the best wipe I have ever used. They are very thick, so they do not easily rip. They are so efficient instead of 2-3 wipes I only need one for even a heavily messy diaper. Love them. This is the only wipe I will use."	&&&
Absolutely love these wipes. They are sturdy and soft, and they aren't full of awful ingredients. My pediatrician said to just use cloth and water, but that's not always practical. I use these instead. Never any rashes or issues.	&&&
These wipes are the best. We have been using them on our little guy for a year and a half. They are soft. They get the job done when wiping our baby clean. They have no major scent. They don't seem chemically. They are moist but not too wet and not too dry. They come out of the package easily. We do use a wipes warmer at home, so I can not attest to how well they reseal with the tape that comes on the package on a consistent basis. But in limited use outside of our home, the seal seems fine. I see no reason to try other products for our baby, as we are very satisfied. I would highly recommend these wipes.	&&&
"Awesome!
Very convinient for cleasing all the learher product.
What a wipes!"	&&&
I have five children and each one of them like to come into the kitchen and "help" me with cooking and cleaning. I never know when they have washed their hands last or what they have been touching so the wipes are very nice to have. My children use the wipes to clean up the mess and to make sure their hands are clean.	&&&
Love this product! Great to use to disinfect surfaces to keep my babies healthy.	&&&
I hate to clean but with these wipes, cleaning couldn't be easier	&&&
I use these wipes all the time to disinfect everything. I couldn't live without them.	&&&
Amazing wipes, moistened just right. keep some in my work bag, great for cleaning my eyeglasses, camera lens, tablet and cell phone of the go. a couple of passes and any of the above are clean. Highly recommended.	&&&
my husband is a truck driver and had to share truck with other driver and it's a great way for him to disinfected the steering wheel before his run	&&&
"Great product comes in handy even when on the go.
I have a container in my car all the time and doesn't dry out even with the Texas heat"	&&&
I have to admit that I LOVE PAMPERS wipes. I am not sure why anyone would purchase any other brand of wipes especially when they offer this great sensitive option. Both of my kids have sensitive skin and these have been great for them. Pampers wipes are the best at getting their little bums clean with the least amount of wipes. You get what you pay for when it comes to wipes. They may be more expensive than store brand ones, but you will use FAR less of them.	&&&
These are really great to have on hand. Perfect for small spills or quick clean ups.	&&&
Hi, I have five kids, my youngest is six months. I use a lot of wipes but not as many as I use to. The Huggies Simply Clean wipes do just that. These wipes are nice and thick yet very soft. They clean really big messes with a minimum of wipes usually two maybe three and that means alot to me. The wipes are gentle enough to clean your babies face and soft enough not to make it red. Love these wipes and buying the big box with 768 is the best value. Try it for yourself I know you will agree and n o, I don't work for the Kimberley Clark corp.	&&&
I loved the concept of handy cleansing wipes in bulk at an inexpensive price. Some for purse, car, workbag, lunches, etc. however, upon opening the first individual wipe package I found the wipe almost totally dry and not not usable. I will be returning the box to Staples. The product is a great idea. Could this be old stock that dried out?"}},	&&&
"I'm so happy their is another dusting wipe on the market to try. I use pledge wipes alot and sometimes even the windex wipes. In comparison I do like these clorox wipes alot. Their are 108 wipes total, spread out in two packages of 54. Pending how much you dust will determine how long they last. One wipe can go a long way, they are durable and don't dry out as easily as pledge wipes do. They have a ""weave"" to them which traps the dust and seems to collect it better then the pledge ones. They collect larger dust as well and other things such as pet hair (we have alot of that around!) We have tried them on everything from furniture to my daughters white board, electronics, even the floors! You can NOT use the pledge ones on the floors - it makes things slippery! I like how versatile they are. We easily did an entire room on one wipe.

Like pledge wipes, or any other wipe or dusting product they can leave some residue on certain surfaces so its good to test out. Like pledge, these also left a residue on one of our desks we have here. Its very sensitive and you really can't put much on it to clean it besides a dry cloth. So I can't really say its a complaint because its dry wipe clean only. Everything else its worked great on and so far these do have an edge over pledge wipes!"	&&&
love to use disinfecting wipes when we travel, on airplanes and in hotel rooms !	&&&
I purchased two boxes and I could not believe how bad they smelled. I am in the child care business and usually always buy Huggies wipes but I was never so glad to see the end of these stinking wipes.	&&&
I would prefer that these wipes be larger and softer like Germ-X.	&&&
These are the best wipes available. I love the texture of them and they have never irritated my child's bottom.	&&&
Lysol Disinfecting Wipes are a great way to wipe down areas -quickly and have a fresh smell at the same time. They are so convenient and come in a variety of smells. They make quick work of disinfecting areas--especially during the flu season."}},	&&&
Lysol wipes have a fresh scent and wipes away the germs! What more do you need!!!"}},	&&&
Good wipes for use on baby's bottom, face, and hands. I like them.	&&&
Sturdy and perfect fit for a big pack of wipes. I like the little drawer on the bottom too, handy for creams, nail clippers, etc.	&&&
great thick wipes	&&&
I love these Huggies wipes! They don't contain any harsh ingredients or fragrance, which is great for babies' sensitive skin. They get the job done, too;)	&&&
Dry so fast I'm not gonna order this kind anymore, I love hugees, but those wipes not super good!	&&&
I use this for cleaning the bathrooms & even my phone! Love having this stuff at home	&&&
We've tried a few different brands and keep coming back to pampers wipes. They clean very well and are very gentle on my sons sensitive skin. They also don't dry out quickly either if I forget to close the lid.	&&&
These Pampers Sensitive Wipes work great in combination with the Swaddlers Sensitive Diapers for newborn use. They get the job done quickly without added friction of extra wiping.	&&&
"Wow! I love these. I used to buy disposable, pre-moistened wipes from LensCrafters. I tried to get them when they were on sale, but even then they were still relatively expensive. I think I paid around $20 for 32 wipes from LensCrafters...I'll never do that again!

I haven't properly cleaned my glasses in a while. I ran out of wipes and I don't like to clean them the old-fashioned way very often. But after using these wipes, my glasses are finally clean and smudge-free.

On a side note: I have an anti-glare coating on my glasses that doesn't work very well when they are dirty. After cleaning with these wipes, there are no glares for me!"	&&&
Little one loves to chew on all things paper and is not too interested in tooth brushes or fingertip brushes yet. He allows us to wipes his teeth and gums and then chews on these. Heard that zylitol will also help with the prevention of ear infections, so a win win.	&&&
very good .. love it	&&&
I love the smell:) Smell of clean!	&&&
This makes my old wooden furniture look new with a deep shine. Much better than Pledge wipes.	&&&
I like how the wipes cleans the surface and kills germs and smells great.	&&&
I received these wipes free for the purpose of a review. These opinions are 100% my own. I love that the wipes are strong, not too wet, and are safe for my baby. Love that they are hypoallergenic and gentle on my baby's bottom.	&&&
A little annoying that I have to keep replacing the pad, but it is good. Now that I know how often to replace, what NOT to use in my cloth wipe solution (no coconut oil!) it keeps my wipes moist and sanitized. When i was using the coconut oil in my homemade cloth solution, it made the wipes and the pad stinky. Without it, it keeps it fresh! Highly recommended! I don't think i replace it as often as I'm supposed to, I replace about every 4 months? Keeps it fresh for a long time! Make sure to re-moisten this pad whenever you replace the wipes	&&&
I use the product once a day, at night. My new favorite brand of face wipes & I've tried many.	&&&
I love these products. They smell great and clean and disinfect perfectly. I travel with them and even keep them in all of my cars.	&&&
A great investment when it comes to my child's welfare. It definitely helps in her classroom!	&&&
Great for glasses, camera lenses, computer screens. Great to leave in coat pockets, cars, etc, so one is always available to wipe away smudges. Being single use, these wipes don't build up oils, residue, dirt or other scratching particles.	&&&
i would use this for any occasion. family events, picnics to use.	&&&
Wipes are strong, and wet well. I love having a product without lots of chemicals to use for my baby.	&&&
wonderful smell and makes it very easy to clean up kitchen and bathroom after my 6 kids	&&&
excellent wipes. Very gentle and mosit	&&&
will not use any other disinfecting wipes - awesome!	&&&
Great Wipes.	&&&
Everyone in the family loves these wipes. They are great for eye glasses, iPhones, iPads, laptops, desktop monitors, etc. I will purchase more of these in the future. They are also great to keep a few packs in my travel bags for use during business trips	&&&
They are convenient to use and a quick way to disinfect surfaces.	&&&
"Keeps the wipes nice and warm for use, once they warm up. It plugs into the wall, so you need to make sure you have space for it on your changing table / area along with a free outlet.
This is definitely not a must have, unless you have a really finicky baby who is very sensitive to the cold/room temp wipes. I've only been using this for a month, so I have not seen any browning on the wipes, but I expect to have to replace the moist pad in the future to avoid that.
Overall, it's a nice to have item for the nursery."	&&&
i prefer the pampers wipes, these tend to dry out or not have as much moisture or thickness to the wipe when compared to pampers wipes.	&&&
I use these to wipe down my dog's paws after trips outside since our indoor potty station is, well, full of pee, and outside it's a rainy and dirty city. The wipes don't come out of the container quite as smoothly as I'd like, but the product itself works well, smells good, and isn't too harsh or toxic to my dog's skin.	&&&
Great for cleaning in the kitchen. Excellent product!!!	&&&
OXO Products are usually great, but this is just average. It doesn't seem to be airtight and the wipes dry out easily.	&&&
Effective - disinfectant for clothes, floors, bathroom, kitchen and entire household use	&&&
had this product a little over a year. lid never closed right. wipes close to the bottom were HOT, too hot to put on the baby so I had to cool them before using. the fresh pads were gross. after about a year of use quit working. the point where the cord plugged into the warmer melted into the socket	&&&
I received these free from the hospital and they're the best ones pampers makes. The smell is good, it's not really a fragrance but more I guess of a baby smell and they're really thick! I was told huggies wipes were better but I guarantee these are the best wipes on the market!	&&&
Love these wipes! Perfect to carry in my purse too.	&&&
I have to say that Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are my favorite cleaning product. They are easy to use and work on so many different surfaces that I dread cleaning if I run out!	&&&
I trust in the long standing Clorox name and always will.	&&&
I can always depend on Clorox products to clean and disinfect my home and my work area thoroughly and safely. I trust that it works because it's Clorox.	&&&
Works like a charm dirty grease spots comes right off	&&&
I use these wipes more that I use paper towels. Perfect for quick clean up especially with a germy preschooler.	&&&
Man I dont know why I am writing this review, but sure why not, my wife uses this stuff and my house seems to be clean when I walk in after a long day of work and my house seems to be clean after she has a long full day of eating bon bons like peg from married with chilren.	&&&
I love these for the kids to clean up behind themselves after meals. No spray bottle needed. Just wipe and done.	&&&
These wipes are amazing. I really like them because they are larger than the average facial wipe and they leave my skin soft and not dry like a lot of makeup removers.	&&&
My family has been use Clorox bleach for years. I love everything about it.	&&&
I use them to remove stains on my cloth chairs also use it on my carpet.	&&&
Every clorox product I've bought as been great. I love it because It gets rid of what the label describes.	&&&
awesome product love to use clorox products keeps the house germ free	&&&
I have used Weiman granite counter products for over 16 years. I have been so pleased with their sprays that I thought I would give this disposable cloth a try. I found the cloths to be quite different from the spray products int hat they did not leave a streak free counter top. It is handy because it is pre -moistened but I went back to my Weiman sp[rays to get \\that really clear looking finish. I will use up what I bought for a fast fresh-up but the regular sprays- both the cleaner and the polish are my preference for top notch appearance."}},	&&&
I clean my bathroom with it, its fast and leave everything disinfected.	&&&
i have never found any wipes to equal these. Never.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are the only cleaning wipes I use. They have the best scents so you don't get that bleach smell after cleaning and they really do a good job of picking up all the stains.	&&&
These wipes are fantastic! I am truly addicted to these...lol. These wipes take off waterproof eye makeup so easily without pulling out your lashes! :-) The formula is nice and not oily and has a nice smell as well. Well worth the price in my opinion! Thanks Tarte!	&&&
We bought this caddy to hold diapers and wipes in our basement family room. It looks nice and takes up a minimal amount of space. So far, it seems pretty durable, but like others said, it's a lot of money to spend on something that pretty much feels like cardboard. No issues yet, though. It looks great and we're hoping it will last long.	&&&
I really like that the Clorox wipes are affordable and easy to use. I use them threw out the whole house, from sticky kids messes to kitchen clean up after cooking.	&&&
"I’d been using a 360-degree duster on a handle that makes things easy to reach in tough places. But I have to say that these Clorox Dust Wipes actually pick up more dust than that other brand does, especially on my TV and the cabinet it sits on that tends to draw more dust. The cloths are dry, somewhat stretchy and are non-abrasive. They’re great for getting into corners or small crevices and I’ve yet to have one rip.

And I’ve found it’s true that one can do an entire room, using both sides of the cloth, even when that room holds multiple bookcases; so lots of surfaces. The dirt does not shake off. Took some into work and even we cleaned between the keys on our keyboards and the other places the monthly cleaning crew misses. We’re doing less sneezing."	&&&
what a great product, i use Clorox clean-up on just about any and every thing i clean. It smells great and i know that the surface is clean enough for my 1 yr old son to touch...I just love the smell of it, when i smell it; it reminds me of the house i grew up in cuz that is one of my fondest childhood memories of me running through my house just after my grand-mother would clean something!!!!	&&&
Great products. Everything smells so fresh and you know its clean	&&&
I love these clorox wipes. They're especially great to have around during Flu season. Plus, unlike most cleaners, their smell isn't too overwhelming. Everything just smells clean.	&&&
Excellent cleaning wipes. Will be getting them again.	&&&
I used this product when my son was very young but am now employing it for my own personal hygiene. It's very nice for freshening up during the day. I wouldn't be without it. I know there are versions of this product on the market for adults, but I find baby wipes to be much more cost-effective.	&&&
love the way it cleans and disinfects at the same time	&&&
These are so easy to use and makes the nightly beautification process much easier. You don't have scrub, which can be bad for your skin, you just wipe a few times and everything is all clean!	&&&
We use these wipes on my father who has had a stroke and is unable to walk. He is confined to the bed and his skin is highly prone to breakdown and rashes, even more so than an infant. I think the ingredients in these wipes have helped keep his skin in good condition. The scent is far more pleasant than many of the adult wipes. I really love the ingredient list and only try to use skin and bodycare products free of chemicals if possible for my entire family.	&&&
I like this product because I like the bigger canisters of these. Works great, can always count on Lysol wipes for cleaning at my house. Anything from the bathroom, to the kitchen, to the living room. These wipes clean it all. I will continue to purchase these.	&&&
Mal-a-ket wipes are a staple in the care of my bulldogs who have skin issues. They are good to help keep away many small inflamations so that they don't become larger problems. I am very pleased to have found a vendor so that I can order them directly whenever my dogs need them.	&&&
Can't go wrong with Huggies wipes, they are hands down the best. We use a warmer and the little one relaxes vs the crying agitated baby we used to have with using 40 wipes to get that bottom clean.	&&&
Perfect for all types of jewelry...the wipes a smaller than the ones before (I bought years ago) but they do the job...Cleaned up even the cheapest jewelry..looked new! Good price too	&&&
I am not a mom, but I do use these wipes for the babies at my work. These are amazing! It's soft and gentle to their noses and it works well to get the crusty snot without the redness. They also smell great! I only wish there were more in the pack since it runs out fast when the babies have a cold.	&&&
"I have not purchased these from Amazon but I used to use flushable wipes on my husband. DO NOT FLUSH these down the toilet. I live in the city and after a $1,000 plumber experience it was the ""flushable"" wipes that were clogging the main drain. I'm still cleaning down the basement.
Keep a small trash can with a plastic liner in it and dispose of them this way. Not at handy or sanitary as flushing but you really don't want to clog your drain!!"	&&&
This wipes perfumed heavily to the point that I don't want to use them. I don't understand why the smell has to be so strong, unless to mask something. I like the size and the thickness of this wipes but the perfume kills it for me. I wish I could return them...	&&&
Always buy Huggies :) They are thicker than other brands so they won't rip at inconvenient times;) They are very convenient for wiping not only hineys but also messy fingers"	&&&
This product has been order three times by me... twice last year and once this yr. I like the way smell and feel. I use these everywhere I go. I slip a few in my purse and have often in the past given them to strangers who needed something to wipe their hands.	&&&
I find Huggies to be one of the best wipes out there.	&&&
I purchased these as part of a pantry gift for a friend who needed some help in feeding a family of 5! She reports that they arrived in good shape. She is dealing with a high risk health of a child... so cleaning door knobs and other surfaces is daily thing. I hope these will help.	&&&
These aren't my favorite...quite stretchy and the container has a design flaw that causes many wipes to come out at a time. They are ok, but not my go to wipe brand.	&&&
Excellent Product at the right price.	&&&
I ordered a 12 pack Of these wipes and am very disappointed in the ingredients list, and wont be using them. The company should really list a full ingredients description on the listing. There are at least two chemical ingredients that the EWG lists that I have comcerns about. I read the company's response to another reviewer who was concerned about the ingredients as well; they stated that the toxic ingredients were only in a small amount. Just a small amount of poison is too much for me. It's frustrating when companies market their products as natural or gentle but put toxic ingredients in them. I feel duped. I would not recommend these wipes.	&&&
Individually packaged antibacterial alcohol wipes are great for many uses. Hand wipes for Preventing spread of colds, flu or skin infections. Make sure you do not touch clothes, materials, some plastics or surfaces that alcohol can take the color out of or damage. We even use them to to clean in the house, kitchen, bathroom, or outdoor on hard surfaces. Removing gum, etc. We carry them on road trips, for hotels, and in our purses for going to restaurants or fast food to clean up the tables or chairs to sanitize. Great for hotel or motel rooms to clean doorknobs, remotes, counters, etc. We have not had a Cold or sickness since we started using them about 4 years ago. I highly recommend.	&&&
Pampers wipes are far better then other wipes and thus you end up using less of them. Much better then toilet paper for Jitters ones.	&&&
These Pampers wipes are awesome. I've always relied on both Pampers wipes & diapers and have no interest in trying any other brands. I was excited to find the "natural and clean" formula so I know that I'm using a healthy, gentle product on my little one. Thanks for the consistently awesome products Pampers!	&&&
"Love it for new born babies. Best to get unscented in case of any allergic reaction.

I would recommend to others."	&&&
These a great wipes. These are my number two wipes... Just behind water wipes but for the price you can't really beat it. They are thick enough to do the job but not too thick or bulky. I think that these wipes, like most, get too wet down at the bottom of the bag, but turning the bag over upon occasion should keep all wipes wet enough. There is a slight smell but it is not offensive. Does the job!	&&&
I love clorox disinfecting wipes. I buy them all the time especially to donate to my daughter public school class!	&&&
Having 2 kids, I absolutely recommend Clorox easy wipes. Fresh scent, clean, and go!	&&&
I love the clorox wipes, I have them in my kitchen and my bathroom. They come in handy. And I use clorox bleach for my whites.	&&&
always have use the product especially when i have kids ti clean after them	&&&
Best wipes ever. I use them to clean my iPhone, glasses, iPod, computer screens, work phone...everything!	&&&
Exactly what I wanted!	&&&
As a runner, I totally love these! I used them during Ragnar and felt like I had just taken a shower. I'll also throw them in my bag if I'm going to go for a run or go to yoga and then to dinner or something after... I don't feel gross anymore and feel so clean. The clothes feel just like a towel... not a wimpy baby wipe!	&&&
These wipes cut through any mess my toddlers can make!	&&&
The lemony scent is wonderful and I love the way it cleans and disinfects.	&&&
"boogie wipes worked great I will definitely buy this product again"	&&&
"I've been using these wipes for years, and I really like them - as does my pooch Niki. Sure...she's not a fan of having me put my fingers in her mouth :), but she likes the taste of the pads. That's what sold me on them the first time that I tried them. Niki will gladly lick one of these pads for several seconds, which not only tells me that she likes the taste, but it also helps to clean off her tongue.

In addition to Niki liking them, they do help keep her teeth clean. She hates when I try to brush her teeth, but she tolerates this much better. I try to use one every morning after our walk, and she knows it's coming - and doesn't avoid it. I wipe her teeth with one side of the pad, and then I flip it over to the clean side to let her lick it.

I like the size of them now that I'm used to them, but they can take a little while to get used to. Be careful at first to keep a grip on them because they can get pulled from your hand if your pooch is licking, and you probably don't want them to swallow these. I don't know if these would hurt Niki if she swallowed one, but I'd rather not find out.

The container is great. The lid screws on and seals in the moisture, and I've never once gotten to the bottom of a stack and had a dry pad.

I can't remember all of the dental products that I've tried, but these are the ones that I decided on and have stuck with for years. I absolutely recommend them."	&&&
These wipes worked out great for our kids that had sensitive skin. Other wipes broke our kids out so we had to keep two different kinds of wipes on hand because our kids would break out. When we found these it was great because now we can just use these for all the kids and we don't have worry about grabbing the wrong wipe for the child we are using it on.	&&&
The wipes are lifesavers. Especially in my car. I keep them in my glovebox or center console and use them on a regular basis. With my 5 year old forever making messes with snacks and drinks, these help me keep my car clean.	&&&
These are my go to product every time I need to do A quick wipe down in our kitchen or bathrooms. Cleans well and smells great!	&&&
Cheaper than store-bought. I need the sensitive natural kind, but I wish they had a better, natural scent. I have been using these for years and my grandson has never had a diaper trash.	&&&
wet cleaning wipes are really convenient in the car. just wipe gently without exerting much pressure when you need to clean the inside of your car.	&&&
First of all, I just did not expect how MANY wipes I'd be receiving. For the price, I think these were a screaming deal. As far as the quality, they are right up there with the Huggies and Pampers brand wipes in terms of their ability to clean up a poopy mess. However, these being for sensitive skin, I find that they are also more gentle than the other brands. Unlike the other wipes we've used, water is the main liquid ingredient. The second ingredient is chamomile. So these are just the right amount of delicate for our little boy's bottom. I love that they're natural and gentle, but still go to work to clean up serious messes. The wipes are also textured with little dots to better capture "debris" with every swipe. I would definitely buy these and recommend them to any parent.	&&&
I love this stuff. The things you can clean with this is amazing.	&&&
Clorox wipes are perfect for this house and all these kids. We use them everyday on bathrooms, kitchen, and even the car! Its a great easy and fast way to keep things tidy and disinfected!	&&&
Love Clorox products. I know when I use clorox my house not only smells great, but I can be at ease knowing the germs are gone!!	&&&
These wipes worked fine Cleans screens good. The anti static seems to keep dust from building up as quick. Price seems a bit high.	&&&
Nice wipes. Could be a little thicker. Never have to worry about them being dry and rough.	&&&
These wipes are thick and really get the job completed.	&&&
I just love these wipes. They make life so much easier and the price is great.	&&&
"My husband does construction so at the end of his day in the summer his white's are not white.I soak his tee shirts in clorox and warm water before i wash them for about half hour.They are already back to white.After washing them they are white as white can be, Thank you.
The wipes i use every day cause we have a 2 year old granddaughter we have every night,so to keep things clean and disinfected.Been working out great."	&&&
I use Clorox Disinfecting wipes at work for daily cleaning at my desk. This flu season has not been pleasant - especially when you work in a call center. I feel better knowing my space is disinfected and smells good, I even have a go-pack... just in case!	&&&
First time buying this scented baby wipes. As expected, it does come with great smell. My kid love the sweet smell. Just one feedback on the packaging, it is flimsy and likely to torn if you don't keep inside the box. As for the frozen print, it doesn't look impressive. I think I would have just order the normal packaging to save some cost.	&&&
love it great cleaning product and pricing is reasonable. I clean very well with and great use for stain removers	&&&
boogie wipes worked great I will definitely buy this product again	&&&
I use clorox wipes every day. I love their convenience and their disinfecting power!	&&&
Great price for this many wipes	&&&
Thick, strong and just enough moisture to wipe away the most challenging messes. Great price as well!	&&&
"Must say I was disappointed with this product, 1. Because the towels are wet and the closure is tight to keep them moist, it appears that they are molding on the edges.
2. They made my screens better but now completely clean of fingerprints.""}},"	&&&
i absolutely love the pampers sensitive wipes! they aren't to thick and aren't to thin, and are very gentle on my little angel:)	&&&
I love clorox wipes, they dont stink, but smell pleasantly. They dont leave any streaks on my appliances or other	&&&
i ordered this product mainly because it covers 3 teething stages. theres a step one, a step 2, and a step 3. they sent me a step one and two step twos. not only that, but they failed to send me the pacifier and teething wipes that were suppose to be with the order. i would not recommend ordering	&&&
I tried 2 or 3 brands so far and this is the only one that feels nice. It doesn't "grip" like other brands. After trying a few types, I decided to buy 2 cases of 1000 wipes.. I also use them myself, they,re the best!	&&&
Clorox Wipes are very easy to use. They easily clear away grime for clean-up of "after dinner" messes. They smell amazing and I feel comfortable that they clear away germs as claimed.	&&&
"Hi! Are you sick of winter yet? Ready to get some sun? I know I am! My tan is starting to fade from this summer, and i'm becoming this pasty white. I don't usually mind, but I've been wearing dresses more often lately, so I wanted my legs to be just a bit less pasty-looking. I don't fake-bake, so I decided to break down and try sunless tanning wipes. I figure they've reformulated it a ton since the days of streaky orange spray tans...
These wipes are really nice! They come in a super-handy dispenser box, which dispenses one individually-wrapped wipe at a time. These wipes are a bit smaller than some of the other wipes that I've seen, but I think that's nice, because I can focus on one part of my body at a time, without worrying that it will dry out before I use it all. I'm a bigger girl, so I learned very quickly that I should use one wipe per leg..otherwise, by the time I get to my thighs, there isn't much left on the wipe, and it gets streaky. It's really, really important to make sure that you cover every inch of your skin to prevent streaking.

If you're expecting immediate results, you'll be disappointed, as I was...but about 5 hours later, I had a nice, natural-looking tan on my legs! I would recommend practicing using these, as there is a teeny bit of a learning curve, in figuring out how to get a streak-free tan, so If you have a big event coming up, start a few weeks ahead of time, just to get the hang of things!
I really like the quality of tan that these wipes provided.
I received these tanning wipes for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use. I was not told what to say, only asked to give an honest review based on my own experience with the product."	&&&
Good product, but you're paying for the name and they do the job for you. I do recommend them.	&&&
"They are a great alternative to dry tissues"	&&&
"I purchased these as foot wipes and occasional face wipes for my 10lb poodle mix. Overall the smell is pleasant and mild, but the cleaning strength is inadequate. I own human face wipes that have more moisture.
After reading the reviews, I immediately put my wipes in a ziplock bag and then back into the container in which they arrived to preserve the moisture. Even with this precaution, I find that the wipes are overall very dry and I have to use three for a light ""sponge bath"" on a small dog.
I appreciate that these are safe and made in the USA, but I think they could be better."	&&&
i recommend to ppl that havekidthey make aalot of mess its esay to use fast to clean	&&&
LOVE these! Easy to use, and smell awesome! I use my yoga mats daily for variety of activities dealing with my workouts, and I've been looking for an easy hassle free way to clean them after my workout that won't take forever. This was perfect. I leave it by my workout area. I pull one out, wipe down the mat, and then throw it away. Mat is clean and able to air dry until my next workout, and bonus, it smells like lavender! Super easily, and a must grab for any other fitness enthusiasts! I even toss them into my bag and bring them to the gym or any other workout aspace! :)	&&&
i LOVEE Josie marans skincare line and have high expectations.. but these wipes were a let down. VERY AVERAGE, nothing really special... scent was decent, texture of wipes were decent, pretty oridnary... only thing it has going for it is that a portion helps out polar bears. other than that, not much else to say about the product itself. it DOES remove my eyeliner & mascara, but all wipes should do that anyway.	&&&
I love this product! I have a canister in every room in my house!	&&&
I love using this product for quick and easy clean up.	&&&
very convenient, love the smell , great when u have little ones	&&&
Easy to use, and price is ok when you find a good deal.	&&&
I have been using clorox for years. It is always been a dependable cleaning product in my mom's household, and now in mine. There has never been a question as to what product to use on my whites, counter tops, basically anything that I can clean!	&&&
I love how clean they make everything and can clean anything (mirrors, TVs, counter spaces etc.) They never smudge or anything, they are the best.	&&&
Very nice quality but too pricey.. I just use regular baby wipes instead.	&&&
I use the clorox toilet cleaner cause it clings to the sides and gets all the grime off every single time!!	&&&
"It is worthless for screen cleaning. Makes streaks that are hard to remove.It is good for cleaning up key boards."	&&&
What a great concept in baby wipes dispensing. Having every single wipe pop up through the opening, is pure genius!	&&&
I love that Clorox wipes keep y home clean and are right at the tip of my fingers!	&&&
"I have not used yet but I also got this product as a gift
but I have used the member's mark wipes in the past and they are a great product"	&&&
"The screen cleaning wipes are effective and work well. I like the decorative pop-up container that looks pretty sitting on my desk. They are always at hand when I need them."	&&&
I purchased this product as a package deal with a can of air. My husband needed the air. I wanted the wipes to keep my laptop monitor clean. Well before I got to use them my husband took them. He cleaned his work laptop and work desk computers. He loves this product.	&&&
awesome product. I really really really like to use them for how easy they are to use.	&&&
I love clorox products :) They are great products for the best price :)	&&&
I work in a clinic setting and this along with my personal home is my go-to wipe. They disinfect your everyday viruses and with lots of flu virus going around this is perfect to keep me and my family from getting sick!	&&&
"Convenient in the kitchen/bathroom and has a light, understated scent!"	&&&
I can't say enough good about the Clorox wipes! They work on everything! My stainless steel appliances, counters, tile, tub and they even remove make up stains from clothes!!!	&&&
My family loves clorox wipes. We clean with them every day. Even my 9 year old can clean with them.	&&&
I ordered this so that I can have my wet wipes easily accessible. However, the container is not air tight, so the wipes dried out. If I want to use it, I have to find wipes in packages that would fit in this container. Waste of money ((	&&&
Love the product! We have 5 kids and it makes keeping the house clean easy!	&&&
I love these wipes, they are very quick and easy to grab for my boy's messes that they make daily.	&&&
"These wipes are terrible to Zeiss a couple of years ago. They smear. They dry-out immediate. The new wipes use isopropanol and ethanol with ethanol being the new ingredient. Ethanol is basically corn liquor, commonly called white lightning. In that it is generally corn based would explain the smearing on my glasses. Zeiss is using ethanol because it is cheaper. WELL, IT DOES NOT WORK.

I am going back to pure isopropanol."	&&&
For certain cleanups,the 'one-use' wipes are my go to item. Fragrance is not overwhelming; lots of allergies in my home.	&&&
I use these for everything from wiping kitchen and bathroom surfaces to disinfecting and cleaning my car!	&&&
They cleaned the poop amazingly. I highly recommend them for any and all poop related emergencies. One time my daughter decided to projectile poop out of her bassinet a good three foot arc and hit me square in the chest. Huggies Simply Clean Baby Wipes saved the day and my shirt. I don't know what I would do without them.	&&&
VERY GOOD PRODUCT1 I would recommend it to everyone!	&&&
Awesome stuff! Nothing whitens or disinfects like Clorox!	&&&
it's great to use when you have a puppy that drools a lot.... And great for disinfecting too...	&&&
GREAT PRODUCT VERY CONVENIENT TO USE ANYWHERE AND TO TAKE EVERYWHERE WHEN YOUR OUT.	&&&
"This is my second season of riding with the Grease Monkey in my bike go-bag ... somehow I always seem to get chain grease on my leg during a ride, and these wipes get it off quickly, cleanly and with no reaction from my ultra-sensitive skin.
For you roadies, they also come in single-serve packages as well."	&&&
these are much better than I thought they would be they feel very refreshing and don't dry out my skin.	&&&
Love the convenience of the wipes and I feel confident that it is disinfecting whatever surface I am cleaning. I use product on a daily basis.	&&&
This product is quite good and not oily or stinky like sheala shine but I prefer the spray version. The wipes are a little too wet when you first start using them and they leave a white residue which I have to wipe away with a towel so the wipe is kind of pointless unless you are doing a large surface that requires a lot of cleaner. I do like the spray version much better, you can control the amount you use. The wipes are best on larger stainless surfaces like a barbeque grill or counters but for small touchups like vent hoods these are too wet with product, the spray bottle is better and I prefer it over this for my needs.	&&&
Would love if the price was a little lower, but still worth the expense! After four kids with sensitive skin, these finally have kept us from having to spend our life savings on diaper rash cream for our two little ones. We tried every other wipe out there and ended up with a rash every single time. After using these, we haven't had one in either child. They are thick and strong. My only complaint would be that the design of the resealable package isn't the best, but a ziplock ba g took care of any moisture loss. Definitely would recommend!	&&&
With two small children these wipes are a must have!!	&&&
I wanted something to use instead of ruining wash cloths with makeup. I also wanted something compact for when I travel. These were on sale so I decided to try them. They have been great and really fit the bill for what I wanted. Thanks for the great sale.	&&&
I love this, it gives a piece of mind of overall clean for my two year old and one year old. Love it	&&&
Clorox is the only disinfecting wipes we use to clean the bathroom counter tops and kitchen counter tops.	&&&
I used various brands but Pampers sensitive wipes is my favorite product for my child!	&&&
I'm the overly cautious type- I would never want anything harsh to bother his perfectly baby-soft skin. These wipes are our favorites! Strong enough to do the job, but soft enough to leave baby happy.	&&&
great product to disinfect easily available to have in different rooms of the house	&&&
All I have to say I love these wipes to the fullest I would use them myself so soft keeps my little girl happy	&&&
These are super soft wipes that don't leave a tissue type residue behind.	&&&
The small packs of grape wipes are made of softer material and wipe better. This material is a little bit harder and slicker.	&&&
I trust Clorox Brand cleaning products to clean, brighten and disinfect.	&&&
the wipes are not warm inside	&&&
I use these wipes in my nursery. I like that I can get rid of bacteria and freshen up all in one wipe.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes in my kitchen nearly every day!	&&&
Hands down a must have for any household! Simply put, there is nothing faster grab and wipe up a soiled spot! It's perfect for cleaning up spills and pet accidents. It not only cleans and deodorizes but it disinfects! Love a clean home! Love my Clorox Disinfecting Wipes!	&&&
Makes cleaning easier. Easy to locate, store, and carry around!	&&&
I really love the fact of how easy clean up is with the clorox wipes!! Even the kids can use them for easy clean ups!	&&&
So easy for chasing after little ones messes. I prefer the orange sent however the lemon is pleasant and refreshing.	&&&
"Pampers is high quality wipes
Like the smell and how soft they are
Did not bother my kids skin
Many uses"	&&&
There is no other product that can work as best as Clorox. Brightens clothes. Removes stains. Soaking, disaffecting, removes odor and cleaning. There is something really special about smelling Clorox. The smells is satisfying. Lets you know it's clean...EmilySC	&&&
Have it on my subscribe and save. Can never have too many of these. Though I appreciate the ease of the size of these packs, I would like it if they had them in the economy dispenser like the other flavors.	&&&
Used these wipes since my baby's birth! Love them!	&&&
Love these wipes but cheaper at Target.	&&&
I have 2 dogs, so between spills and accidents these wipes are really handy!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. Its good for disinfecting everything from door knobs to counter tops.	&&&
These should just be called how to kill your dog. The wipes are so thin and small. Your dog could easily choke. I sent them back immediately.	&&&
Love the wipes. Must have for any home. Perfect for homes with pets	&&&
At one time your Cottonelle Flushable Moist wipes were available asa single package ( 1 wipe ). They were given free with box of regularwipes. These were excellent, are they available?	&&&
Im very picky with my baby wipes and i like them to be thick and not too wet . I currently use huggies one and done and i dont think i'll be switching.	&&&
Gets all my makeup off, non greasy, and quick	&&&
Liked the size of the wipes.	&&&
Everything was as expected.	&&&
I purchased these makeup wipes with points, not sure how they would work. My face is oily and prone to break outs. These wipes smell wonderful, clean your face well, and reacted great with my skin.	&&&
I've been using this brand since I had my daughter 5 yrs ago. Now i am using it for my 16 months old. It's very convineint especially on the go. Perfect for my little guy because it's always a battle trying to wipe off boogey or snot off him. This wipe just makes it that much easier.	&&&
Great wipes & good price	&&&
Good price for these wipes. Small package ideal for car.	&&&
I got these because I tend to be to lazy to wash my face at night . These are by far the worst make up remover wipes I have ever used . They are not gentle on the skin and all. I feel like I am using sand paper to remove my make up. To top it all off, because it is so harsh on the skin, I woke up the next morning with one of my eyelids swollen. I originally thought it was maybe because I was too rough . I used it again a few weeks later when I was desperate and the same thing happened on one of my eyes. These went straight to the trash. I don't understand where the good reviews come from. I am better off using Elf make up wipes the this garbage	&&&
We have used these wipes for three years, and I am sad to say the design has changed for the worst. These used to be large, luxurious and soapy- very effective bottom cleaners, and they kept our hands free of poo during the messiest changes. They are now small, wafer-thin, textured and much dryer. Our hands nearly always get dirty during a change now- requiring extra wipes to clean hands before re-diapering the baby! It took much trial and error to find these in the first place, and now we must find another brand. Its pretty bold to make such a significant design change for a product parents rely on! I'd love to hear the company's explanation.	&&&
I keep the wipes in my travel bag. But I am not sure I want them anymore. The smell is too strong, and I don't like the smell of it.	&&&
"The wipes get the job done but have a weird taste that my newborn doesn't like."	&&&
Not quite tasteful for babies. Bad idea for babies to put their pacifier in their mouth after being wiped with one of these wipes.	&&&
I REALLY ENJOY CLEANING WITH CLOROX! I FEEL EVERYTHING IS VERY CLEAN AFTERWARDS. LOVE THE PRODUCT!	&&&
i like it, because it is not an expensive product. and it really cleans	&&&
I have tried many brand wipes and these are the best for my baby girls booty! No irritation and cleans beautifully!	&&&
We love the clorox wipes! especially with a little one around the house. You wipe and it's disinfected	&&&
"These little wipes worked very well for wiping the glass on my scanner. I liked the fact they didn't leave
any lint after wiping a surface. Great little wipes."	&&&
Great wipes for cleaning class tables.	&&&
I used it for my kids mess!! And donates to school..	&&&
Really love using Clorox products. The scent isn't too strong for my son to use even with him having asthma. Love how easy it is to wipe things clean with out a lot of pressure!	&&&
Love the ease and effectiveness of this product. I use it in the kitchen, bathroom, and office. Smells great too	&&&
Love this product works great and does what I need it to do.	&&&
If anything spills grabbing a clorox disinfecting wipe is the quickest and easiest way to go!	&&&
No other product out there, often imitated never duplicated...	&&&
CLOROX IS A NAME BRAND PRODUCT THAT I TRUST AND IT WORKS WELL.	&&&
"I have not used this product but twice now, still testing it out so this is my first impression rose. I found things I like and dislike so far:
Cons:
1.) (maybe it's just me) The wipes are very hard for me to use, they get all bunched up and I can't get a good wipe with them, maybe because they are too thin?
2.) It takes several to cover your entire body
Pros:
1.) Does not smell like self tanner! I can use before bed and sleep and not sleep like self tanner
2.) It does leave a nice color

I might try the same brand lotion to see if I can use that easier??"	&&&
Handy and work Great ! I heard about these from a friend, and immediately went to Amazon to buy them. They are not messy, and my Silver has never looked so shiny and new. I plan to take a few on my upcoming cruise, to keep things looking nice.	&&&
I love to take these when I travel to wipe down airplane trays, hotel rooms, and bathrooms.	&&&
love these they clean really well and I feel like they get rid of the germs, they smell great also	&&&
this product does the job as it says it would. good	&&&
Huggies Simply clean wipes are very soft and gentle for baby skin, this is also thicker than any other wipes, no fragrance or alcohol makes even better to use for my little one.	&&&
I've tried many different brands and so far this is the best. The box is very well designed, wipes are thick and work really well.	&&&
Perfect on baby and toddlers with sensitive skin. The wipes are super soft and don't give rashespecially or burn my child.	&&&
Strong product! Can't wait to test out their other products!	&&&
"Nice big buckets for me to wipe down my whole place. Smells nice.

Wipes and cleans everything. Stains are removed and color are restored.

Very slight sticky after wipe. So I follow up with a regular tissue or water sometimes."	&&&
These pink soft sponges are so awesome! First time using it I ran it through water and it became this soft cloud-like fabric that I used to remove my WATERPROOF makeup. It works wonders and even adding a drop of facial cleanser can make it even better. This is so much better than buying makeup remover wipes at the store. I definitely intend to buy more once these babies wear out!	&&&
These wipes have saved me so much time. I use then in the kitchen, common areas and where ever my pets rest their little paws. I highly recommend them.	&&&
With two boys at home there are always bringing in items from outside and dropping them on the counter. the wipes are super easy to use , they clean and disinfect quite quick	&&&
Sorry amazon when it say "sensitive" I assume it doesn't have a scent. Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract may sooth some, but it doesn't in my family. The only reason I gave it a 2 star is because I like the texture of the wipes, but it is really harsh on our bums.	&&&
I highly recommend these wipes, they are so convenient to have in the house! They smell awesome and because its Clorox I know my house is free of germs.	&&&
My family and I love these wipes! :) They are my favorite to clean up messes in the kitchen!	&&&
I keep clorox wipes in every bathroom and in the kitchen. I use them daily to keep germs at bay!	&&&
i love clorox company, espiecialy this product. i love it !	&&&
always have these on hand for when my kids get hit with a virus	&&&
Clorox is great. I like the disinfectant wipes the clorox for stains on sink. I would recommend products to friends.	&&&
I usually love oxo but this missed the mark. Wipes completely dried out. At first I thought it might have been because I left them in for too long so I tried again - all dried out within 1-2 days	&&&
"Love these wipes. They are perfect for baby and to find them at my local staples was an added bonus."	&&&
Easy and convenient way to disinfect my counters and vanities	&&&
If you hate to dust, then these Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes are made just for you. My wife absolutely loves the Clorox Disinfectant Wipes and has been using them for years to clean up spills, washing the sink and toilets, and cleaning up those little messes our cats enjoy making on your carpet. And we've been looking for an equally effective way to take care of dust and cat hairs that tend to pile up on your blinds, furniture and television set. Well, leave it to Clorox to fill that need and do it in the same professional manner as their wipes. These are very handy to grab and clean, pick up dust and hold it well, and do exactly what you need from a dusting product. You can trust the Clorox name to deliver the quality you want and deserve.	&&&
Within a week of using these (and I only did in one instance), I ended up with a UTI. There are other brands out there that I've used and not had an issue. I will go back to one of those in future. The rest of the box has been used to clean toothpaste and soap scum out of the sink.	&&&
I love that these wipes stay nice and soft after lots of washes. They are perfectly sized and very absorbent - I've never needed to use more than 2 wipes on even the most enormous blowout. They do get a little wrinkly in the wash, so I would recommend washing them in a mesh bag with your diapers - we had one get stuck under the drum of our washing machine and it was an ordeal to get it out. Other than that, we have absolutely loved these wipes and I use them daily.	&&&
I absolutely love the makeup remover wipes. The only thing I ever struggled with when having to remove my makeup was REMOVING THE MASCARA and with these makeup remover wipes it comes off like slicing through butter! It also leaves my skin feeling really healthy and clean. I would definitely recommend this product to any MAC fanatic or newbie.	&&&
These wipes are usually used as my on the go wipes or my secondary choice when i cant find my one and done. They are heavy duty enough to help me with the removal of my makeup after a long day and they are gentle enough to not irritate baby when used on his skin. The shea butter doesn't come off as overpowering just gentle enough to leave a nice scent there after. I love these.	&&&
I can only say you have to try them for yourself. I've tried all other wipes but these Luvs wipes are the BEST! I'm a first time mom in my early forties and I must say I am very pleased with this brand. I even use Luvs diapers size 5 and overnight for my baby. My baby has never had any type of allergic reaction from this product despite other brands I've tried. I would HIGHLY recommend this to brand to all moms.	&&&
Not much to say...baby wipes that are all natural, with no chemicals. We've used these on our baby since she was a newborn and never had an issues with rashes or anything.	&&&
I've used all the wipes from the ultra expensive to the store/pharmacy brand cheapo - these wipes are hands down the best and an exceptional value to boot. Thickness is fine and I like the pop up dispenser built in - keep one in the car, both bathrooms at home and in the diaper bag. My son has very sensitive skin and these fragrance free are great - no rash/breakout/sensitivity seen at all! thank you Walmart for a great product at a great price.	&&&
These wipes are great because I use half the wipes as I would need with cheaper brands. They are thick & have a great texture that helps when your changing the yuckiest of diapers. The scent is also very nice & not too overwhelming.	&&&
I love the Huggies Natural Care wipes because they are fragrance free and hypoallergenic. My son has very senitive skin and I didn't want to risk him breaking out from another source. The wipes are very soft but do rip if you're cleaning a heavy load.	&&&
I give these an okay rating because they are great for using on things other than babies! They are just too wet and thin. I don't think you should be able to ring out a wipe! I do use these to remove my makeup, they are great for that!	&&&
Piece of crap! This is the 4th one I've purchased and I just wrote to the company. What in the world is going on with these? I clean them after each use. I use the proper floor cleaner. Just plain cheap.	&&&
I love these wipes I started using them when my son was about 1 yr old these are perfect they get all the snot out and boogies!!!! best thing to little noses the Grape secret is the best	&&&
Best value for this type of gentle wipe. Gentle on their face and nose. Smells great too. Will recommend to others .	&&&
Doesnt like this brand. No clue y"}},	&&&
These wipes work so good. Before, I would just use regular toilet paper to wipe myself. Now, I feel more sophisticated, and more clean and fresh. When you stand up after wiping, you can feel the cool wind on the area you wiped because you used wipes instead of toilet paper. That feeling is addictive.	&&&
It's the best	&&&
These wipes are strong and i dont have to worry about the harsh chemicals that are in regular wipes. I love this brand in general, i use them for diapers and dish soap	&&&
The camera case is nice. Not too bulky but a bit on the small side. It holds my camera well but you can not fit the mini tripod or anything in the case with the camera. So if you want to be able to fit it all in one case you will need to find a bigger one.	&&&
I really loved these wipes! They are soft and smooth, but strong enough to easily wipe my baby clean without my fingers poking through the wipe. They have no off-putting fragrance and I love that they are natural! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
Works just as well as the cheaper wipes I've used	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for a quick clean up. The disinfecting power give you peace of mind that your surfaces are germ free.	&&&
I just had my first baby and I bought pampers wipes sensitive and love the texture. It cleans really well and you don't need to use a lot. I am going to continue buying pampers products as my child grows. Love it, Love it, Love it! !!!	&&&
I love this product. It makes it so easy to clean my kitchen	&&&
We have always used Clorox products and we will always love them!	&&&
As a nurse, I know the importance of keeping things clean and as germ free as possible. I used these techniques at work and in our home. I try to pass this information to my family and friends.	&&&
I love clorox disinfecting wipes. They are super convenient to use and I like knowing that I'm killing all bacteria and viruses in the process. I use them daily and always have them on hand.	&&&
Love these for a quickie fresh up.	&&&
"These are by far the best purchases you can make in these flu and cold months. They help disinfect all common every day items that we use and not realize that are covered in germs. Items like your phone, keyboard, mouse and drawhandles at your office can easily be cleaned. In a household setting there are even more uses for them; from refridgerator and microwave handles to wiping down walls to cleaning up spills, the uses are endless. They also make bathroom clean up a snap. I personally put a container of these Lysol wipes in almost every room of my house."	&&&
I have kids with super sensitive skin and since these came out they're the only wipes I'll use. They are worth the extra money to not hurt your child's skin! !!	&&&
I love these wipes. I know some are saying they are too damp/wet but I think its perfect and makes cleaning explosions much easier lol	&&&
everybody seems to like them. I don't. Hard to get out of the package (package doesn't tear easily at the proper point). My glasses are plastic, and the wipes don't clean them well. I will throw them away!	&&&
Clorox is a staple product in our house we use it on everything!	&&&
Love these wipes. They work great with my daughters sensitive skin. Great value.	&&&
In college I'm a germaphobe. I always keep these on hand! So good smelling and make me feel at peace.	&&&
Wipes work well. They get tough jobs done and clean and sanitize all in one. Great product!	&&&
Love the convenience of these wipes, especially fora quick clean of the bathroom!	&&&
just bought 4 3pks of wipes today they make everything so clean.love em	&&&
These wives word like they should they were gentle and cleaned well. Though after using for hands or face seemed like it left a sort of the sticky residue	&&&
Cleans well and does not leave an offensive smell behind.	&&&
Not much different or better than walmart brand individual wipes. Theres nothing special about these that impress me, they just have fancy packaging	&&&
These are perfect. I'm so happy to have found this huge quantity refill wipes. One section (1/3 of the resealable bag) filled my empty container. The wipes were very moist, which assures me that these are fresh. What's especially nice is how good they clean, yet still gentle on sensitive skin. These arrived 5 days sooner than expected. What a nice surprise. Plus, they were a great price.	&&&
Best wipes ever and they smell great!!	&&&
These are perfect for cleaning lenses. Wow, what a concept. Lense cleaning wipes that are good for cleaning lenses. They are just the right amount of wet for cleaning a camera lens or a couple of eye glasses. It is nice that they are not so wet as the goal is a clean lens, not a wet one. The alcohol cleans the lens and it evaporates quickly. I found no residue or streaks. Actually, if I was being parinoid, I could see streaks but then they dried and were gone. Best to clean the lens, see if it is completely clean, touch up whatever spots are left, and continue that until it is clean. It works great for a tablet and I got a 24 inch monitor mostly clean but I think to really do a monitor would take a couple. But with 400 to play with, what the hell.	&&&
I liked the thickness but there are other wipes that are as nice for less.	&&&
great stuff	&&&
Love Clorox wipes, tried cheaper brands but always come back to Clorox.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes! They are the best and only wipes my family uses!	&&&
We absolutely love Clorox wipes. My husband is taking chemo treatments and he uses them each and every day.	&&&
When I was pregnant I thought friends were crazy for only using pampers wipes because they are more expensive than others, but now I know why. They are the only wipes we use for our daughter. The thickness and quality is worth the extra money. Someone bought us a huge box of another brand as a gift and while we used them we were reminded again and again why we love Pampers Sensitive wipes.	&&&
Does it wipe and does it clean? Yes. I love the fact that a bit of the cleaning solution gets left inside the containers even after all the wipes have been used... letting me make some makeshift wipes with a paper towel! I'm not being thrifty... just when you are desperate!	&&&
I use only Clorox because it's what my Mother always used. There is no other product out there that can compare to ANY Clorox product. That's is all I use on a daily basis.	&&&
I will not use anything but these wipes for disinfecting my bathroom and kitchen surfaces.	&&&
I love the disinfecting wipes. Having a toddler these wipes are very useful.	&&&
"I have used these wipes on my Iphone, laptop, tablet, televisions, and computer monitors. They have surpassed my greatest expectations. I have used other wipes and was disappointed because they left streaks. These wipes dry clean and without streaks. I thought there would be wet spots because there would appear to be moisture left behind but I was wrong. The moisture spots dry without streaks or spots for a brilliant picture.
I have already repeated my purchasing of this item and will purchase them again in the future as needed.""}},"	&&&
Love these I may be ordering more.	&&&
I use these wipes all the time. They are handy to have around to clean up a mess and although they are sometimes very wet they do the job and you can use a napkin to clean up all the wetness that is left over.	&&&
"very handy in the tub - perfect for our office"	&&&
"""good value; use regularly to disinfect door knobs, phones, keyboards, etc.

to kill germs & viruses that are so prevalent with school kids (grandson) & who got sick & then got his parents sick, too. Grandparents used Lysol & did NOT get sick."""	&&&
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. THEY SMELL GREAT AND ITS EASY TO WORK WITH.	&&&
Ugh. My fiance is ADDICTED to these. Hey - whatever promotes the best personal hygiene, right? ;)	&&&
It is a very good product. It takes eveyrthing off around the house including dirty kitchen to bathroom to tubs.	&&&
Great for running and working out. I can go from workout/race to my next event without worry! Light, easy, and awesome!	&&&
Tissue is just big enough with enough saline on it, really like the smell too!	&&&
Thank you Clorox for making great wipes that clean and are super convenient!	&&&
These wipes were easy to us and made lean up very simple.	&&&
I like that these wipes can be used on a variety of surfaces	&&&
very good product, cleans. disinfects, and whitens at the same time!	&&&
Excellent wipes, without all the nasty chemicals. They are a little thin, but that doesn't bother me. They don't really have a scent. I think this is an excellent deal for these "safer" wipes, they are priced competitively. If you haven't signed up for amazon mom, and subscribe and save, I urge you to do it now!	&&&
I love using clorox wipes, its easy and convenient to use.	&&&
Clorox wipes is a number cleaner in my house hold.	&&&
Awesome wipes. Safe for newborns to elderly frail skin. My fiancé has extremely bad eczema and can't use anything with fragrance/soap on his skin. He has no problem using these after the gym or on the run. I couldn't be happier with the softness/dampens/cost of these wipes.	&&&
With 4 kids I need fast cleaning solutions that work...Clorox wipes are perfect!	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use anywhere. With this long winter we are having, I feel using the Clorox wipes in our bathrooms and kitchen are killing those germs. I love the lemon scent.	&&&
With three busy body boys these wipes come in handy. I used them on everything, because we all know boys will be boys. These wipes leave everything clean and smelling good.	&&&
"We've tried a bunch of baby wipes in the past two years or so, and nothing beats Huggies Simply Clean. For one thing, the name is pretty accurate--they are simple, and they clean.

They're simple in the sense that they don't have a lot of ingredients. That's much better for our son's skin. So far, the formulation has been gentle enough to not aggravate rashes, etc.

And they clean. We find these wipes to be thicker than most, and they stay wetter than most. I still use more than I really need to with each use--because I'm thinking the more layers of wipe between me and what I'm cleaning, the better!--but really, one is probably enough to do the trick.

So--we're big fans of Huggies Simply Clean Baby Wipes. Buying by the bulk--especially with Amazon Mom/Amazon Prime--saves some $$, too."	&&&
"I LOVE this product! We received one as a gift when I was pregnant and looking back it was hands down one of my favorite baby items. I now give one to all expecting moms as a baby shower gift, it's that important lol. Seriously though, this thing just works. It has the weight that holds the wipes down so you only get one at a time, it keeps the wipes moist until the last one, it looks nice sitting on a dresser or changing table. If you're having a baby you need one of these!"	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. They're so convenient. Instead of getting a cloth, applying water, applying soap, wringing it out, wiping down the counter, rinsing the counter...all I have to do is pop the lid, pull out a wipe and wipe the area. Then I'm done!	&&&
This product is great. The wipes are just the right temperature and not cold once you take them out of the unit. You do have to allow it to heat up before using the wipes if you want them to be warm and not cold. The instructions are very easy to follow. Highly recommend it if you wish to use warm wipes on your baby	&&&
i use these wipes for every cleaning day i have--love the convienence and easy use	&&&
It helps get stains out. Smells good. Would recommend it.	&&&
I love using these Clorox wipes - I travel a lot & always keep these handy. I want to feel comfy in my hotel room & these wipes always help with cleaning when I'm in a hotel.	&&&
I use Clorox disinfecting wipes all the time with kids running around all day. They come in very handy.	&&&
GREAT! They really do clean glass without leaving any streaks. I also use them on countertops. I like how the wipes are really wet when you pull them out. Some people might not like that but I love it beacuse onr wipe goes a long way. I have had other wipes before that were barley damp and it ended up being a big waste since I had to use so many to get the job done.	&&&
"It does a great job of keeping wipes warm without drying them out. But I have a hard time pulling the wipes out without tearing them."	&&&
I love these wipes. I have a 20 month old and with his many adventures with food and other objects that can cause a mess, the wipes are very handy	&&&
They're awesome! They really give a deep clean to my counters and other surfaces.	&&&
I always use Clorox wipes during Flu Season. It works so convenient and easy to use. Thanks Clorox.	&&&
2 kids 6 and 8. 2 BIG dogs. I am always cleaning!!!! I love how these are so handy to just wipe away the dirt! They are even safe for my kids to use. Look up on pinterest for craft ideas.	&&&
i like how easy i can wipe my laptop keyboard and my desk.	&&&
"The wipes are thin and soft. They come in a box that dispenses them like facial tissues.

These are great for dry dusting. They pick up dust, crumbs, and even glitter well, leaving surfaces looking clean. I did the majority of my dusting with just one wipe. (That included a desk, a printer, a monitor, a television, two television consoles, and a dresser.) The only shine they leave behind is whatever is natural to the wood or item that you’re dusting. Still, I was very happy with the results. With 54 wipes in the box, these will probably last me a very long time.

5 STARS: They’re very effective and especially useful for cleaning electronics. These are great for a quick and convenient cleaning."	&&&
"First, let me say that 2 boxes of 64 wipes is a lot of wipes. Thankfully, they are great wipes so having a lot on hand is a good thing.

I'm a slacker when it comes to dusting. We have a small group of animals that live in the house with us, so we make a lot of ""dust"". These cloths seem to attract it - a light swipe over an area where there are several small items to be picked up does a fair job - all on its own. The cloth is textured to hold onto small particles. They don't have a smell to them, really. They remind me of dryer sheets, but different. They are packaged like Kleenex with the box making a dispenser.

Each cloth will hold an amazing amount of dust particles. You may need one or two for ceiling fan blades and window blinds.

It's nice to start with 2 boxes because you can store them at different ends of your cleaning routine."	&&&
Great for quick clean up and easy for younger ones to use.	&&&
This is GREAT when your kid has a cold! It's soft and doesn't hurt their nose. Smells good too!!	&&&
These are our favorite kind of wipes. They are very soft and strong. We use less of these wipes then when we try and buy the bargain brand so they are really worth the value.we have a subscription to these wipes and we get them every month in the mail, we've been using them for the past eight months and we are very happy with them.	&&&
Love the products! The Bleach for obvious reasons. I use the blue toilet bowl cleaner because I just pour it in, leave it for 5 min and then flush and I don't have to scrub a thing! I love the disinfecting wipes(non bleach) to disinfect the bathroom surfaces weekly as well as kitchen counters after cooking meats and if child vomits anywhere. The scent is fantastic at it covers up the vomit smell.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes it makes me feel like things are clean, they look and smell clean and the germs are gone	&&&
these are the best and best price too, bottom line is: they do the dirty job, and keep the bottoms smelling as fresh as flowers .	&&&
Tried it by accident when I dropped some nail polish in the store. It didn't spill on the floor, but got on my clothing. I turned around and opened a pack of these to clean up the mess. Took the rest home and tried them. I love them! They make my skin feel so soft and the smell is GREAT! I also love their shave cream. Come to think of it, I might need to look into some of their other products."}	&&&
Pampers wipes are far better then other wipes and thus you end up using less of them.	&&&
I really like these wipes! They are thick and strong and great for the members of our family with sensitive skin. So glad to be using wholesome products! I received a free sample in return for my honest opinion.	&&&
The wipes had a nice smell and cleaned well.	&&&
I love these wipes. My face felt so clean and very smooth the next morning."}	&&&
The wipes are great! I use them for small messes and to keep the house clean .	&&&
Great product for lazy family members who will not clean up a mess if they have to drag out paper towels or cleaning cloths. These people will actually use the wipes.	&&&
I love having the use of the wipes along with having the solution.	&&&
I really love this product, and never waver the thought of purchasing another brand.	&&&
Easy and convenient wipes are perfect for every cleaning need!	&&&
Love these wipes. So soft and free of nasty chemicals. They come dry so you just moisten them with water or a solution of your choice and use. I have a spray bottle that I carry with the wipes. Will buy again.	&&&
I am really disappointed as I was just pulling out a pack of wipes from the box and I saw a large cut down the side of the wipes, from where someone must have used a knife to cut open a box in a warehouse. The wipes are dry and unusable, however I am unable to return it to Amazon as it is past the time limit for a return. I am hoping Water Wipes will send me a new pack in replacement.	&&&
I can never have to many clorox wipes on hand for my families needs.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes!!!! They are the reason we avoid the flu :)	&&&
Love the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes! So convenient to use and I know that I am getting rid of all the germs. Use them at least once a week on door handles and etc. Everyday use for counter.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes. They are easy to use and convenient.	&&&
"We use them all the time. Great for kids and adults. Especially during allergy season."	&&&
I use Clorox wipes for everything! They are easy to pull out of the container and they clean really well. I have a four year old son and he gets toothpaste all over our bathroom sink. Clorox wipes make it so easy to clean up after him! I use them in the bathroom, kitchen, and on our floors to clean up and dirt.	&&&
This product is great for parents who need to take care of little messes on the fly. Spilled milk, apple juice and who knows what can be easily cleaned up when you need to disinfect now So you can get back to the fun of parenting.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes, I have a canister in the kitchen and one in the bathroom, Makes clean up of messes much easier. You don't have to clean up after the clean up!	&&&
"I have 3 boys who are past the baby stage, but definitely still get messy! The amount of baby wipes we've been going through,even though there older is crazy.
Buying these re-usable cloth wipes has been a god send.
I only wish I'd come across this product when they were babies."	&&&
I am loving the new Huggies Clutch \u2018n\u2019 Clean* wipes they are natural care wipes that are in a stylish clutch, that you can carry around in your diaper bag and easily refill them.	&&&
The tencel fiber is great because it is durable. No tears which means your hands stay clean. The wipes do stick together often which means you will get two wipes when you only need one.	&&&
Amazing wipes, thick and absorbent. I look forward to cleaning poos because these work so well...way better than terry cloth or disposable wipes!	&&&
rarely have diaper rash issues with these wipes and the sensitve swaddler diapers. The wipes are the best for thickness and quality. I don't like the Pampers pop-up container; the Huggies container is the best, their wipes no way.	&&&
love thew product and always will us it because its awesome thank you	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because they are convenient and easy to use. I use them all the time, but especially during cold and flu season to stop the spread of germs.	&&&
Clorox wipes are so convenient and easy to use. I love to use them to clean kitchen counters after cooking.	&&&
Pampers wipes are great! And the travel pack is convenient for keeping in the car and in the diaper bag. The plastic helps keep the wipes moist.	&&&
For me I think all wipes are created equally. Clorox wipes are good but I get have the same from a cheaper product or store brand.	&&&
Best wipes around for active toddlers who are always getting into something or making a mess. These are also great period for kids and adults to keep your hands as free from germs as possible when not able to get to a sink right away. These are great quality and do a great job of keeping my grandson's hands clean. They are also great for wiping off tables and other areas that need to be cleaned thoroughly and quickly. The container is very convenient in size..These wipes I can't do without and would definitely recommend .	&&&
I love to wipe my counters with Clorox wipes and the lemon scent cleans my kitchen just the way I like. I totally recommend the Clorox wipes.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes on everything but the floor and glass in my bathroom. Use it for all my coutertop surfaces too!	&&&
The only brand I use to clean my kitchen and bathrooms!!!!	&&&

I love the disinfecting wipes because they are easy to use and great for quick clean ups around the house.	&&&
These are great for personal hygiene. Very refreshing; but I do not recommend flushing if you have a septic system.	&&&
Love seventh generation wipes! Good quality and I love that they are all natural. Would definitely recommend them to family and friends	&&&
I recieved my wipe samples free of charge today used one. There thick and smell nice. They dont leave anything behind like other wipes. I like them and recommend them	&&&

I love these wipes !!!! Very convient and easy to use	&&&
EASY TO USE WIPES, GET THE JOB DONE. I USE IT ON MY COUNTER TOP AT HOME AND IN THE BATHROOM TO DISINFECT.	&&&
I love the sensitive wipes. They don't break like other brands do and it has a gentle feel and soft scent. I always use this kind even when they are toddlers!!!	&&&
I prefer the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the Green bottle, but these are a close second. The green seem to clean better and the odor isn't overpowering like the Lemon scented.	&&&
These wipes are definitely multipurpose I have been using them to clean my hands since I do work with children and to clean theirs. The boxes small it's a nice size and want to take up too much space. They smell quite nice and they are perfectly thick. I was given these wipes at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I definitely recommend this product to everyone because you can use it in multiple ways.	&&&
Perfect for college apartments, when you don't exactly know what your roommate sorta cleaned up	&&&
I use Clorox wipes constantly! Great for cleaning up my child's messes and killing germs!!	&&&
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this product. I thought it would be just like a baby wipe. It cleaned my baby's nose out so much better. Even if he had dried boogies, it got them out with ease. I would totally buy them again. Most likely the unscented just because they go in his nose. It would be an excellent product for parents who have children with constant runny noses."	&&&
I love using all of the Clorox brand items. They make cleaning fast and easy.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes, We use them on everything in our house.	&&&
I absolutely love lysol products. They are perfect for my kid household	&&&
The wipes are so convenient! I keep them on my kitchen counter for quick sanitizing. I love the fact that they are easy to pull out as well as the trusted Clorox name. Amazing!	&&&
So convenient and easy to use. I love keeping these in my bathroom	&&&
I love the 303 Aeropspace Cleaner to clean out my car. However, the spray product is a much better bet than these wipes. When using a spray bottle, you can spray directly on the plastic or onto a rag. This allows you to reach all of the corners and spread the product in an even fashion. These wipes are too concentrated and and if miss even a sliver of plastic it is easy to see. I will continue to use 303 cleaning products, but I will be purchasing the spray instead of the wipes.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes when I'm in a rush. They are great and easy to use when I'm in a hurry and don't have time to break out the spray bottle and sponge.	&&&
I love using disinfecting clorox wipes!!! They are easy to use and I know my surfaces are clean..	&&&
Cold and flu season requires I keep Clorox wipes around. I have made it through the past three seasons without getting sick. That makes them a bargain at any price.	&&&
I love using Clorox wipes and sprays and my kids don't mind helping because the wipes are so convenient.	&&&
I use the wipes to clean everything. Fast easy clean up. These are the only wipes I will use.	&&&
I love this product because it makes disinfecting my house easy!	&&&

these things are great. they are perfect for our stainless steel fridge doors. and the price from staples was cheaper than anywhere else. win win."}},	&&&
I use these wipes all over my kitchen. Easy to use and i love that they disinfect	&&&
I've tried other makeup remover wipes and they made me breakout. This one does not! Smells clean. Easy to use. Love it.	&&&
I think the wipes are the easiest and quickest way to clean all areas of the home	&&&
I love using clorox wipes because it quick easy and it has a power stain cleaning with fresh lemon scent . It works very good in the kitchen when cooking and cutting up different foods . The smell goes away and you know all bacteria has been clean .	&&&
They are not all chemical free, but I feel that they do a good job cleaning. I've tried natural wipes that I feel that don't clean at all or that are too dry. This wipes are moist and do there job for the price.	&&&
We used these wipes with both of our kids, when they were wearing diapers, and they worked well, sometimes they got a little stuck together and that made it hard while trying to change a poopy diaper but overall they were good. We liked how thick they were and that they didn't leave a rash. We still use the wipes now, and my daughter is potty trained and my son is currently training. We use them to wipe hands and face and clean up little messes in the car on their car seats. They are good to use for other things as well as changing diapers.	&&&
These Clorox wipes are convenient, easy to use, cleans up any mess and smells great	&&&
We love to use these wipes to clean everything! They smell so good!!	&&&
Though I don't have a tot, ever since I heard a dr on a radio show extoll the virtues of baby wipes for various things (camping trips, long drives, less than sanitary exposures) I have kept a stash on hand. This clean, sleek container allows me to keep them on hand without having to explain why I have baby wipes and no baby :) works great, easy to use and the wipes stay moist.	&&&
I used these for a while with no issues and then my baby broke out into a rash. I had been using the wipes before so I did not suspect the wipes at first. I go though about 9-15 diapers a day so it wasn't that I wasn't changing her. I tried changing her food, cloth diapering, creams...the works. The rashes were so bad that her skin would break and no matter what I did I could not get her skin to heal. One day I wiped her face with one of the wipes and her face broke out into hives. I decided to try a different brand with some pronounceable ingredients on the back and her skin completely cleared up after using the first pack and she has never had a problem since. I don't believe these are natural like they advertise. They don't use perfumes but they have formaldehyde scent and I think at least half of the ingredients on the back on concocted in a lab and were never meant to be put on a baby's skin.	&&&
great makeup removing wipes. makes my skin feel soft	&&&
The ability to just wipe, discard, and go for a busy mom is such a time saver. Cleaning and disinfecting is very important to parents and Clorox wipes make this happen with ease and doesn't bust the budget. Clorox wipes have so many uses and the clean lemon smell makes it pleasant to use.	&&&
I love their clorox wipes. It disinfects and they smell good	&&&
I love cleaning with Clorox wipes because it makes my job easier and faster.	&&&
I rescue small dogs, so they come in very handy when cleaning up their messes and disinfects at the same time, I would love to have a huge stock of them	&&&
I clean house and take care of two pre-school boys for a living. Clorox wipes (as well as the toilet wand!) are my go-to for disinfecting the bathroom. What a great way to keep my little charges germ-free!	&&&
Clorox wipes get the job done and the lemon scent leaves a fresh clean smell. I recommend this product to everyone!	&&&
Yes this a good product, I have used many others and this the only one that does not dry MY sensitive skin. Some of the others really dry out my hands and I need to use lotion as often as the wipe.	&&&
"no weird scent, no weird chemicals, seems to work great, the pack size is good - the size of the wipe is good and so is the thickness.
not thin, not too big or too small, and I don't feel like I have to wash the smell of them off my hands"	&&&
"I've always used Earth's Best wipes but I couldn't turn down the price of the huggies natural care wipes. I was seriously skeptical considering the price, but the wipes are very good! They are more of a cloth like wipe instead of your standard wipes which I liked ... it also didn't tear apart if I tried to tug at a particularly ""stuck"" wipe in the wipe container. Also, they are moist, but not wet. Which I appreciate since wet wipes are more of a nuisance than anything since it makes my kid cold.

It comes with 3 gigantic resealable bag of wipes + a wipe container. I have a OXO container so I didn't need the wipe container. I keep that container in the car with a secret stash of toys to keep my kid entertained instead. Since each bag was so big, I was concerned that they might dry out before I got a chance to use the whole bag, but no ... it's been good down to the last wipe of the bunch.

I now order the Earths Best for daycare (since they come in individual packages making it easier to supply for daycare) but I use these at home."	&&&
I bought 2 packages of these when I accidentally left the house without our regular wipes - oops! While the wipes are soft and didn't tear under pressure, my daughter and I both found the scent completely distasteful. In addition, they weren't very large. Because of all these factors, I won't be re-purchasing unless in a pinch.	&&&
These are the best -- have used for a while now. always wondered WHY they only sold as 700...wasted space in a box clearly made for 800...	&&&
I bought these washcloths because I was recently diagnosed with rosacea. I wanted a soft washcloth that wouldn't irritate my skin any further and these caught my eye. They are very soft and durable - just right for washing my face without any irritation! I'll recommend these for sure!	&&&
"Wife uses these and swears by them. Tried them once and now I can't let her run out or she's unhappy."	&&&
It's a good case but the tripod seems kind of useless.	&&&
These boogie wipes does wonders for my toddler! At first I would wipe her boogies with tissue paper which Irritated her nose. Then I found these boogie wipes. The saline in them makes it easy on both of us to wipe her nose and get boogies out and no irritation.	&&&
"These wipes are nice and thick, but not so think they get caught up coming out of the package. I use these in their original package for the diaper bag, in the car, etc and also in a larger Huggies dispenser in the nursery.

A problem I run into with other wipes is that they either come out too easily, and you waste a wipe or have to stuff it back in, or they get stuck coming out of the package - much worse, when you have a squirmy baby and a messy diaper!

I like that these wipes have minimal ingredients, so I'm not putting unnecessary products on babes skin. There is really no scent, maybe a tiny bit like aloe vera.

Good price, super fast delivery."	&&&
These are very durable and do the job, but are very rough and too dry to really enjoy the softness that should be there. Have added my own essential oils to make them softer and more moist.	&&&
I absolutely love these! They're so soft and I don't think we've had any stains. They also have shown very minimal wear/fraying.	&&&
don't use on lens. streaks to high hell.	&&&
We have been looking for a product like this for a while. I think it is wonderful just to sit by the c-pap machine so that you can take wipe and of the container and clean mask jus before using the mask. Fast and easy!!!	&&&
Didn't really notice a difference in this compared to other wipes	&&&
Best value wipes out there, way stronger and better than huggies. Only thing that comes close in my opinion is the kirkland brand from costco but those are more expensive and only come in one very large case with fewer options to buy down just a few.	&&&
I love this product! Very easy to clean counter tops.	&&&
Works great when you're not feeling well. Quick and easy!	&&&
I trust Clorox products and use them all over my house.	&&&
"My 9 month old was sick for the first time and his nose was very difficult to deal with. Boogie wipes are the only wipe I used. They would moisten his boogies up and not leave raw skin behind. Very gentle."	&&&
The wipes are easy to use and keeps the place clean.	&&&
Our family loves the disinfecting wipes and use them frequently. Makes for quick cleanup when guests arrive unexpectedly. Just wipe down the basin and the bowl and you're good to go. The wipes have a pleasing scent as well. Perfect.	&&&
THE CLOROX PRODUCTS FRESHENER AND MAKE THE CLOTHES AND COUNTERTOPS CLEAN	&&&
We used these wipes on my son when he was a NB because he has very sensitive skin. The fact that it had a little lotion in the wipes helped sooth his skin. The scent was very mild but smelled really good.	&&&
I've been using Clorox for years, it's a great product, and I use it to get most of my toughest stains out. My favorite part is they don't fall apart when I'm using them like some wipes do.	&&&
I love using the Clorox wipes to clean my kitchen and bathroom. Having a 4yr old and a 9mo old, they are easy and convenient to use. Thanks Clorox :)	&&&
I could not even begin to clean my house if I didn't have my Clorox wipes. They make cleaning so easy and smell so good.	&&&
Love using the products all around the house, disinfect my work desk, car. etc.	&&&
Love these wipes! Everything smells and looks so clean after using them.	&&&
Better than any other cleaning wipes! I know that I am actually cleaning with Clorox wipes!	&&&
This is a very good product, Smells nice and wipes well. I would definitely buy again and recommend to people around me.	&&&
Haven't used them yet, but they look like they will work great, not only on silver, but other mediums like gold and brass.	&&&
excelente excelente excelente kill bacterias good for my family and school too	&&&
i am a very frugal consumer, but with young kids, disinfecting wipes are a must for me. It makes cleaning and disinfecting so much easier and faster	&&&
Wipes are convenient. I have them handy in my bathroom and kitchen. My husband buys them like crazy!!! Great product!	&&&
Great product. I use clorox wipes daily to wipe down counters & spray my shower.	&&&
Nice scent!	&&&
Tablets are smaller than expected, but open up to full size wipes. Love them. Very easy to carry several in my purse and backpacking. Am buying more for emergency supplies.	&&&
These are the only wipes that do not irritate my son. All the other wipes really leave him dry and irritated these seem to leave him better moisturized.	&&&
I use clorox wipes on everything, from kitchen to car to bathroom. makes clean up so easy	&&&
Great wipes. Though I usually prefer buying the store brand since they are kind of pricey. Specially for those that use them very often.	&&&
I recently used the Lemon Kitchen wipes, and they cleaned hard grease areas just like that. I'm sold now!!!	&&&
"I really love the wipes they smell good and are so convinent. I
Love it."	&&&
Made my mask smell very strange after just a couple uses. I don't trust this product.	&&&
Amazing value.	&&&
I bought a pak of these wipes and they were very dry. very disappointed.	&&&
The Clorox disinfecting wipes provides excellence in cleaning your home or office.	&&&
I LOVE clorox wipes, they are so easy to use and much more sanitary than a towel!	&&&
Love these wipes! Use in the bathroom and kitchen.	&&&
I absolutely love clorox products! Some of my favorites are the bleach all purpose cleaner because it kills germs and is easy to use, but doesn't leave the horrible "bleach" smell that a lot of bleach cleaners typically do. The wipes are also one of my favorites. They are so easy to use! I use them everywhere-- from the ktichen and bathroom, to my car and exercise equipment (to disinfect after use).	&&&
I started doing the Fly Lady cleaning routine, and these wipes are awesome for bathroom cleaning!	&&&
love this product and its a must buy in every home.	&&&
I like Clorox wipes because they are easy and quick to use...	&&&
"We like most Seventh Generation products, and these wipes are no exception. They are quite soft, have limited ingredients, and they usually do the job well. I think what we like the most, though, is that the simple ingredients make it less likely that a baby's skin will respond unfavorably to their use. So far, we've had no rashes, irritations, etc. when using these wipes.

They don't seem to be quite as thick as some other brands, but still, they almost always get the job done with little mess."	&&&
"When iI opened the box, I had very low expectations. Instead of being fuzzy like swiffer wipes, these look and feel like a stiffer (and smaller) version of Handi-wipes, those semi-disposable perforated nonwoven striped dishcloth thingies that have been around forever (are also a clorox product). To give an idea of volume, 54 ct of this product about 30% larger than 16 count box of swiffer.

On sight, I didn't expect much--they look and feel like rough paper towels but they do a really good job at dry dusting! They work at least as well as swiffer at holding onto dirt and dust. And they seem to have less of a problem with big clumps of dust falling off when I let the towel get overloaded. The claim on the box that you can just a whole room with the single life seems a bit overblown unless your room is a heck of a lot cleaner than mine. But all in all, a good and economical disposable dry dusting option.

(Sidenote: a washable rag is my preference for everday cleaning, but sometimes I let dusting go so long that it's pretty thick. Then I'd just as soon use something I can throw away.)"	&&&
These are suppose to be unscented but smell horrible. I am going to call to see if something is wrong with these wipes. We have used pampers wipes for over 2 years and have never had the wipes smell like this. I threw out a box thinking it was just a bad box but our new box smells the same.	&&&
i like the product, it does a great job disinfecting my home.	&&&
"This winter is worst than most for me as far as being pale and pasty white goes. This is for 2 reasons. #1: it is winter – so obviously I can’t be outside tanning. Sure I could go to a tanning bed but would prefer not to. #2: I had two tattoos this summer so the sun was completely out of the picture for me! Normally if I do get tan, it will last a long time for me, but I have nothing to go on and carry me over even the slightest bit from the summer. When I was given the opportunity to review these Glow 2 Go Sunless Tanning Wipes I thought it would be the perfect way to get some color on this pasty white skin of mine!
I was impressed with the idea of using a WIPE instead of trying to put typical sunless tanning lotion on because I always end up with streaks when I do so. I thought the idea of the wipe would help with making the tan even, and I was correct. To be honest though – my first attempt was still a bit streaky on my legs, but overall it was worlds ahead of typical sunless tanning lotion. If you have ever used sunless tanning lotion before you know that areas like the knees, elbows, and ankles tend to soak in more and the color turns out darker. That was not the case with these at all. Nor did it leave the palms of my hands colored orange either, which also seems to happen with sunless tanning lotion.
The scent was awesome. I don’t know if it is just me but I cannot stand the smell of sunless tanners. Even going to a salon and having an airbrush tan, I do not like the smell. I was pleasantly surprised that these did not have that normal, horrible smell to them. They are a very lightly, pleasantly scented wipe!
It only took about 4 hours for me to see the result and it was really a beautiful tan color. There was no orange color to it – just a really nice tan. The streaks I had the first time were my own fault – and the second time I used them it was a very even color. I think they are a really great way to do sunless tanning at home and I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get a beautiful, natural looking tan!"	&&&
"they work really well after you finally get them out of the container. that is no small feat."	&&&
Easy to use, keep one in every bathroom and one in the kitchen.	&&&
The Clorox wipes are used daily in my granddaughters classroom.Love that we can cut down on the germs being spread.	&&&
Can not live with them!!! Life is so easy with these by my side!!!	&&&
Huggies wipes are my favorite. I find the texture to be pleasant and the most cloth-like and they are the most "wet" of all wipes that I've found.	&&&
Like the option of having unscented wipes. Pampers wipes are much better than other brands.	&&&
I can't keep y wipes from drying out when using this, not impressed. As our pamper sensitive wipes are not cheap.	&&&
Best wipes on the market. Great to keep a bottle at your office, in your car and of course at home.	&&&
i love this product, i use this all the time to clean in all areas and i love the smells of it	&&&
Absolutely love Clorox wipes! So easy to grab and wipe down the kitchen after cleaning! Love to disinfect the entire area after having raw meat in the kitchen!	&&&
"The wipe smell bad. I love the unscented ones."	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes because they are so convenient and easy to use.	&&&
Great to have around the house. I have some in the kitchen to wipe down counters and stovetop, and in the bathroom for quick cleanups.	&&&
great for in between baths	&&&
These are the only wipes I use. My little girl was sensitive to wipes with alcohol. These are alcohol free and work great. I use them all the time to wash her face and hands. No chapping or sensitivity at all! An excellent product. The large bags are great to refill dispensers and the new soft packs.	&&&
I bought the green tea scent and I like the wipes. It is a very distinct but mild scent. I can smell it on the wipes, but it doesn't leave an odor on my dog. I'm not sure the cleaning strength is as good as I hoped, as I am having to use them at least daily.	&&&
These work great and have a great smell without smelling too much like chemicals.	&&&
I used this wipes together with my wipes warmer and they wear great didn't dry out and were soft and warm on my baby skin.	&&&
I HATE these wipes. I bought these because another brand I love was out, so I decided to try these. I don't have sensitive skin, but my face felt like it was on fire and burning. It didn't even remove all of my makeup and my skin still did not feel cleansed. I'm returning these and I honestly would save your money.	&&&
This is the product you need to purchase if you are camping or if you are hurt and cannot take showers daily. It smells good and the wipes are larger size.	&&&
Clorox wipes are the very best they can be! I love how convienent they are!	&&&
Good for adult usuage - better than what is availalble - soft and does not have that offensive chemical sweet odor.	&&&
These wipes are so handy, they smell great too! Leaving my kitchen clean!	&&&
When it is cough and cold season I can always count on Clorox disinfecting wipes to cut down on my kids spreading germs around on the surface of my counters and door knobs by using the Clorox wipes.	&&&
I'm a religious Clorox wipe user. I've tried other brands/store brands and I ALWAYS come back to Clorox. I feel they clean and disinfect better than any others!	&&&
Love having Clorox wipes around especially with having 3 boys my kitchen and bathroom are always such a mess. Cleans great	&&&
"Easy when you are on the go!"	&&&
The wipes are stronger than others I have used before which for me means I am able to use them for both a quick wipe and on tougher clean up jobs. I love all of the scents and these are my go to wipes! I have a container in each bathroom and of course in the kitchen and they are my go to product for in between deep cleans.	&&&
The Disinfecting wipes are easy to use, convenient, and are handy for killing germs on door handles, toilet flush, remote controls and light switches. I keep them on handy for keeping down germs.	&&&
great product love this product to help keep my home clean for my 5 children	&&&
Overall of the wipe is just OK. This price with the number of wipes are unbeatable. However, the wipes are a little thin and smells are a little strong. I have to use 5 to 7 wipes to get the job done compared to the pampers sensitive wipes, I only use 3 to 4 wipes the most.	&&&
I have tried several different products for cleaning my glasses, and this has been the best so far. It usually doesn't leave streaks, it cleans well, and it is convenient because you can easily carry one or two wipes around with you (easier than products that require a bottle of cleaning solution). I also use these to clean my cell phone screen, which it works equally well for. I have bought this same product several times now and will continue to buy it in the future (although a box of 200 does last a while).	&&&
When I ordered this product, I thought it was a one-time purchase. It wasn't clear to me that this was a subscription-type order until another large package arrived at my home that I didn't need or want!	&&&
we have a four month old little girl and we have been using these wipes since we brought her home. she has super sensitive skin and these wipes are gentle enough for her most sensitive areas but sturdy enough to get her clean and keep us clean, too! we find ourselves using fewer wipes because they are thick enough to get the job done and less cream because she doesn't get much irritation with these. they've been keeping her clean and comfortable, so we are hooked!	&&&
The title says it all. Tried countless green brands before this one. LOVE it and would recommend to anyone, sensitive skin or not. Based on ingredients, I can also use this to wipe down her hands and mouth after feedings.	&&&
we keep these at the table in the bedroom in the car good for the little messes around when you have little ones the car is the best use of them my 2 year old know how to get them out herself when she makes her mess in the car they are much more durable than others.	&&&
The warmer we got hardly warms the wipes even on the high setting. I'm pretty disappointed as I know my baby would really like warm wipes!	&&&
These are perfect and the only wipes I use. They clean up everything very very well!	&&&
Doesn't seem to be any better than some of the other wipes we have used.	&&&
Bought these in 2013 and again last month, obvious deterioration in quality. 2013 ones were thicker tissue, with more cleaning solution. Recent ones are noticeably thinner and dryer. They still perform adequately for cleaning my glasses.	&&&
Container was bent up and leaking when I opened the box.	&&&
I got these because I thought they might be similar to the Ole ones but they were really rough on my skin and felt like I was rubbing sand paper all over.	&&&
It does a great job of keeping wipes warm without drying them out. But I have a hard time pulling the wipes out without tearing them.	&&&
I love the orange scent the best of all the Clorox wipes scent. I use it mostly in my kitchen on my countertops.	&&&
"It is gentle on the nose, and soft and it does the job right"	&&&
I love using these wipes, they are very conveinient for wiping the counters and table and appliances down.	&&&
SO, I work for a production company and travel a lot. I set large events including lights, sound and video for corporate events nationally. needless to say our days sometimes go 20 hours straight. While the work is tough, going form sweaty to dry to sweaty multiple times wreaks havoc on your....well.......between the cheeks. We call it "gig butt". You get chaffed and raw. Not only do I use one if I have to use the restroom, but if we unload a truck and I get sweaty, before I dry out from slowing down, I head to the restroom and use one of these. NO burning or anything, just cool and almost leaves you feeling like you just used powder once it dries. I put one in my jeans pocket when I head out of my hotel room to the load in for the show and if need be, grab another in the afternoon. I highly recommend these for any guys that do construction or any kind of job where you get sweaty and then dry out and and often get chaffed. NOONE looks cool doing the "duck walk" because your ass is so chaffed it feel like sandpaper rubbing together. These take care of it!!	&&&
Use this products in every room in my house. Clean and disinfected. LOVE them	&&&
This is a very good wipe. It leaves you feeling really clean. The reason I gave four stars is that using it as a refill in the stand up dispenser the wipes do not dispense correctly. They tear and stop dispensing after a few wipes. Maybe you could come out with a better dispenser. I do like them really well though. Thanks	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are great for spot cleaning and cleaning up after small children.	&&&
I love the convince of the Clorox wipes. It allows me to easily disinfect the hard surfaces of my home.	&&&
I only use Clorox wipes on my counters. We use them before and after cooking a meal.	&&&
I used to use a different brand of wipes, usually a cheaper brand but after I started using Huggies, I never use any other brand. I Love the way they clean my baby and keep him clean. I don't have to use as many wipes and they come in so many different varieties. I find Huggies is appropriately priced and I like that my son enjoys the way they feel. I feel a lot better now that I use Huggies brand. I would recommend Huggies wipes to family and friends, and even those of you out there who are thinking about trying them!	&&&
cant never go wrong with Clorox my fave to disinfect and clean and use all over the house	&&&
I love Clorox products. Clorox wipes are handy to use all of the house especially during cold and flu season.	&&&
I don't like the smell----but these wipes are awesome. I think the smell is from there being no fragrance----as many other wipes are.	&&&
I use this wipes about 10 xs a week I just them after every meal to wipe down counter tops and kitchen table the stove and I also use them in the bathroom for the toilet and counter tops as there as well!!! Great product!	&&&
I love these wipes! Every time I use them I feel like I am cleaning efficiently.	&&&
Useing these wipes has inproved our health as well as keeping down any Viruses that may come along"}},	&&&
Happy to have a product that safely disinfects without chemicals! Don't know why people complain about the scent; to me it totally smells lemon-y, mixed with a little bit of the thyme smell. The scent is very clean and fresh! It does not linger, either - so even if you didn't like it, it dissipates rather quickly (in as little as 10 mins in most cases). One amazing thing about these wipes that I have found, in my experience, is that they REALLY cut through sticky messes on counter and stove tops! I barely have to put in any effort and the sticky mess seems to "dissolve" or break down in front of my eyes, and wipes away so easily! I love using these in the kitchen, they make for a quick clean-up!	&&&
aweeesooome i love it it smells good and cleans.. i would recommend it. to anyone	&&&
everyone in our family uses and likes Zeiss eye glass cleaners. no streaks, no drips, no smearing. compact little packets so easy carry in purse or pocket.	&&&
Clorox Wipes are my go-to when it comes to everyday cleaning in my kitchen, bathroom, and living room. I feel confident in their cleaning power, particularly on my kitchen countertops. They're incredibly easy to use and I'm very pleased with them.	&&&
How love how quick and easy Clorax wipes make cleanup! They are particularly great when I am cleaning up after handling raw meat. I know that my food prep surfaces are safe.	&&&
they are wonderful on cleaning up messes. i think they do a great job on disaffecting.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are great for my toddler and myself during the cold and flu season because they don't dry out our noses and are soft to touch after many uses.	&&&
"I have been using Boogie Wipes since my 8 year old was an infant and now I'm using them for my 14 month old. Not only are these wipes effective, the grape scent smells great! I think my 14 month old loves them too because he actually sits still whenever I clean his nose with them."	&&&
I love Josie Maran products. This is probably my 3rd time buying these wipes. Great to keep in my gym bag for post workout. Very gentle and effective cleansing cloths. No junk in them & purchases support furry friends. What's not to love? Will continue to buy.	&&&
This product is great! If I use it too long though, my hands start to burn.	&&&
I have used this product for several years now. I love being able to grab and go with each sheet. I love the clean smell they leave behind. My counter tops shine, faucets gleam, and I even use them to wipe up the car interior. I use them all over my home. Thank you for a consistent quality product.	&&&
I love clorox wipes - especially for bathroom cleaning. It's such a tedious chore but I can use the wipes anywhere - sink, toilet, shower - and it's quick to clean!! Saves me a lot of time and I've already converted a couple of my friends!	&&&
"This is GREAT when your kid has a cold! It's soft and doesn't hurt their nose. Smells good too!!"	&&&
Clorox wipes are easy to use and great for small messes and and large spills. They are also great to use for quick on the go disinfecting.	&&&
I've tried a few different kinds of wipes for my 15-month-old over the last 15 months, including "natural" types and others. The only wipes that don't give his sensitive skin a rash are the very soft and smooth Pampers Sensitive wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are my favorites! Best brand of disinfecting wipes out on the market!	&&&
I buy this for my daughter who is a teacher and needs to keep her classroom clean.	&&&
These wipes are my favorite I have been using them with my family for as long as I can remember. My favorite part is unscented! They are strong wipes and very affordable. Will continue to use with my next baby.	&&&
"Wow what a great price for these wipes. I love my Veterinarian but paid almost the same price for only 20qty. These are exactly the same wipes, in a great dispenser. I am so very happy.

As for the product itself, the wipes do a great job of keeping my dogs' bellies free of the rash a couple of them were getting from being moist and they were prescribed by my vet after an exam. I also use them in the folds of my bulldogs' skin. They smell really nice too. Wash your hands after use."	&&&
With three very active boys and two extra kids for carpool, my car gets messy pretty quickly. Clorox disinfecting wipes is the go to cleaner in the car to wipe down leather seats, gross food ridden pockets and literally everything in between. I love the convenience and am sure is disinfected with a lemony scent.	&&&
"Best wipes out there! I have compared many!! Very very soft, thick semi wet and not drippy (want more moistness, just add water), more natural ingredients, and does not cause rashes.

Walmart brand:
Almost like it but not as soft and thick
Pampers Sensitive:
Very thin and super wet. Some will like this better
Target no perfume sensitive:
Super thin, weird texture. Does good on sensitive skin, Cheaper, but have to use twice as much, you add up the cost :)
Babies r us no fragrance:
Nice but not as soft, slightly smaller
BJ's No fragrance:
They changed their wipes and now are super thin and smaller. They are still soft, but not as soft as huggies. Better price though."	&&&
Never fails to impress us, thanks Huggies! Really great wipes	&&&
This is a great product! A must have for our family!	&&&
My family and I love Clorox wipes, it leaves things clean and my countertops shiny!	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use! I don't have to worry about having enough paper towels for the job because they ARE towels!	&&&
Clorox is faithfully used in our home. It whitens any surface and removes stains from many fabrics. Awesome at disinfecting and deodorizing. Best product by far. Wipes, liquid and toilet cleansers are my favorite.	&&&
Love the wipes. Prefer to use them all the time, easy to use.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! I always wipe my kitchen counters off before and after I cook and it's the easiest way to do it! Love the smell and cleans up all messes!	&&&
I love using the wipes for easy clean up. I feel like they get my counters very clean. I have a messy 5 year old so convience and cleanlieness is very important. I normally purchase these about twice a month.	&&&
As a mother of 6, I love using these wipes to disinfect my home. It is quick and easy. I would highly recommend this product to all my friends and family.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! I don't feel like the wipe is going to rip while using it and it's thick and gentle. I have been using this brand for about 5 years now ad it's the only brand of wipes that I will use.	&&&
Great for sensitive skin and durable.	&&&
I lvoe Clorax wipes. They are in my kitchen, in my bathrooms and even in my car. So handy and make clean up and disinfecting easy.	&&&
Love, Love, Love Clorox Wipes! every room in my house including my kids rooms have a container of these awesome wipes!	&&&
I use these wipes all the time. They are so convenient especially when someone in the house is sick. I will continue to use these.	&&&
I always use Clorox items! I use bleach to clean everything. I'm a mother of two little boys and they can be messy! I use Clorox and thier cleaning products to clean toys,clothes,dishes, and everything else.i highly recommend this for anyone	&&&
I keep these in my car and in my office and use them to clean up messes, and disinfect. Traveling, I can't tell you the number of times these wipes have saved the day. And when colds are going around the office, I use these on door knobs, the printer, my phone, etc. Great product!	&&&
I use the Colorox wipes in almost every room of my home. I find them very convenient and love that they kill germs. I also use them in my camper, and at my cabin.	&&&
love this stuff!!!! its great to us on everything that you need to whip down to disinfect	&&&
Clorox bleach is very powerful. Those other products can't compare. I will not spend my money on it unless it has CLOROX written on it???	&&&
works great and smells nice. perfect for when i don't want to spray cleanup	&&&
love this product especially with pets and a baby on the way!	&&&
I love these wipes. I have them in every bathroom as well as the kitchen. they are quick, convenient and make my house feel clean.	&&&
good product for what you dont worry about bleaching	&&&
I love these antibacterial wipes. They are great for travel, and I take them whenever we go out to eat at a restaurant. They are larger than the tiny wipes you usually can get. I highly recommend them.	&&&
These wipes don't work as well as the Pampers Sensitive Skin wipes, but they are super eco-friendly and easier on my baby's skin. All in all, I prefer these to the non-eco-friendly alternative.	&&&
With the cold and flu season being especially awful this year, we've been stocking up and using these wipes EVERYWHERE in our home. What a life-saver!!	&&&
I love Clorox! I use it all the time -in the kitchen, shower, bathroom, and bedroom. I need more coupons though because it is expensive; however, I pay the higher price because of the quality of the product.	&&&
I love clorox products have used them all my life its the one product i know i can depend on to disinfect and clean my home with.	&&&
love using clorox products helps keep my kids healthy	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy and convenient to use. I have very sensitive hands in the winter so running them under soapy water just to wipe off the counter takes a toll, Clorox wipes I just grab wipe and toss. So easy!	&&&
I absolute love your products. They work and hardly have to use any elbow or scrubbing does the work for you. Thank you for an awesome product Im sold on.	&&&
I love clorox products, always leave my counter tops, bathrooms and floors so clean and smelling fresh. I use it on everything, cleans and disinfects great product!!!!	&&&
I love Clorox. The smell of beach is just amazing. If it's not Clorox it just isn't clarn	&&&
These are excellent wipes. I have tried almost every wipe on the market and hands down these are the best. They have a very nice textured pattern which makes for easy cleaning. They do not smell or leave a residue. Amazing wipes!	&&&
With four kids I have to fights germs and disease.	&&&
dependable always, can always count on this product to disinfect properly and remove stains.	&&&
These wipes aren't just easy to use but can be used on so many items and are very affective!	&&&
Love the wipes!!! So easy and quick with two children on the go. I love to carry them along on trips for a quick wipe down of our rooms.	&&&
The disinfecting wipes were great for quick times when I needed to prevent the spread of germs. They were not a useful cleaning wipe for larger or messier cleaning jobs. This product would be great for use when you have sick people around, or for routine maintenance around the home. But for jobs where you actually need to scrub or absorb a lot of liquid, these wipes may not be the best choice.	&&&
I enjoy using Clorox wipes in my classroom, they help disinfect and are convenient to use.	&&&
Just finished a microbiology course. Chlorox breaks open the cell wall of harmful bacteria.	&&&
The wipes are easy to use. I use them around those house, in classrooms, and even have a can in my car.	&&&
"good value; use regularly to disinfect door knobs, phones, keyboards, etc.
to kill germs & viruses that are so prevalent with school kids (grandson) & who got sick & then got his parents sick, too. Grandparents used Lysol & did NOT get sick.""}},"	&&&
I love these wipes as they smell good and also cleans up disgusting germs along the way	&&&
"I love the clean smell."	&&&
Absolutely love huggies natural care wipes. They don't irritate my babies bottom, and don't dry her skin out when I wipe her face off with them. Wouldn't change wipes for the duration of my child's diaper years!	&&&
I always buy Charmin wipes, but the price has increased. We are a family of 7 and you need a lot of wipes. I am so glad I found Kirkland Wipes because they have a nice scent and they are just as good as Charmin wipes. They are nice and strong and just as generous in size and we have had no issues with toilets being clogged. My son is 4 and he is very picky about his wipes and the container. I used the old Charmin wipes container and put these in and he has not said one bad thing... He thinks there still Charmin wipes. There just as good if you have to buy in bulk for a big family. I even think if a guy was single or several men in one household this would be perfect because it last forever and there is no issues with wipes with a mans shaft area being hurt or sensitive to toilet paper causing issues with that area. I have almost all boys in my house. They also like that they are cleaner than using just toilet paper. It also does not cause any sticking to little ones cheeks. If you don't like a heavy scent or looking for scent free these just to let you know have a very nice scent but a scent at that... We will be buying these for a very long time.	&&&
I bought this package to take-up less space in my travel cosmetic bag. But the cleanser was so ineffective, I ended up finishing the job with the hotel soap. It barely touched my eye makeup (not even waterproof makeup) and I had to use 2 wipes to remove my face makeup...or use the hotel soap to finish the job. I will keep looking for more effective wipes that come in smaller packages for travel.	&&&
The concept for these wipes is simple, basically it's a moistened wipe that looks and feels exactly like makeup remover wipes, however you wipe it onto your body and it's supposed to make your skin feel smooth and hydrated as if you just applied lotion. Here's what ELF says about this product: "Hydrate your body with silky smooth moisture. The light and airy lotion moisturizes your skin, keepi...read moreng it soft and supple all day long. These convenient Lotion Wipes are great for on-the-go travel and mess-free application. Just throw them in your purse or bag for soothing and refreshing moisture without carrying around a bulky lotion bottle." First off let me talk about the scent, upon first pulling out a wipe I did notice a very nice sweet mango scent, once applied onto the skin the scent was barely there, once the product dried the scent almost completely went away; this is something to think about if you're one of those ladies that applies lotion only because you like to smell good. Now onto the application process: I first used these wipes on a hot sunny day, I was really sweaty and these wipes felt very cooling and refreshing on my skin. The wipes are moistened enough where you can easily apply this all over your arms and legs, and it does take about a minute to fully dry. Luckily once it dried my skin didn't feel sticky in fact it did feel very smooth. However, when I used this on an average day (at work actually) where I wasn't sweaty or hot and the wipes seemed too wet and took longer to dry and probably because my skin didn't need the hydration. Overall, I do agree that these wipes are very convenient and perfect for on the go, so having said that I prefer to use these wipes when I'm out on hikes and bike-riding basically on days where my skin is super hot and sweaty and I need the extra hydration and cooling effect, but on a daily basis I prefer regular lotion that doesn't feel as "wet" as the ELF lotion wipes felt. These regularly go for $3.00 but I purchased them for $1.50 since I had a 50% off coupon; the package comes with 15 wipes and they do have other scents such as coconut, honey, cucumber, etc.	&&&
I have extremely sensitive skin and yet needed something to remove my "last all day" type foundation, eyeliner!, and lip stain. This product gently but fully removes all those products and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean. You may still want to follow it with a quick cleanse, but in a pinch (long, long day at work & just want it off your face before you crash) this works just fine.	&&&
We really wanted to like the Pampers wipes ( we only use their diapers) but these wipes are such a weird texture that it is really hard to grab and wipe the poo off of baby's butt. It almost feels like there is some type of non-sudsing soap on the wipes that leaves a sticky residue on baby and it has a smell that is a bit off-putting. I have two packages left of these wipes and I only use them in the diaper bag. We stick to Huggies wipes	&&&
"The only ""good"" way I knew, to wash the floor, was on your hands and knees. Two buckets, changing water and rags constantly so as not to just spread dirty water around. A mop and bucket just didn't cut it. We wear white socks in the house, and I know when the floor needs washing. Obsessive? Oh, for sure. The floor mate is easy to use, and CLEANS my floor. The water is soooo dirty, it is shocking.
Be careful around the baseboards. I had my baseboards painted a year ago. The FloorMate has a protective ""rubber bumper"". I guess my baseboards were not properly prime, because the FloorMate is rubbing the right off."	&&&
Great to have in your diaper bag for dropped pacifiers, but you can also use these to clean a bottle nipple off if needed, etc..	&&&
i wish it didn't smell so orangy and the outside of the containers were sticky. i also wish it had some sort of antiseptic to clean germs from my cpap mask and other equipment.	&&&
I purchased the FH40010 Hoover FloorMate a couple of months ago and just got around to using it last week on my hardwood floors and I must say that I am VERY pleasantly surprised at how nice my floors now look. I had previously used Mop and Glo a few years ago on them and they had become very cloudy looking, not exactly how you want your nice hardwood floors throughout your home to look. I really had given up hope of having them look nice again and was considering having them refinished but dicided I would give this a try first since using a Swiffer type of mop wasn't helping. We have gone over areas like our kitchen, where you get a lot of wear, several times and each time more of the shine has been restored. I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it. I did read a lot of the reviews prior to my purchase which convinced me to give it a try and will say as others have said that you do have to go a little slow with it but for me I don't mind because of the great results I have had with it.	&&&
I love using these! always runing around behind my son cleaning up after he makes messes. I am always using them. I reccomend for everyone to use if you got really messy kids : D lol"	&&&
Let me start out by saying that I am a penny pincher. I was given a lot of Pampers wipes at my baby shower, and when I ran out, I bought the bargain brand... bad choice. Pampers were only a couple dollars more, but I am cheap. My son screamed every time I changed his diaper, and he would even get upset when I would lay him down prior to changing. I even tried Huggies wipes as well, but I did not like them at all. From here on out, I will purchase Pampers wipes for my family and for every other baby shower I attend! Pampers are soft and sensitive, they come out of the bag easily, and they don't tear!	&&&
Huggies wipes are my favorite for my son. They're about the same price as Pampers wipes, but twice the thickness. Much easier to use one Huggies wipe when you'd need two with other (thinner) brands. "	&&&
I love Clorox! It works great when you have kids and pets!	&&&
I love Clorox Bleach and I love the fact the packaging is smaller with the same stain fighting action!!	&&&
I have 5 boys and use these daily. They are great for in between weekly cleanings of the bathroom.	&&&
Wipes are wipes. If I had one complaint it would be that they are soggy, but guess that is better than being dry.	&&&
I've tried several other brand and non brand wipes and in my opinion non of them compare to Clorox Disinfecting Wipes when it comes to ease of use, noticeable cleaning power, and disinfecting around my kitchen. If you haven't tried them you really should!	&&&
This is a Great product. I use the wipes for many different things!	&&&
they work really well after you finally get them out of the container. that is no small feat."}},	&&&
I love using clorox wipes. My family is pretty active with sports the wipes make cleaninv up easy and fast	&&&
They don't feed through my wipe warmer and that is SOOOOO disappointing!!! I had to switch to seventh generation wipes because changing diapers in the dark is no fun and these wipes didn't make it any easier. I don't want to give companies on the healthier side of baby care poor reviews and I LOVE that their ingredients are so minimalistic but they need to revamp the wipe feed process to make them functional for wipe dispensers. If you can fix that, you will have a repeat customer!! Just FYI, they dry out but I am not complaint about that because that means they are so pure. Just what your little ones deserve!	&&&
Clorox Wipes are my go-to for not only quick clean ups, but for disinfecting as well.	&&&
Whenever my wife and myself use Pampers Sensitive wipes on our 2 and half month old child we know we are getting the best of the best in terms of cleaning ability, toughness, and safe for skin. The wipes hold up throughout the cleaning process and don't tear apart unlike other brands. Thank you Pampers for selling a great product I trust.	&&&
Happy Bhole	&&&
these are grea at my sons schoo. there use to disinfect eveything.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes on pretty much everything. I especially like the toilet bowl cleaners and the spray that is great on stains.	&&&
I like using clorox wipes because they are convenient, and disinfect. They don't streak like another brand that shall not be named. :)	&&&
I have kids that can mess up any and everything. I love clorox because been a trust staple in my family for years. (30 Plus yearas	&&&
We use clorox wipes for quick, easy clean up in the kitchen and bathroom. They are great for those messes that need quick attention!	&&&
This is a very good product esp. that I am very conscious regarding the cleanliness esp in the kitchen. I would definitely recommend this product!	&&&
I use these wipes to clean bathroom and kitchen surfaces. I had hopes that the "lemon and lime" scent would neutralize the pungent Lysol/disinfectant odor, but to me these still smell pretty awful. They do, however, do the job. The wipes themselves are very sturdy and don't tear or shred. And the fact that they come laden with Lysol makes them very convenient.	&&&
"I absolutely enjoy this set of soft Bamboo Baby Washcloths. In this bundle you get six different washcloths, each 10in by 10in. You get two of each color: soft green, ivory white, and pale blue. Each washcloth is individually bundled with a decorative green and white poka-dotted ribbon. I find having the ribbons to tie the washcloths is very convenient because you can reuse the ribbons for a baby scrapbook or to tie a small bow on small gifts or objects.
Each washcloth is super soft, organic, and natural, made from the finest bamboo terry cloth to provide the best quality available for your delicate little one! This soft fabric will not irritate your baby's sensitive skin, and provides a comforting warmth that not very many washcloths can do for your baby.
I highly recommend this pack of Brooklyn Bamboo Baby Washcloths for any occasion, whether it be for a baby shower or for your own child's comfort and enjoyment in mind. If you wash these cloths correctly they will last for quite a while and won't unravel on you during usage. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
Easy to use and no scent. Lets you keep your mask squeaky clean every day for a reasonable price.	&&&
They were too thin. The wipes I currently use are thicker and are more soapy.	&&&
It's not any more special than other wipes I've tried. I'm a mom who likes the baby powder smell and I missed it with this product.	&&&
The Amazon Basics wipes have become our new favorite! They are inexpensive, readily available for a quick delivery (what parent doesn't appreciate that?), and the wipes are a quality product to keep in our home. We have used name brand thick, strong wipes that seem to be full of chemicals, and generic brand ones meant for sensitive skin that are so thin, they rip. The Amazon Basics wipes are the perfect balance, and available in a sensitive formula. Our kids have had no negative reactions, and I have even made them part of my sensitive skin routine in removing makeup. Perfect! We will buy them again and again.	&&&
They work like your standard wipes. However, I was disappointed in this brand having still a lot of weird and unfamiliar ingredients. I started making my own wipes with just aloe vera, lavender castile soap and water. My daughter hardly ever gets diaper rash now!	&&&
I like how I dont need to use cloth rags or paper towels to clean. This product make my life easy since I have 2 kids and they always make messes fast!	&&&
We LOVE Clorox wipes. As a home daycare provider, things can get messy around here. Clorox wipes are easy to grab and disinfect my home. They are a must-have for me!	&&&
Love Clorox! Sometimes you just need some real power for the job and I can always rely on Clorox to get it done! Only thing I would love to see them change is less odor from their products.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great, especially when you have sick kids. Nice to know you are getting rid of the germs that make them sick.	&&&
clorox wipes are my favorite household product. they are very convenient and get tough grease off my counter tops.	&&&
The waited plate and easiness of this is good. Wipes don't always come out 1 at a time but the way this dispenser is built, you can just leave the extra wipes in it and it will stay fresh. So much better then the plastic ones that come with the wipe. Very happy I got this!	&&&
Clorox is the best cleaning product in my cleaning pantry! It's my go to cleaning product every time	&&&
My tub of clorox wipes is a standard on my kitchen counter and in my bathrooms! Easy to grab to quickly clean up a mess!	&&&
I love clorox. my clothes and tables and toys are clean with clorox. Easy to use and never let's me down.	&&&
In our house it is a MUST to wipe down all surfaces in the kitchen with clorox wipes before we go to sleep. Nothing like waking up to a clean fresh kitchen.	&&&
Compared to all other wipes i have used these never tear and get the job done. They remain intact when nature requires a little extra elbow grease. Plus they are gentle on my sons skin.	&&&
These wipes are so easy and convenient, even my kids can use them to help clean up.	&&&
I love the ease of use of the wipes. They clean well, have a nice smell and do not leave streaks on mirrors.	&&&
I love using wipes to clean with. Even larger messes are easy to clean up using Clorox Wipes!	&&&
I enjoy the cleanliness I get after using the Clorox wipes	&&&
Good product. I love the way it smells and how it is easy for a rushed morning. Great at dried on food too!	&&&
I am coming back to purchase another package of these wipes. They do a good job of removing my make up, even my eye make up. I really like the scent. These are the best I have found. They were a lifesaver for me on a recent red eye flight.	&&&
i love using the disinfecting wipes because I have four kids who make messes and it is much easier to just grab the container!!	&&&
I not only use the wipes at home, I take them into work to help cut down on the germs everyone brings in.	&&&
I like all the Clorox products, but lemon is my favorite. I love the convenient use and the spell. I use them all the time at home and work.	&&&
Easy to use when you have kids and not enough time	&&&
Good product, this kind requires a container to put then in, sense I had one, it works very well.	&&&
These clorox wipes have a great cleaning power & smell great.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes! Use them daily for all messes around my house...which is a lot with a toddler running around!	&&&
Clorox products are great quality at reasonable prices	&&&
Why I buy Clorox. Its a powerful cleaner & disinfects.	&&&
We love Clorox disinfecting wipes! They are so convenient to use to clean the sink or toilet in a hurry or just for everyday use. They are even easy for my children to use as well. It has been a great way to teach them how to keep the bathroom clean. We highly recommend these!	&&&
Teachers love these clorox wipes, wipes those little germs right off those desks. Keeps everyone healthier and happy.	&&&
I love the lemony scent of the wipes. They are so much easier too use than spray and paper towels, in addition it disinfects.	&&&
Having two kids under 4 in the house gets very little chores done. I always have clorox wipes around because they are very convenient for every day messes and easy to use. i use them in every room from the kitchen to the bathroom. Thank you for your products they make my job around the house 10 times easier.	&&&
These are the only wipes I buy. They don't have all the harsh chemicals and are great quality. They are very tough, but can still be torn if you only need part of one. They retain moisture well and can be remoistened easily. I tried a couple others early on with my 2.5 year old, but this is he only one I'll buy now.	&&&
Clorox really does a good job removing dirt and grime!	&&&
we love the clorox wipes, especially with having kids!	&&&
Love this stuff! I could do without the lemon scent, but it's great for cleaning up quick.	&&&
I used these wipes every time I clean my bathroom. I love it.	&&&
i love these wipes. I have a canister in every room in my house.	&&&
The title really says it all. Other disinfecting wipes leave a residue behind, but Clorox wipes disinfect and then leave everything looking and feeling the way it should.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes - they are in my car the kitchen in the bathroom and near the fridge.	&&&
product is handy, easy to use, and makes me feel secure knowing my home is disinfected.	&&&
"I love these wipes! My family and I go to theme parks at least once a month, to playgrounds, parks, grocery stores and a bunch of other places several times a week. This product comes in handy so often that we hate not having them when we run out. We have two children under the age of three, and we use a lot of regular wipes normally. Now we use the gumdrop wipes for so much, and they are so small and convenient to grab. I just wish you had one with a strap or something, so we could hook it to the outside of our dipper bags or strollers."	&&&
clorox works great, would recommend this to everyone.	&&&
I've tried many other cleaning wipes in the past and Clorox wipes by far does the job while using less than the bargain brand!!	&&&
Clorox wipes are my favorite, especially during cold & flu season.	&&&
love using the wipes instead of spray. i can clean alot with just one.	&&&
Clorox products are the best for cleaning my bathroom.	&&&
This is a Great product that I use every day! I'd recommend it to anyone!	&&&
My little boy got a really bad diaper rash from daycare and I bought these wipes because they were extra sensitive, he didn't cry like he did when i used the other wipes and they were so gentle on his skin.	&&&
I love using Clorox disinfectant wipes around my house daily. I have a little one under one, and she likes to get her hands on everything. I take comfort in knowing my home is clean and germ free when I use the wipes! The container is easily accessible and ready whenever I need to grab a wipe quickly. They have a fresh, clean scent. I will always have Clorox wipes in the house. I never want to run out!-	&&&
We've used these wipes for both our kids. At different times they would have sensitive skin, but the Natural Care wipes were our standby because they never caused irritation or added to diaper rash. A couple times because of availability, we had tried other wipes brands. But, they were either too flimsy to be any good, or they caused irritation. We recently discovered that Costco carried this in gigantic quantities (1100, if I recall). What's even better is that the price of them is comparable to lesser-quality generics. Great job, Huggies!	&&&
The article is very nice to use the olor and the results is excellent.	&&&
I use disinfectant wipes for the kitchen counters and table. I love how easy it is and how they are moist every time i grab one from the canister.	&&&
"These were a major disappointment, being a Rain-X brand product.
They left streaking on CLEAN windows, and did NOT prevent humidity from accumulating on rear window.
I used twice, and then TOSSED THEM in the garbage."	&&&
My girls are allergic to baby wipes so we have to use dry clothe wipes and water. These are great! They are thick, decent size and work great as baby wipes!	&&&
If you read the ingredient list these wipes are far from "natural". They still work like wipes should though. I feel the "natural" aspect is just a marketing ploy, but whatever works I guess...	&&&
these are the best wipes ever! They clean very well. They have sensitive if your baby needs them. They are gentle on the babys skin	&&&
Baby's butt has never been so clean.	&&&
Product works but not as well as huggies natural wipes.	&&&
Pampers sensitive wipes are wonderful. They're very soft and moist.	&&&
Did not clean as well as my current wipes.	&&&
very convenient, and the scent isn't too overpowering	&&&
Cleans well with a fresh scent. Wipes are very convenient for quick clean ups.	&&&
this product works great! it's convenient, makes cleaning up easy. you always get a good deal when buying these wipes. i really like using these when i clean.	&&&
These work well and I like that they are individually packaged, but they are expensive. Walmart offers a very comparable product at half the price	&&&
Love Clorox disinfecting wipes. They are very convenient. Especially with kids and puppies and all there messes.	&&&
We have been using these for our baby since we got back from the hospital. I have created my own baby wipes formulation. I put the wipes in a container with the liquid... everything is soaked up by the dry wipes and they have a perfect level of moisture. I use boiling water (2.5 cups) + coconut oil (main component ~ 2TBS) + vitamin E (1TBS) + baby soap (just tsp) Our baby has never had any issues associated with diaper rash etc... coconut oil is very good and safe for baby delicate and sensitive skin. The wipes are moist silky and wonderful...	&&&
I love this product, it is quick and convenient for the fast clean ups and when you don't want to mess with a spray.	&&&
"Really strong scent that fills my bathroom and this is a problem for me. I don't like my bathroom/house smelling like fake fragrance. It raises concern for me, being that I'm putting this stuff on my face and the scent is so strong, and it's not a scent that comes from anything natural. I feel like I'm smearing febreze or glade all over my face, eyes and all over my bathroom. Kind of nauseating.
If you don't wear a lot of make-up do not get these, it's a waste. The cloths/wipes are big and I usually only need like a corner of one single wipe but then I'm standing there wondering if it's not hygienic to put it back into the packet to use the rest of the wipe another time. Seriously, I could re-use one wipe for an entire week. So, I end up wasting each wipe, not using much of it. If you wear a lot of make up on your eyes and stuff like foundations and powders on your face, then this would probably suit you, you would probably use each wipe completely. But if you don't wear much make up, then use a bottle of liquid make up remover with a cotton ball so you can control how much product you need with each usage."	&&&
I am a teacher and I love to use Clorox wipes to keep my classroom clean and germ-free. Thanks!	&&&
Wipe your behind with these! You'll never go back to your bidet!	&&&
We've been using these wipes for the last 7 years. 3 kids, 7 years and only in the last few months, I've noticed they changed the formula and the wipes have this horrible smell to them. My daughter started to develop a diaper rash more frequently, as well. Sad to say goodbye but I think it's time.	&&&
best cleaning for all those with obsessive cleaners with dirty kids and husbands	&&&
love the wipes they are easy to use and convenient for the hubby and kids	&&&
"This product is great. The wipes are just the right temperature and not cold once you take them out of the unit. You do have to allow it to heat up before using the wipes if you want them to be warm and not cold. The instructions are very easy to follow. Highly recommend it if you wish to use warm wipes on your baby"	&&&
These Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes work great. They are non bleached so they are yellow in color. They are a thicker rougher dust wipe than a Swiffer wipe. A similar texture to a dried out Clorox wet wipe. They advertise that one wipe can clean an entire room. That is probably true depending on how much furniture you have to clean in each room. I tested these immediately on the window blind above my kitchen sink. That blind gets dirty quickly and it is difficult for me to reach for a properly cleaning. The Clorox Dust wipe worked great. It took one Clorox wipe to get the whole blind clean. It trapped the dust on the wipe very well. I did have to give the blind a good rub to get all the dust off. A quick wipe wouldn't work to collect the dust, but the build up is my own fault. On my other wood furniture that is dusted more often, a quick swipe with the Clorox Wipe was enough to clean off the dust. I would recommend these wipes. The wipe boxes opens on the side so the front lifts up. I was so eager to get at these I missed the open here mark and opened from the top of the box. Which made it more difficult to get the wipes out. It was my own fault.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes These are the best ever..would not change them for the world..love them!	&&&
I love keeping clorox wipes around for every use in the kitchen and bathroom. We can't live without them!	&&&
It's very good because to carry baby wipes in the purse, it's lighter to carry and keep the wipes wet.	&&&
i love how easy clorox wipes are for little messes like spilled milk etc, it cleans it up, doesnt waste too much product, and disinfects at the same time.	&&&
Save your money. This case dries out the baby wipes, and it's a bulky case. It's actually bigger than the package the wipes come in, (we use The Honest Co. wipes), so we just carry an extra pack instead of using this case.	&&&
All time favorite wipes! They take everything off, or at least enough for me to come in with a cleanser right after and know for a fact that all my make up is completely removed. I love the smell of these wipes as well! It's extremely calming and perfect for removing your make up right before bed, hence "night relaxing." I already love Clean & Clear's regular make up removing wipes and these night relaxing ones are just a plus more. I hope they never discontinue them. MUCH RECOMMENDED!	&&&
Now I have not only a baby, but a baby blog, and ninety percent of moms agree, pampers is the must have, go to, will not do without brand! From diapers wipes, pampers are the only brand we will use. "	&&&
These wipes are my number 1 life savor in college! They clean and wipe almost all stains and they also have a fresh scent too! I like! They come in handy as well! Won't trade it for any other wipes!"	&&&
I always hated using cold wipes on my baby, it would make them cry and who want a cold wipe on their bottom?	&&&
This was another product that I thought was completely unnecessary and did not plan on buying. However a few weeks in we realized how hard it was to remember to wet a cloth before we undressed baby (especially middle of the night)...leaving us in the dilemma of leaving the baby on the table or carrying a naked newborn to the sink. Now we always have warm wet wipes right at the table. I've had it for 4 months and haven't replaced the filter, seems fine. It holds a lot more than ten wipes if you fold them instead of roll them. It comes with some wipes but I also use GroVia cloth wipes which are much nicer.	&&&
Wipes were very watery and didn't seem to help clean up much	&&&
Awesome wipes. This is a generous box of refill packs in re-sealable bags. It also includes one plastic box/dispenser.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes. I used them from the time my son was a newborn and I still buy them even though he is potty trained. They don't irritate my son's skin and each wipe pops up out of the package easily.	&&&
Very nice and moist wipes. Well moisturized. Skin feels very smooth after wiping. It has weird fragrance to it though.	&&&
I have not had any issues with these with flushing. Cloth is durable.	&&&
Whoop whoop!!! Got cleaned.	&&&
These work great. My glasses do not get scratched.	&&&
My baby just love these! She prefers it than any other brands plus the tub helps alot with the pull outs.the wipes dont stick together when you pull them out from the tub. It makes it easier and convenient to use than any other brands	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They disinfect so good and I like that since I have a baby at home.	&&&
These are easy to grab to use around the house. It is not always easy to have a bucket around.	&&&
Good product, I use this product everywhere I want to be disinfected. I use them at work, home, car, and etc	&&&
love the clorox wipes would recomend!!!!!!!!!!!!1 they are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111	&&&
I love these wipes for quick kitchen and bathroom wiping. Wiping off the counters and toilet frequently make the deep cleaning sessions so much easier!	&&&
These things are so easy to use and makes cleanup a breeze.	&&&
I really love these disinfecting wipes! It takes a second to clean up messes now, with no hassle.	&&&
I use these everyday. with 2 small children messes happen fast and these wipes are perfect for quickly cleaning my counters, sink, stove, and doorknobs. each wipe gets m really far which is m favorite part. it doesn't take a bunch of them to clean my counters or stove.	&&&
Its awesome! Great of the house and car. Great a school.	&&&
We were carrying around wipes in a ziploc baggy for a LONG time, but we realized that the cute and stylish huggies bags/boxes were SO much easier to carry around. Plus, they keep the wipes moist after weeks.	&&&
Can't wait to clean my bathroom tonight with this product	&&&
Convenient way to keep counters clean. Keep Clorox under the sink for easy retrieval!	&&&
They aren't my favorite, but ok for the price.. Tears easier (that's a bad thing) than pampers brand:/	&&&
Gives my cat a clean and shinney coat	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They're easy for a quick clean-up. I especially use them in the bathroom.	&&&
Pampers Sensitive Wipes are the first wipes I used with my son and they are sure to be the last. Not only are these fragrance free wipes gentle, they are also thick and durable. I know that we are getting our money's worth from the simple fact that we are using less wipes per diaper change.	&&&
I trust only Clorox to clean my home! Nothing is better than Clorox!	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes, use them for everything. With a toddler in the house, there's always messes that need to be cleaned up and these are good on any surface. Always have at least one canister of these in our house!	&&&
Great when you have kids or grand-kids. Makes you feel safer with all the germs that are around.	&&&
I am particular to the lemon Clorox wipes because they make my kitchen smell so clean and shiny. Just the fact that I can grab one little wipe from the container and clean up after my cooking catastrophes is such a relief and time saver. Another tip.. they are fabulous in cleaning up moldings, doors, and walls! Say goodbye to the tracks your little ones leave behind, Thank you Clorox!	&&&
these wipes are so powerful! they definitely get the job done!	&&&
ALWAYS WORK! A really great product and so convenient to have in this form. You can keep them in any room.	&&&
i have seen others put a bad review... these are great and work well when wet. idk why others say it leaves things on the nail it doesnt	&&&
These are soft and smell good and I love saying, Let's use the boogie wipes!, probably more than my daughter enjoys getting her boogies wiped...."	&&&
"""This is a great product. I can pull the wipe with one hand only, smooth opening and easy to clean. The window is very convenient when you are running low in wipes.

When I need the wipe warm I pour water from a thermo in a bowl (specially in winter) and wet the wipe in there.

Perfect for every baby shower. A must in every nursery."""	&&&
I have tried multiple brands of wipes, to include store brands and huggies and Pampers baby wipes are my favorite. Although the other brands are slightly cheaper, Pampers are worth it because the wipe doesn't tear as I'm pulling it out of the dispenser and I utilize less when wiping than any other brand.	&&&
I won't buy other wipes because this is simply a great value. They are not as thick as some leading brands, but they are strong. I also love the flip top lid.	&&&
I purchased these for camping and hiking. The scent is great and you really do feel clean after using. I recommend, affordable way to keep clean outdoors or when you are in a hurry.	&&&
After trying the sensitive wipes, these are my all time favorite wipes using for the baby. I love the length of these wipes, the gentleness, and the fact that they're still unscented is a winner for me.	&&&
These wipes are the only ones strong enough to get the job done when bottoms are messy.	&&&
THIS PACKAGE WAS CHEAPER THAN THE STORE BRAND AND PROVIDED MORE QUANTITY AS WELL	&&&
I love that these are food safe and don't smell like vinegar or like cleaning supplies, neither of which I would want my baby sucking on.	&&&
I've been using These wipes to cut the cost of wipes down since i have two boys wearing diapers at the same time, its true they aren't very most,but hey the wipe every kind of mess up!"	&&&
The wipes are so easy my 5 year old can use them. Nothing to spray or worry about spilling. Gets rid of bacteria and helps keep the house clean.	&&&
Have worked very well for us, but we've used this brand from the start! Daycare teachers have commented on how much better these work than other brands.	&&&
I have a 1 year old and clorox wipes have made my life so much easier! I love them!	&&&
"This is the 2nd warmer unit from this company that we are using had the last model for over two years when it started to heat the wipes less and less so we purchased this newer model a couple weeks ago. I like the heavier frame and that the spot wipes are pulled out of is a heavier rubber and grabs the wipes well. Only issue I have is that the last model had a one hand push buttom to open the top and this one doesnt so you have to hold the warmer and pull the top open every diaper change so the top wipes gets slightly colder. But not a huge issue."	&&&
These are handy, and do seem to pick up all the dust. It probably took two, rather than the one described, to dust a room. Those swiffer things sometimes push the dust around, and these wipes do a better job of collecting the dust. A box of these is pretty cost effective, as 54 will last quite a while. My only reservation is that my hands come into contact with the wipes, and I find that a bit irritating, and need to wash my hands immediately. All in all, these are a good product and are very useful for this cleaning chore.	&&&
The wipes are wonderful for cleaning and sanitizing. I don't have to worry about germs anymore!	&&&
These baby wipes are just wet enough, durable, and sensitive for our baby skin. We have tried many brands and this one is the best!	&&&
Great Product and disinfects well. I use these wipes in Bathroom and In my kitchen.	&&&
I Like how the wipes picks up everything from the area you're trying to clean	&&&
I got a whole box of these wipes for free as a deal target was having when you buy two boxes of diapers. These are not my favorite wipes. They do the job but I'm looking forward to when I run out of these so I can use my preferred brand again. They rip and tear coming out of the holder and just aren't as sturdy as I'd like for them to be.	&&&
love it! i wouldn't use any other product with my 4 year old around!	&&&
Love these wipes. Feel sturdy than the pampers wipes. Great subscribe and save pricing.	&&&
Sturdy wipe for a great price, I buy them buy the cases!	&&&
Clorox wipes are a great product for disinfecting surfaces that harbor germs. Great for cleaning kitchen counters, door handles and in general.	&&&
Great smell	&&&
love the ease of use and how it disinfects. I feel like my home is cleaner with a simple swipe.	&&&
Excellent to disinfect and clean toilet. Love this product.	&&&
love the wipes so easy to use in bathroom and kitchen even my kids can clean	&&&
After 7 months of use, the edges are starting to fray a little. These are definitely not my favorite wipes. They are very, very thin and stick to each other when wet and in the dispenser. So, I alternate them with other cloth wipes. Not bad for a cheap option, but wouldn't purchase again. I am much happier with the Grovia brand, which I found 2nd hand on ebay for not much more $ than these.	&&&
Great wipes, subscription service works great and the wipes show up just in time. Not sure about the one and done though, if anyone has cleaned up baby poop you know you are going to need more than one wipe.	&&&
Not a fan of the strong lemon scent but overall does a wonderful job. I usually go for one of the lighter scents in these wipes and use them all the time.	&&&
We've been using Costco wipes nonstop since we had our first son 6 years ago. Now we are ready to switch to a different brand because of the new smell. It is so yeasty and awful. Not only do the wipes smell, it leaves the smell on my little one's skin. Please change back to the old formula Costco!	&&&
Of all the wipes I've tried I liked these the least. Sure they did their job but they left a very slimy feel behind both on my baby's bottom and on my hands. I'd recommend Wegman baby wipes unscented over these any day.	&&&
I love boogie wipes! Yes you can use normla wipes for little noses, but these smell yummy and it just awesome with the saline added in for if the babies have raw noses. And I love the grape smell!	&&&
I work at a bank and we use Clorox Wipes ALL the time. Money is actually really gross so we frequently wipe down our teller stations and other surfaces with Clorox Wipes to prevent the spread of germs. They have been exceptionally useful here around cold and flu season!	&&&
I will always have these in my home because they make it so quick and convenient to clean up spills and disinfect surfaces.	&&&
I LOVE clorox wipes! Having 2 kids, I use them in every room in the house! They are my "go-to" cleaning product!!	&&&
I have a canister on my kitchen counter and wipe down every night and after any spills. wipe down cabinet handles. Keeps things nice and clean	&&&
I love these wipes!!! Love the smell and that they disinfect!! SO convenient!!	&&&
The wipes work great. They are easy to use for quick qipe ups of kids messes.	&&&
Great quality wipes. No sent, no oily residue. I use it for diapers, clean the whole baby body, including FCE and mouse during feeding. My child does not fuss when being cleaned with this wipe. Do not tear easily, large enough.	&&&
i have newborn twins so I am kind of a germ freak and I love Clorox wipes because they are very convenient and easy to use!!!	&&&
Sometimes you need to do a quick clean of something and don't want to pull out the cleaning sponge or rag or whatever you use. This is a quick and easy way to do a spot clean or whatever and be done. I also now let my daughter grab a couple wipes and wipe off all the doorknobs in the house a few times a week. Its her chore and makes her feel like a big girl and she's doing her part to stop germs from spreading during the winter months!	&&&
"I've been told that things of this nature are a waste of money, but my son has been congested with a runny nose on and off all winter. I bought these because his poor nose was cracked and bleeding from all the wiping! These have been a life saver!! They remover dried snot better than anything plus they leave his nose soft! I thought the smell would also please my little guy but that actually doesn't matter! None the less I will continue to buy these! They are absolutely the best!!"	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes work well for all purpose cleaning. I love them. They are convenient and powerful.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for cleaning the toilet seat and disinfecting almost anything.	&&&
I love them I must buy a case a month. My grandchildren live with us and they are young . The wipes are my lifesavers	&&&
Clorox Lemon Wipes make cleaning my house so much easier! On top of that, they smell great and refreshing. I would highly recommend this product.	&&&
Love the container. Small and easy to store on desk or to carry if needed. Also like the fun decorative patterns that it comes in. I used them for my new touch screen laptop and they work well for the screen and the keypad."}},	&&&
I do like these wipes, they definitely have a noticeable amount of Tea Tree Oil in them but the first batch I received were dried out, and one of the packages had cut marks in them from when the warehouse cut into the boxes and it cut into the plastic wrap of one of the packages I received. The second order was ok, but these wipes do not stay moist for long periods of time. I wish the packaging had more of just a piece of clear tape used to reseal the packaging when you remove a wipe. I use these wipes several times in the day to refresh my skin and to remove any oil buildup. I would purchase again.	&&&
I have always used these wipes. I even use them for wiping my dog after he does his business.	&&&
Amazing product... as a mother of 3 children these are so handy...great for cleaning up everyday messes or deep cleaning!!	&&&
I have tried other wipes and I like the way the sensitive wipes feel they are very soft.	&&&
I just love these wipes. They are so durable they can be used for heavy duty jobs like washing cars or windows. The thick weavings alone allow each cloth to be reused numerous times and they last a good long time. It's unfortunate these Handi Wipes are no longer available in many local retail and grocery stores but I'm happy this multi pack can be purchased here at Amazon. The cost is reasonably affordable and they're the best wipes to use for household chores. Happy with this purchase and hope Amazon will continue its availability with this product.	&&&
These wipes are perfectly soft and not drenched in moisture like some other wipes have been. But I don't have to use as many to get a fresh clean!	&&&
I love using this product in my classroom to clean my students' desks.	&&&
I really like these products! & the coupon is just a bonus!	&&&
so easy when you have a little one around to grab one and clean	&&&
I absolutely love the wipes! They are so easy to use and work well to clean up effectively after my young children.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great when you have 3 children and you need to keep your house clean of as many germs as possible.	&&&
We really like clorox wipes in this family. It allows me to clean up after 4 kids easily and get back to family time.	&&&
i love this for my desk at work. conveinant and redily avail	&&&
I love this product. it keeps my family safe from germs and with 3 kids this helps save on doctors visits	&&&
I've been using this product for years -- fantastic!	&&&
Love these wipes. Especially when I walk back in the room I've just cleaned. I KNOW it's clean & it smells super!!	&&&
These wipes are very handy for on the go. They don't leave your hands feeling sticky or slimy. Great product."	&&&
I used to use another brand and felt that it made my face very dry and felt like it was filled with chemicals. These wipes make my face feel very clean without drying it out or feeling like I added a bunch of chemicals to it.	&&&
These are magical. No irritation, no fuss, sturdy and affordable! The only wipes we use!!	&&&
Wipes are soft and gentle on babys skin. They smell nice too.	&&&
. . . as good as any pampers wipes or competing brands. If you're looking for a reasonably priced alternative to the name brands in order to save a few bucks this is a good deal.	&&&
I love pampers products. My children both have sensitive skin so these wipes work great for them.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. Have used them ever since they first came out. Myself though not a fan of the lemon fragrance. Too strong for my liking.	&&&
I really enjoy using this product. It really smell great and it is easy to use. As a school teacher, it is very important that I keep my classroom clean and germ free. I love Clorox disinfecting wipes!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes on a daily basis. When you have a toddler who is potty training convenience is the most important factor. Love these wipes! The scent is great, I know they clean, and they don't try out like other brands. I have these wipes everywhere, in the car, in the bathroom, the kitchen and even in the garage!	&&&
Easy to use, rich in water. The only disadvantage is that too many wipes in one package makes it hard to keep moist.	&&&
Great for easy clean up and disinfecting. With all the germs and contaminants, it is good to know there is any easy way to protect yourself.	&&&
Love the convenience of these wipes for tough spills that paper towels alone can't clean	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. Very convenient and easy to use. I use them to clean up around the toilet every now and then. I use them to wipe down my kids toys to keep germs from spreading. I even use them to wipe off my stove and microwave and fridge handles. Anything that gets grimy... I use these.	&&&
Clorox is the best ,keeps my house clean and my kids healthy	&&&
Clorox wipes are great to use to clean the bathrooms and kitchen. It makes me feeld that everything is disinfected and safe.	&&&
I attribute my family's good health to your wonderful disinfecting wipes and use them daily and ALL the time (just ask my husband, the canister is ALWAYS out!!). I love your products hands down and would never use anything else. Thank You for manufacturing such a safe and effective product!!	&&&
My daughter, age 6, came to me and told me she "goobered up"....yes, V8 juice...UGH! Guess what got every speck clean - Clorox wipes!	&&&
"Very happy with these wipes easy to clean up any spills easy to wipe down counter tops and easy to wipe down door knobs love the fresh clean scent"	&&&

THIS PRODUCT IS A MUST FOR OFFICE CLEANLINESS. THEY ARE HANDY & TEAR APART EASY. THEY ARE USEFUL TO CLEAN & DISINFECT HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS & SURFACES WHERE PEOPLE COMMONLY TOUCH WITH THEIR HANDS SUCH AS DOOR KNOBS, FAUCET KNOBS, INK PENS ETC. THEY SMELL NICE & CLEAN & LEAVE A WONDERFUL SCENT AFTER USING. THE PRICE FOR THE 3 PACK IS GREAT. TRY THEM! I KNOW YOU'D LIKE THEM. THEY ARE GREAT FOR THE OFFICE, HOME & CAR. YOU CAN USE THEM TO WIPE DOWN INTERIOR CAR SURFACES AND INDOOR FURNITURE. ONCE YOU USE THEM, YOU WILL USE THEM AGAIN.	&&&
I am a proud mom of two toddler boys that make so many messes from the time they rise and til bed time. Clorox Wipes are a life saver! So easy to use, even my 4 year old wants to help me clean.	&&&
The disinfecting wipes are quick and easy to use but also tackles heavy dirt and grime.	&&&
Great product and I use it everyday. I plan on purchasing this all year long. Happy customer!	&&&
I always buy Clorox bleach for my laundry. We use generic products a lot of the time but the generic bleach just doesn't work as well. I also think Clorox smells better. You would think bleach smells like bleach but it smells cleaner.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because they allow me to clean up messes quick and know they are disinfected too. I use them almost everywhere in my house. My kitchen is not complete without them to wipe down the counters after cooking. They are great for use in the bathrooms and just about anywhere else too.	&&&
The wipes are so convenient even with a baby in one arm, i can still tackle tough messes with the wipes. great product.	&&&
LOVE this product, especially since i have toddlers!	&&&
It's prefect and convenient for a fast clean. I love it and cant live without it.	&&&
I was raised using Clorox. It's the number one disinfective in my household.	&&&
I have three children, 6,9,and 18. The 6 and 9 year olds are messy in any and everything they do. Clorox wipes makes cleaning up behind them easier then without. My 18 year old hates spray cleaning products and we always fight over weather or not she is really disinfecting surfaces because she wont use sprays of no sort. Clorox wipes is a peace maker between us because she doesn't mind using the wipes at all.	&&&
Great product! Really gets rid of stains and whitens clothes! Also a great price for the product.	&&&
Ive been using Clorox product as long as I can remember! I love it and I always find my house fresh and clean.	&&&
They clean the messes without leaving a filmy residue	&&&
I like these wipes I use them with the bathroom and kitchen sinks. The only drawback is that the wipes don't always come out at the top and sometimes I grab 2 or none.	&&&
Love Clorox wipes! Convenient, easy to use, good disinfectant. Always have in the house, car and when we travel. Does not dry out.	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox Disinfecting wipes! I have them in my home, car, boat, and purse. They are great for a quick and easy clean up job!	&&&
Clorox wipes are so easy to use. I love the convenience and the ease of just grabbing them out of the cabinet and go!	&&&
These wipes smell great, are so convenient, and easy to use. My only complaint is that sometimes they leave a touch of residue behind when they dry...not terrible enough that I won't use them though.	&&&
this comes with 4 packages. you get more than 8 times the amount for less than the cost of a small package of a name brand. they work well.	&&&
I love that you don't need to let dry before before use. Great price	&&&
Of all the wipes I've tried, these are the best! Nice and thick and strong! All the other ones feel too thin!	&&&
We have tried Huggies and target brand wipes and in my opinion pampers are the best! They are wet and not rough on my baby's skin.	&&&
Not harsh on my newborns delicate skin. Smells fresh and does not have a strong scent.	&&&
these are great for travel with a menstrual cup. i never like cleaning mine out with just toilet paper, this is definitely better and easy to use.	&&&
"I use these with some warm water when my daughter has a diaper rash, they don't bother her as much as the store bought wet wipes seem to. They work great for all kinds of diaper messes. They are sturdier than they look too, they stay together after lots of wash cycles.
I was going to use these with cloth diapers all the time, but we ended up using disposable diapers and wetwipes. For anyone looking for cloth wipes to use instead of wetwipes from the store, though, I would recommend these."	&&&
I have used these ever since I have been using CPAP. They do a good job to clean up the mask between good cleanings. They do what they are supposed to. Glad to see these on Amazon now. Will buy again.	&&&
If the flu season upon us you can't be to clean. I use these to wipe off my counters after my husband removes all his stuff he thinks isn't dirty like the newspaper and mail ,keys ,cell phone,etc he drags in after work."}},	&&&
I love the ease of the Clorox wipes. They are smell nice and clean well. I feel that they are killing germs as well.	&&&
I have used these wipes for the past 4 years and they are the absolute best!! When my babies have had runny noses regular wipes just don't make the cut. They are so soft my babies don't mind or turn their heads when it's time for me to clean their nose and they smell great!! Small enough to fit in your purse and diaper bag without taking up to much space.	&&&
Clorox® Disinfecting Wipes (Lemon) smell like clean!	&&&
I have a home daycare Clorox wipes are convenient. I trust in this product has cleaned my house. Love and trust Clorox wipes.	&&&
We use the wipes all the time we have two young kids and it is very easy to pop the top and wipes up messes.	&&&
There's no other product that cleans and disinfects like clorox. Makes daily cleaning much easier. I love to use clorox on everything!	&&&
Love the fact that the wipes do not leave a residue	&&&
"These wipes are the only thing my son will tolarate on his sore nose when he is sick and the grape smells great too!!"	&&&
I use the clorox bleach the most it whitens better than any off brand from my experience. I use it when I wash dishes, toilets, whites, and any thing else you can think off. I use it all the time in the bathroom & kitchen because i know that it will disinfect everything.	&&&
It's a great time saver in the kitchen or bathroom. Leaves behind a lovely fresh scent and a grand shine.	&&&
You can always count on these wipes to give you a great clean every single time.	&&&
The clorox wipes made great gifts for teachers this year. I also love them for home use.	&&&

Clorox is one of the most powerful kitchen wipes. Especially since the new grease formula.	&&&
great product....love disinfecting with it, convenient and easy to use!	&&&
"These wipes are great!! Although, it's suppose to be fragrance free, there is a slight fresh scent. Most wipes only come in 25 per package. There are 30 with these which I think is a better deal!!

*Review by Tom's Chu's wife."	&&&
I love this product!!! The wipes are easy to use and I don't have to worry about fading my clothes just to clean surfaces. It doesn't take a bunch of wipes to clean one surface...it's one and done. Thank you from a very happy customer.	&&&
Large packages, smell great and get the job done cleaning. These were shipped nicely and arrived quickly.	&&&
I love Clorox! Never found a cleaner that's better	&&&
Love the fresh smell and the wetness of the wipes. Other brands seem to have drier wipes that do not clean as well	&&&
Clorox wipes are right at your fingertips. Not only do they clean, but disinfect as well!	&&&
I use these mostly because they are convenient and easy to grab and get something cleaned up. They are a life saver for the bathroom. And I also like knowing they disinfect.	&&&
Great to have. The grands can eat in the living room as long as I have these close by. Just one wipe per kid is all nneded for sticky, messy fingers and mouths.	&&&
Love the disinfecting lemon scented wipes! I use them mainly in the kitchen for cleaning and sanitizing counter tops and cabinets, inside the microwave!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes!!!! I don't use full strengrh clorox due to the strong smell. I love the fresh scent of the wipes!	&&&
"I never review products, but I had to after yesterday in my backyard. My daughter and I sat down in her sandbox and immediately faced a cloud of mosquitoes. We wiped some of this stuff on us, and in five minutes, I counted three mosquitoes flying around (but not landing on us). By the time we moved to her swing, they were gone! Natrapel is amazing--and, best of all, no DEET or scary chemicals."	&&&
Cvs brand are just as good or maybe better. These are moist but unless they are on sale I would recommend a less expensive alternative	&&&
I always choose Huggies brands because they are the most reliable when it comes to my child. These wipes are so soft and sensitive I buy them every time we run out. No rashes, no problems. Shes happy, I am happy.	&&&
I like this product more as a skin refresher after a hot day. I tried to use it as a makeup remover, but that was a horrible idea. It burned my eyes, due to the grapefruit. But it is perfect for refreshing the skin. I would not buy this again because I don't have much use for this. But I made the mistake thinking it was a makeup remover.	&&&
I purchased these for my 4 yo & my 2.5 yo being potty trained. There is a pretty neat holder you can purchase that slips onto the toilet paper dispenser without disturbing the t.p. I gave the item a 4 because they tend to rip easily (yuck). However, I was told by a Plummer that their lack of "sturdiness" makes them easier on my pluming. Good for kids; would not recommend for adults.	&&&
love these! I have a messy toddler who gets into everything!! These work wonders for our house and they smell pretty great too!	&&&
I use Clorox disinfecting wipes every day in the kitchen and the bathrooms! They are so convenient and do a very good job!!	&&&
Excellent! Best butt wipes for men hands down! I'll never again use baby wipes	&&&
These work great. I keep them on the kitchen table and wipe off our messes right after we eat.	&&&
I have pet at home and young children. this product is easy and convenient when bi have to get rid of a mess quick.	&&&
good value. always know my things are clean and disinfected.	&&&
I honestly picked these up as an impulse buy when I was in Sephora getting ready for a "carry-on only trip," but I am so glad I did. These changed my perception of skincare. I came back from my trip with clearer, smoother, prettier skin when I deviated from my typical skincare routine and was using these along with the argan oil light as my moisturizer for a much simpler skincare routine. These wipes and my experience with the Argan oil have basically converted me into a Josie Maran believer. I have long battled the frequent, minor breakout that left me between "bad skin" and pretty, clear skin I was satisfied with. I was left believing I needed harsh products after my dermatologist and estheticians frequently recommended salicylic acid, AHA/BHA peels, and harsh exfoliants. However, I was still often left with skin frequently plagued with acne and blackheads. I never thought that something so gentle could resolve my breakouts and leave my skin feeling so smooth and soft. I highly recommend these for travel and even daily skincare use if you are looking for something simple on the go.	&&&
Lemon scented Clorox wipes are my go to for a quick bathroom clean-up before company arrives. I have a container in every bathroom...and the kitchen!	&&&
Love these wipes.	&&&
I am so sad that they just changed these wipes. They used to be the best! Larger, thicker, and more moist than any other brand. Now they are thin, normal sized and dryer than other brands. I'm so disappointed. I also think they should list this as a new product rather than use the old link. It's very misleading when you repurchase a whole new thing. Also all of the reviews up until very recently are not accurate, as they are for a different product!	&&&
Great during flu season	&&&
My friend bought one that was more expensive. This one was inexpensive, easy to put together and use. tile shined	&&&
i love using clorox wipes. easy convenient and quick to clean up messes and disinfect	&&&
I would recommend to anyone for their cleaning needs	&&&
i love using the lemon wipes because it leaves a nice fresh scent when im done. Makes me feel like i cleaned more than i did.	&&&
This is an excellent product. Never use anything else!	&&&
love these wipes have them in every room, quick and easy clean up with them	&&&
The Kirkland Signature Wipes do a super job. It is used on my father who is disabled and also for many other uses (like when my grand-kids come to visit) and they ARE FLUSHABLE!	&&&
I have used this product for years and found it to be worth every penny. Whites are brighter and the cleaning value is high.	&&&
Clorox is a clean smelling disinfectant that I use on a daily basis to clean my entire home. I use it in both my kitchen and bath and on door handles and other germy surfaces.	&&&
I love these wipes! i keep them everywhere... in my kitchen, bathroom, car! it is such a Great Product!!!!	&&&
These are my "go to" cleaner for my bathroom sinks and counter. Black sinks seemed like a good idea at the time, but they need to be wiped daily so you don't see the toothpaste. Fortunately, Clorox wipes make this a breeze! They save my sinks and my sanity!	&&&
love clorox it makes everything smell and look so much cleaner	&&&
love the wipes, they get the job done! easy to use and smells nice. will recommended to friends.	&&&
I looked all over for the individually-wrapped version of the most popular flushable brand, and when I found them they were outrageously expensive. These fit the bill just right for travelers.	&&&
To anyone that has limited time I would always recommend these wipes. They smell great and get the job done fast.	&&&
I love these wipes because they are quick and easy to use. The lemon scent is my absolute favorite!	&&&
I love clorox! it works amazing! i would definitly recommend it to anyone who wants cheap and good products!!	&&&
These wipes are so easy to use and convenient to have at home, car and the office.	&&&
I have a toddler son and Clorox wipes have become a staple in my household. I keep a container in my bathrooms, kitchen and car because my toddler explores the world with his mouth and the Clorox wipes are convenient and disinfects with one wipe.	&&&
love using this clorox wipes , easy to use and deodorizes everything	&&&
I use Clorox® Disinfecting Wipes (Lemon) for cleaning my kitchen countertops and after cooking. Love them they are the best	&&&
I have 3 children and I have tried all brands of wipes. Nothing beats Huggies Natural Care!! The wipes are thick and perfectly saturated, great for sensitive skin. Wouldn't ever try another brand of wipes and recommend them to anyone!!!	&&&
I love the fresh lemon smell while cleaning. I use them daily to wipe down countertops in the kitchen and batrooms, clean faucets, wipe down phones, light switches refrigerator handles,cupboard handles and any place I think there might be germs. They are so easy and convenientt to use and everything smells so fresh and looks so clean..Love them.	&&&
This has been the best disinfecting wipe .... Doesn't leave your hands feeling dried out, itchy, sticky or an overpowering smell of cleaning chemicals	&&&
i love the disinfecting wipes! i use the wipes all the time for cleaning all of my kids toys! super fast cleaning and kills germs!	&&&
Love the lemon scent wipes makes my house smell clean!!!	&&&
I Love the Clorox disinfecting wipes! They are so handy to keep around for easy clean ups in a pinch! No hassels. Just easy to clean up and throw away!	&&&
Clorox wipes clean up all messes. I use them at home, in my car and at work!	&&&
These are great around the house It helps with kids to do a quick clean up after a mess. Easy to use and usually reasonable price	&&&
I love cleaning with these wipes but I've learned I have to follow them with a paper towel to gather the wet dust that they leave behind. I love the lemon smell the best."	&&&
I can never find a bag of these locally. It is so much more economical to buy it at Amazon. We always carry these with us --- in my purse, in the glove compartment, in a carry-on bag.	&&&
Love these wipes, and the convenience of buying them here. I always hate shopping for this stuff in public. These are soft and non-irritating, even with the light scent (which is often a problem for me). These are a must have.	&&&
Love this product, its the only one that is sold that doesn't have aloe, aloe vera or aloe leaf in them. love the texture and the fresh scent.	&&&
Pampers sensitive wipes are fantastic! My grandson would break out using other wipes. I love the softness and quality of these wipes. I highly recommend these wipes!	&&&
"I love these wipes. The container is plastic and resealable so that the wipes don't dry out like some of the packs with the tape lid. The wipes are strong and hold up all throughout the house where I use them.

I like know that these have sanitizing power and I can use them to make sure my animals and my family are safe. I use these in the kitchen on my faucet and sink knobs, as well as in the sink. I like to know things are sanitary after I rinse things off like plates that have held chicken. I also like using these on my door knobs when someone is sick.

These go anywhere a spray could and would go. I can use them to wipe the toilet seat and handle down after someone is sick and I can even use them to wipe around the bathtub. I would rather be safe than sorry. The smell of these isn't too bad so I don't feel like I'm going to choke while cleanign with them. They hold up after lots of scrubbing in whatever room I am in and I can just throw them away one they get dirty."	&&&
We are a cloth diapering family who also uses cloth wipes so we rarely ever have disposable wipes on hand. We got these to have to wipe my sons messy face and they work great! They don't dry out as much as disposable diaper wipes have for me either. They also have a very pleasant smell. "	&&&
It makes cleaning and disinfecting quick as well as simple when you're on the go. I use these in my kitchen and bathroom primarily."	&&&
"Like other reviewers, no way would I use this product on a baby due to questionable ingredients. I bought them as hand wipes to keep in the RV and on my sailboat, both have limited fresh water available. For that purpose they are pretty good.
They smell nice. That's good for adults, who cares if your baby's butt smells like cucumber? Besides, it aint gonna smell that way for long!"	&&&
"pampes wipes have always worked on my children and they continue to work. I have a 2 year old daughter and she puts the pampers wipes to the test from drawing on walls to writing on herself.. they work for everything
Thanks Pampers"	&&&
Had to cancel subscription. New formulation of Wipes were a major down grade. Used to be the best I had ever used. Now they are down with the worst ones.	&&&
Was looking for alcohol-free hand wipes for my cubicle and another brand seems to be discontinued or impossible to find in stores or on-line - these are a good alternative.	&&&
These are all over my house. It makes it so easy to wipe surfaces and keep my house clean	&&&
Raw irritated rubbing of bum soothed by this product.	&&&
I love that they are chemical free and so strong.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
So far my favorite wipes. Much preferred over Huggies, and also better than Pampers IMO. They are sturdy, but very flexible. Hold up and wipe well. Effective for getting into creases and folds of skin.	&&&
These wipes are perfect for delicate baby skin. No perfume smell and soft to feel	&&&
Love these wipes! These wipes remove so much makeup, including my matte liquid lipstick that I would have so much trouble removing! Definitely would buy them again!	&&&
I usually love huggie wipes, but I was disappointed with these they were almost dry. Trying a different kind next.	&&&
Use it monthly on leather furniture. Leather is soft.	&&&
Thought I'd happened on a real bargain, but I envisioned different size container. The wipes themselves are fresh and in good condition, and of course do what they were purchased to do. My 3 stars is for the price/size in order, not quality of product.	&&&
"I was able to try via free samples: Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes - free of alcohol, fragrances, parabens and dyes, and with the performance and comfort of cloth. Join the new #GenerationGood community and you might be selected to try products too! www.generationgood.net. #FreeSample

I tried these when my baby was first born - and found them to be a bit thin - but the thickness/strength of these seems to have improved and that was a great feature! My only concern now is still some of the ingredients. But compared to what we buy now - these are the next best thing as far as quality and price!"	&&&
I absolutely LOVE these wipes. I am reducing the toxic products that I bring into my home, and these wipes are perfect for replacing wipes! I've made the recipes that use paper towels, but those towels are still rough on the face and not very sturdy when using on tough cleanup areas. These wipes are not only super sturdy, they are super soft. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Added bonus is that they are environmentally friendly! :-)	&&&
I seriously love these wipes. They are a great, very stretchy wipe. They smell FANTASTIC! My daughter has extremely sensitive skin (very easily gets diaper rash and very eczema prone) and these wipes works wonders without any reaction. I also think that it is a great deal. I mean, with the quality of baby wipe that you are getting, and the price you are paying... it's a mom win for sure.	&&&
Easy to access and use. The wipes seem to do a good job of removing the oil and refreshing the mask. Unfortunately they can be very difficult to set up for dispensing and also frequently fall back into the case requiring you to dig around through the center of all of the wipes to get them set back up for dispensing again which can lead to contaminating the undispensed wipes.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes because the are so easy and convenient to use and plus they smell great!	&&&
I like these wipes. We were using disposable wipes on our cloth diapered baby. It's amazing how fast the cost of the disposable wipes adds up! These will save us a lot of money in the future. They are very soft and serve the purpose. I do wish they were a little more absorbent, but according to other reviews, it looks like that will improve the more they are washed. They've only been washed a handful of times so far.	&&&
I've bought about 8 of these since my little guy was 1. We go through them! Don't bother with the little packets that you have to peel back every time. This is the way to go. Worth every penny.	&&&
The only disinfectant wipes used in my house are Clorox wipes. With my 5 little monsters running around during cold and flu season, I never have to worry about them getting sick. One swipe with a Clorox wipe and I'm confident the germs are gone.	&&&
I love cleaning my kitchen and bathrooms with the wipes and toilet products	&&&
I LOVE Clorox brand. I can always count on the product to do it's job and then some! It leaves me feeling like my house is disinfected, cleaned throughly and germ free! I use just about every product that the have throughout my entire home! I won't use any other brand! Thank you!	&&&
"Really cute to have in your desk but don't seem to clean an much as i wanted them too but they are very handy to have for your phone or tablets"	&&&
The power of Windex in a handy wipe. These packets do not take up much space and they come in very handy to wipe the windows on the front and back doors of our retail store.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting wipes are convenient and effective.	&&&
I use the wipes in my household daily. Great for cleaning up every day messes and disinfecting my home.	&&&
I love these wipes! we use them for everything, they always leave the kitchen smelling fresh!	&&&
"These wipes worked just fine. They're pretty thick, remain fairly moist, and have gentle ingredients. (I should note, though, that our son doesn't have very sensitive skin--he doesn't get a rash with the non-sensitive varieties of wipes, either.)

We found we could get a pretty good deal on these through Subscribe and Save/Amazon.com, especially when there's also a manufacturer's coupon to use."	&&&
I do really like them, but there are more cost effective ones that work just fine at the lcoal drug store and they are cheaper and have more wipes in them. I do find when I use any of them consistently I break out pretty bad, so use with caution.	&&&
I love using Clorox Wipes on just about everything my kids touch. They are so easy to use and I know that I am not only removing any dirt or stains, but I am also disinfecting.	&&&
I like Clorox wipes because they are convenient and smell good.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting lemon wipes are great to use. Disinfects and smells fresh.	&&&
Love clorox wipes. love clorox brand. Buy them all the time	&&&
Slightly better than advertised. Judging from the feel, they appear to have more witch hazel on them than Preparation H wipes.	&&&
I love these wipes. I just use them everyday for daily cleaning and sanitizing.	&&&
smells amazing , very soft , very gentle, thick , it has lotion so my baby's skin won't dry.	&&&
Love these for easy or moderate cleaning. I have them at work, in the kitchen, & bath. Great product to always keep on hand. They can dry out so keep them tightly closed.	&&&
Like this wipes coz it has the right amount of wetness. Right sized wipes. Right thickness. Good price.	&&&
I appreciate the concept behind purse friendly, natural wipes, but these are kind of a pain to get out of the packaging. Not a deal breaker, but not five star worthy either.	&&&
Love Clorox especially the disinfecting wipes- which I use at home and at the office!	&&&
This box lasted 5 months! It's by far the best way to buy wipes!	&&&
LOVE! My Clorox wipes! Especially for easy clean up, disinfecting and my stainless steal appliances!	&&&
Love Clorox Disinfecting wipes! So easy to use, and cleans up quickly! Leaves my kitchen clean and smelling lemon fresh!	&&&
This is a great buy especially with Prime Membership and free shipping.	&&&
Isabel, I have 6 children and kids spread lots of germs having clorox around helps with keeping eveyone healthy and surfaces clean.	&&&
I love Clorox products. I have a five year old and I'm always cleaning. I especially love the wipes. They are convenient and I use them in every room. Great product!	&&&
Love the clorox wipes!! so east to use and clean with. i use them to wipe down my baseboards at my house and to clean up after my kids.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting wipes are super easy to use & make everything smell great.	&&&
The disinfecting wipes are perfect for quick clean ups, especially with a toddler in the household	&&&
Thinking about easy and fast cleaning makes Clorox wipes the perfect cleaning tool!	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting wipes, especially the lemon scent. It cleans surfaces very well and is very convenient.	&&&
We love, love, love this dispenser for saving us wipes that were coming out 2-3 at a time before. I love that it's entirely one handed and easy to reload. We bought the more expensive natural wipes from WaterWipes and Kinder By Nature and they were very difficult to remove from the package and this were using more than we needed when they were clumping out of the wipes sleeve. This dispenser solved our problem and is great when holding baby's feet up and you need another wipe but don't want to put baby's feet down into a diaper mess. Highly recommended and worth the price.	&&&
I absolutely swear by Neutrogena Hydrating Makeup Remover Wipes (turquoise package) and this just isn't in the same ballpark. It works but you really need to work at that waterproof mascara to get it off, and possibly lose a few lashes in the process. Decided to try something new but going back to Neutrogena.	&&&
I have always been careful of my personal hygen and decided to buy the Cottonelle flushable wipes for me and my kids to use . We started to use it for a week and I notice my 5years old daughter started complaining that her vaginal and butt feels burning and itching . At first I thought that she might wipe wrong, then me and my older daughter started having the same thing.the burning and itching was so bad that we had to go see the doctor and get some test done . It turns out that there is chemical allergic reaction that we had from using the Conttelle flushable wipe . I I will NEVER EVER AGAIN buy that or any other wipes from now on I will only use water and mild soap .	&&&
Works great and arrived so quickly!	&&&
Love using these bleach wipes. They are easier and less messy than gross sponges.	&&&
"dust, dust everywhere. these wipes are handy for cleaning & occasional sprucing. the wipes are solid almost like cloth with a waxy feel. the microfiber weave pulls up dirt readily. i wiped tables, chairs both inside & outside and it picked up dirt even where it didn't look dirty.

this almost makes cleaning fun."	&&&
I love using Clorox Wipes, They smell great and I feel like everything is clean after using them. Thank you for a great product.	&&&
I love these wipes, I use the for everything!! I highly recommend them!	&&&
I love using Clorox products to keep my family and home healthy.	&&&
i love using clorox because it does such a wonderful cleaning job and i dont ever have to worry if something is clean or not	&&&
I have been using clorox wipes for a few years now and I can honestly say I use them for everything! I can't go without buying them.	&&&
great all purpose cleaning supplies"}},	&&&
These are the only wipes I use. They are a bit more pricey, and you can buy generics for much cheaper. The name of these wipes holds true, you need only a couple of these to get the job done.	&&&
Clorox Wipes are simply the best on the market. I highly recommend.	&&&
best wipes around! i use them to clean all my daughters toys and to clean my counter tops	&&&
Clorox wipes are the only disinfecting wipes I will purchase because I am confident to have the job done	&&&
I love the Clorox pen and the wipes! we use the wipes on a daily basis in our home. We just love them!!!	&&&
I was a BIG fan of Pampers wipes when my child was a baby and I don't know what happened but it seems that the manufacturing process has changed this last year. These wipes actually irritate my child's skin more now. My kid was telling me it was "burning" on his skin and I did not understand and fair enough, when I tried them to wipe my face, I had the same tingling sensation. I had to use the stock I had purchased, so we are using them only to wipe our hands. But no more Pampers sensitive or not sensitive wipes for us anymore.	&&&
I really like this item it does such a good job for the task I have to do	&&&
I like these wipes because they are strong. I have never had one rip while cleaning up a baby bottom. They are also gentle enough that my little one never has any irritation. Sometimes the refill packs come with a plastic container and sometimes they don't, so you should hold onto a wipe container in case your next delivery does not come with one.	&&&
I HAVE CLEANING ADD, I HAVE TO KEEP A CLEAN FRESH HOME, AND THIS PRODUCT HELPS ME DO THAT!	&&&
We've been using these wipes for the last 3 months and have a six month subscription. We're using these wipes in connection with colostomy bag application. They don't leave any residual mater and are excellent for use when the skin is the least bit chapped or red. They are also excellent for other sensitive skin areas. We just can't say enough good about these wipes!!!!	&&&
My husband and I really like the Pamper Sensitive Wipes. They are capable of cleaning baby up and can be safely used to clean baby's hands, feet, and back for those extra messy occasions. It is easy to pull the wipes out for use, but we recommend having a few pulled out and ready because if you rush when removing the wipes more than four can come out at once, which is a waste. Overall, these wipes get the job done and make baby happy!	&&&
These are great in the kitchen!!! I use them to clean the counters.	&&&
Cleans great and smells so good! We love Clorox Wipes!	&&&
I've tried many wipes before but these are the WINNER...:-)!!!	&&&
Clorox wipes are perfect for an easy clean up and disinfectent. The lemon sent is just a bonus since it does not have a harsh chemical smell.	&&&
clorox wipes are very convenient and I love how they smell.	&&&
"I love these Dust Wipes. Dusting is something I often put off doing because I never want to take the time to spray and wipe, spray and wipe. These wipes make it so much faster and easier.

These wipes are very easy to use. You simply pull one out of the box and wipe your desired area. No spraying anything or having to get the wipes damp or anything like that. Grab, wipe and dispose.

I think the size of these wipes are really good. They measure 7 x 8.5 inches. One wipe can hold an impressively good amount of dust.

I was quite surprised by how far one wipe could go. The wipes really locks all the dust and hair into the wipe rather than just pushing it to the side. It does an incredible dust job.

These wipes are non-abrasive so they won't do any damage. I can't think of anywhere I wouldn't use them. Anywhere that collects dust, I've used these and they work great.

I love these wipes and would highly recommend them."	&&&
The cleaning wipes work well and the cleaning duster works well	&&&
Fairly decent wipes.	&&&
Quick to grab and clean on the go! Awesome product!	&&&
I am loving the new Huggies Clutch ‘n’ Clean* wipes they are natural care wipes that are in a stylish clutch, that you can carry around in your diaper bag and easily refill them.	&&&
These wipes are useless. They simply do not work. I have better luck with Kirkland brand baby wipes at a tiny fraction of the cost of these tissue paper wipes.	&&&
I have tried a couple other brands and types of wipes, but these are the best! They are thick, and wipe up all sorts of messes. I use them for my infant, as well as my older daughter. I buy the big box and refill my containers when needed. They smell better than some of the wipes I have used, and do not leave a slimey feeling like others. They might cost a little bit more than others, but completely worth it! "	&&&
"I picked these up because it has become extremely hard to purchase the product we had been purchasing. We love, love, love these wipes. The aloe & vitamin E is so soothing. The packs are very well sealed so they do not leak or dry out. The size is perfect for my husband to slip a few in his pocket and he always has something available. These are a wonderful product for almost any reason. I keep a few in my purse and even have some stowed away at work. I don't want to be without them EVER!
I have even shared them with my best friend because she was in need, and told me this morning she is ordering a bunch of boxes too. I highly recommend trying these out. They are 1000 times better than the best baby wipes available and much more convenient."	&&&
Clean, natural and the wipes don't tear too easily. Unscented wipes ensure less irritation. I've used these wipes for years.	&&&
I couldn't wait to order these wipes after a friend recommended them. I was experiencing a bit more streaking with the liquid stainless steel products than I was happy with, unless I spent lots of time wiping over and over. These wipes are great! One sheet will clean the side by side refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, and stainless steel gas range and oven beautifully and will still have cleansing power left (your choice to discard the sheet or save under the plastic container's lid). I do strongly recommend that you carefully read the directions for removing the clear interior plastic and how to properly pull the wipes out of the container for an 'easier start'. I hope you like these wipes as much as I do!	&&&
I don't have much to compare these to considering they are the only wipes we've used since my baby was born (8 mos. old now). When I was researching natural wipes they were really the only ones that were really "all natural." We have had no issues. The price may be a little more than your Pampers or Huggies, but the old adage goes "you get what you pay for." I would highly recommend them to anyone who cares about the chemicals they are using on their baby's bodies. They smell great, work great, and leave my baby girl fresh as can be. Thank you for providing a product that I am happy to reorder over and over again.	&&&
I received a free sample of this product from Smiley360 , and after using the first wipe , I had relief. The wipes sre easy to use , conveient to put in your handbag and not messy. The wipes are made from natural ingredients , such as: cucumber , aloe and chamomile....extremely soothing and cooling. I highly recommend using PreparationH Medicated Wipes .	&&&
I received this wonderful product as a free sample from Smiley360 as a mission to try and review.These wipes are fantastic and much nicer than the original Preparation H wipes. They smell nicer and feel better and are very soothing. I'm glad Preparation H thought about a woman's gentler needs when they developed their new wipes. I'm never buying the original ones again.	&&&
I like the pampers sensitive diapers so I bought the wipes as well. They are a good deal, but leave a slimy residue both on baby and on our hands. I feel like I always need to wash my hands after touching one so they're not great for out and about. Also I don't like the sliminess on baby's bottom either. Now we have to get through the whole case.	&&&
We love Boogie Wipes. So gentle on our daughter's nose. Though they are quite large for a child's nose, so we use it and fold it and reuse it a few times before we throw it out. The scented ones are strong, so we only use the unscented ones.	&&&
I enjoy the convenience, ease and quality of Clorox wipes.	&&&
I use Clorox for everything. The wipes are handy and can be used a so many things. I live clorox	&&&
I love this product! The wipes are individually wrapped, fit discreetly in my purse or pocket and they are cruelty free! They are not harmful to the environment and this company gives back! You will not be disappointed if you buy these wipes.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes! So easy to use in the kitchen or bathroom for a quick clean up.	&&&
Love these wipes! They are so convenient and easy to use.	&&&
To me Clorox is synonymous to cleanliness so having disinfectant wipes made by Clorox gives me peace of mind that the area that I wiped down is clean and bacteria-free.	&&&
I LOVE this product! We received one as a gift when I was pregnant and looking back it was hands down one of my favorite baby items. I now give one to all expecting moms as a baby shower gift, it's that important lol. Seriously though, this thing just works. It has the weight that holds the wipes down so you only get one at a time, it keeps the wipes moist until the last one, it looks nice sitting on a dresser or changing table. If you're having a baby you need one of these!	&&&
The clorox wipes are quick and easy to use and leave a very fresh scent behind. Great for moms of little kids!!	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. They are such a convenient way to disinfect my kitchen counters.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They disinfect and are easy to use!	&&&
I love to have these on hand for the office or home. They work perfect for windows, mirrors and anything else. I don't like using sprays when I don't have to, so these are great!"}},	&&&
These wipes are great! I bring my tablet to work and others use it, as soon as I get in the car, I wipe it down and it's nice and clean with no fingerprints! They are great to use on everything! I use them on my cell phone, on my computer and my tablet. They are very convenient! I have them in my desk, car and purse. I had to take them off my desk because everyone is obsessed with them and are constantly taking them! I highly recommend them if you want them for a quick wipe down and make your device like new!"}},	&&&
I love how Clorox Disinfecting Wipes cleans and leaves a lovely lemon scent	&&&
awesome products really great in all rooms of home	&&&
I want to like this item, but the latching mechanism broke after less than a year of use, and now the unit has to be stored upside down or else it stays open all day. Open = dry, ineffective wipes. I tried to return it for a non-defective model, but didn't meet the returns window. You're probably better off getting the "free" container that comes with premium wipes (we got Pampers sensitive) bulk boxes.	&&&
GREAT if you have kids and to disinfect fast and easy to use	&&&
Love these wipes. They get the job done without hurting a baby tush! Other wipes tend to make my babies raw. These are the only wipes I have found to clean well and keep skin the way it should be	&&&
Good product, I will recommend this product to my friends and family.	&&&
A beautiful solution to a common problem.	&&&
Clorox wipes are super convenient and a great cleaning option. This is our go to product for quick cleanup of messes and disinfecting.	&&&
I love them! I work in a public school and constantly use them to wipe up the germs! So convenient.	&&&
clorox wipes clean, disinfects, deodorizes what more could you ask for i personally love the smell it smells cleans and kills most of the germs	&&&
I absolutely adore the scrubbing Clorox wipes! I know it's a strong cleaner, it disinfects, easy to use, easy to store. There are NO negatives with this product!	&&&
Great product. Reasonable size, smells great and easy to use on the go. Wished if it came in larger quantity at cheaper price. Would buy again.	&&&
i use clorox wipes every day. great for disinfecting and kills germs. so convenient to use.the lemon scent smells great.	&&&
Works great. Only downside is the light. Trying to keep the baby's room dark and there's that darn lit up heart. Put him down, eyes open, staring straight at it! I had to turn it so it is up against the bookcase wall. Other than that it keeps the wipes warm and wet. You do need to use the sponge and replace it so they don't get musty. I haven't had a problem with that at all but I've been diligent about using distilled water and keeping the sponge moist. A little browning occurs on the last few wipes sometimes. Overall works well for our cloth wipes.	&&&
They are great to wipe anything!!!"}},	&&&
"Good for cleaning. is so convenient, easy to use and smell good.
I bought it for my mom that has alzheimer.
Jannette"	&&&
I love these wipes! They work tremendously and leaves my home smelling and looking great.	&&&
I love Clorox disinfecting wipes because they're so convenient and easy to use. With a messy husband, child and dog there's always something dirty or gross about to happen. Clorox disinfecting wipes make cleanup so much simpler.	&&&
"I love these wipes..
we use them many times per day"	&&&
I like the overall quality, but what I don't like is the pieces of lint it leaves behind if I wipe too much with the wipe and the scent smells funny mixed with the body heat with baby after a while after diaper change.	&&&
I've used other brands of bleach wipes in the past, but none smell as good as Clorox and don't seem to ever clean as well! These are great for use int he kitchen and in the bathroom!	&&&
"Love this product. Great for kids with allergies or highly prone to runny nose."	&&&
Clorox wipes are great in the kitchen and bathroom!	&&&
Love these wipes. easy cleanup. Always buy them for the kids teachers at school. The love them	&&&
Hate these wipes! They tear so easily. Going back to Pampers Sensitive.	&&&
these wipes are really bad, they rip easily i dont recommend these	&&&
"I use these Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for many applications in my house such as cleaning toilets, floors, sink, floor, counter tops, tables, my daughter's toys etc. The strong point is that these wipes are very wet and not semi-wet like other disinfecting wipes. The 'Fresh Scent' gives my house a clean smell and kills about 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. Also, removing the wipes from the container is hassle free and easy to remove, and the lid stays on tight to preserve the wipes from drying out.

I recommend the Clorox Wipes over the competition since they are more moist and cost effective from a company you can trust."	&&&
These are great! Clean up is fast and easy plus it sanitizes as well. I cant do without them at work. When your through...just throw them away.	&&&
Bought these wipes to clean up a Miniature Poodle puppy, especially his back end because he hasn't been groomed yet so stuff gets stuck on his fur. The smell is really pleasant, and the wipes are nice and thick. Great for cleaning dirty paws after coming in from outside. Would buy again.	&&&
I love how soft the wipes are, I strongly dislike the scent. The child already has a runny nose, he does not need to inhale perfume.	&&&
They roll as you try to use them.	&&&
"We have owned 3 of these, and 2 have failed in the same way. If you drop it from a couple feet up while the lid is closed, one of the plastic tabs inside the latch breaks off, and the lid will no longer stay closed. The first time this happened, OXO was great. We sent them a picture of the broken latch and they mailed us out a new one for free. We also bought another one for use a second location. Since then, one of the 2 replacements broke in the same way. We are not especially hard on our stuff, one of the drops was even onto a thick pile carpet.

The product is otherwise PERFECT. Easy to load, always pulls out 1 wipe at a time, good seal on the lid to keep wipes from drying out, great capacity, and it's cute!

While it's great that OXO sent us out a replacement, and stands behind their product, the latch needs a redesign before I can recommend it."	&&&
"I just started using these, I bought them based on the price and that they were natural/non toxic. They are good wipes, they get the job done which is what matters most after the fore-mentioned. They are kinda thin, but does not affect its ability to clean bottoms."	&&&
Smells and works wonders specially babies/ toddlers that don't like their nose touched. an easy swipe	&&&
Great. But since the wipes are attached, I sometimes end up pulling a few out at a time.	&&&
My family uses these wipes regularly. We normally buy the large refill kits for at home, but these are the way to go for traveling. My child has semi-sensitive skin (way less sensitive than my own) and it doesn't bother her at all (or my hands for that matter). I know everyone is different but fire us, these work great.	&&&
These are super soft and big enough to keep my hands clean while changing a diaper mess. They are two sided. The color side is a a tad more textured and the white side is super soft. These seem well constructed. However, I am giving them 3 stars because when I try to wipe my baby the two layers slide on one another and makes it difficult to clean him. I would suggest they consider using a soft thread to stitch down the center to keep the layers together. The are almost like pillows with no stuffing, if you can imagine that. I had more success with my homemade flannel wipes which are made the exact same way ( double layer and zigzag/surged around the edge) but the flannel layers don't slide on each other and are far more absorbing in my opinion. So, my final opinion: good, not great.	&&&
These are the best wipes out there. One wipe does the job.	&&&
I love using Clorox products. It whitens, disinfects,removes stain and deodorizes the house to make everything fresh. I uses it just about in every room in my house. Clorox is most definitely a powerful cleaning product.	&&&
"This is an excellent value for the money!

Previously, I purchased a small box (20 or 25 ct.) of wipes from a local eyeglass wear store for $5.99. I got four or five times the amount for approx. $10.

I grabbed a handful and placed it in my backpack. One just never knows hwen you need a towelette to clean off your eyeglass wear. I gave a bunch to the wife to put in her purse. We both tested them out and found them to be very saitsfactory and serves the purpose. I've also used it to wipe off the face of my iPad and iPhone.

PRO: Great value, easy to use, great for cleaning off the front of the smartphone and tablet
CONS: None noted."	&&&
I love Clorox wipes, they do a great job and are so convenient. I have them in each of my bathrooms. They really do a great job if I need to quickly sanitize anything.	&&&
my child has eczema and would break out in a rash very easily. These wipes don't make her break out. Still use them all the time even though she is potty trained.	&&&
"""I use this product on my son Brent!

He's a newborn and even though he can't speak I am very sure that he loves it.

Before he would cry every time i changed his diaper because when I wiped him the wipes were ice cold!



I feel that it is a great product.

I like the light it has also because I can find it easy at night and the room is not pitch black."""	&&&
These are great little packs of wipes. They are small enough packs so they wont get dried out before you are able to use them all and they are easily able to fit into your purse with ease. They clean your hands and surfaces with ease and It makes me feel comfortable that they are clean. I really like the small packs that they come in they are very convenient and it comes with enough packs to have them anywhere you need. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.	&&&
most of the wipes seemed like they were dried out?	&&&
Good pampers wipes to us on your baby	&&&
"These are great for wiping down all kinds of surfaces. I use them in the kitchen, the bathroom and various other places to help keep germs at bay."	&&&
My mom started me on using this product and i love it! love that it makes the house smell fresh and clean and it disinfects at the same time.	&&&
I like the size of the packaging. It really is great for travel. And I like that it is TSA friendly. I received this product for a deep discount in exchange for my non-biased opinion.	&&&
Love these little wipes. They are perfect for quick dusting / cleaning in my office."}},	&&&
This product gets all of my surfaces cleaned perfectly!	&&&
some of the wipes are completely dry	&&&
"Sleek look, good functionality. Doesn't burn the wipes or dry them like similar products. The little nightlight helps. Out of all products for the price it's worth it."	&&&
Love Pampers wipes. Use them for the baby as well as taking make-up off. They are great for everything. Even use them to wipe the dogs feet.	&&&
I really like how these wipes were saturated in the liquid. They weren't soaking wet but not anywhere near dry either. They were perfect. However, what I did not care for was the smell. They have a sour smell. I use them for my pug's paws and also on her facial folds. The paws aren't so bad but these wipes make her smell sour, when she clearly isn't, after we wipe her facial folds. For the most part, they did what they are advertised to do. I just couldn't stand the sour smell so I won't be purchasing again.	&&&
Work great but pricy.	&&&
Nice value, fits in purse, takes up little space on end table or desk. Product info on shelf tag was incorrect however product description on the price tag said 100 ct. but product is only 60 ct. I brought it to the store Manager's attention and he thanked me. I don't know if he fixed it though."}},	&&&
Although these wipes may be cheaper than other brands available on the market, they do not hold up well and give my baby a rash. Even the sensitive, fragrance free Huggies are no good.	&&&
"Always have used this product especially the lemon one. Easy to use and carry as well."	&&&
Love these wipes. Would highly recommend to anyone.	&&&
It is a Great product which beat competition a hands down . i used other products but Clorox gives me more satisfaction than any ,	&&&
Love them, they are so easy to use! & with a new puppy we are using tons!!!!	&&&
DO NOT WORK! I purchased two packages for our trip to Jamaica last week. Applied them as directed and the first time we used them my husband complained of the strong noxious smell from the wipe, and I hated it too. We learned to apply the wipes starting lower down, with feet and legs and working our way up on exposed areas. However, this was all for naught as I just came home and am covered in bites, my husband not so much, but he never gets as many as me. In one small area just above the back of my knee, I have 6 bites alone. Many more all over my legs, feet, hands, arms and neck.	&&&
Very EASY a great clean and convenient product. To use very durable and last.	&&&
With 2 toddlers at home, it seems like every surface is constantly sticky. These wipes not only help me protect my family from germs, it helps me keep my home clean and smelling good. The "fresh" scent is my favorite, I love the smell, its light and not at all overpowering.	&&&
Love these, great for carrying in your purse, car or your home. I use them every day.	&&&
Well, this wipes are not the softest but they're kind of okay. An okay wipe if on the low end of money and really need wipes.	&&&
I love the texture of Pampers wipes and the fact that they are not soaking wet like other leading brands....	&&&
Easy to use and apparently tasty. Excellent for kiddos with only a few teeth to tend to.	&&&
These wipes are impresively effective to clear the baby's smells from the face, neck and hands. I really like the smell also.	&&&
These wipes works fairly for its price, it's just unable to ged rid of stains that are hard to remove.	&&&
I was thankful to find Huggies wipes as they felt like cotton and less static than some brands. But I won't be buying them any more as they do rip and when you try to get one out of the packet, they are so small that several come out at once. I use them to clean my rabbits and guinea-pig and their cages. Huggies were a lovely size and more firm and didn't rip so did a great job but NOW that they have reduced the size and quality and put the price up, I won't be using them as it results in me getting my hands all covered in stuff from their cages. I'd not use them on babies either as can't see how they would clean up the mess without ripping and are not like the larger sanitary ones that wiped everything without turning into a sticky mess. No thanks Huggies, you have ruined your wipes and it seems like most people won't be buying them any more. Soon they'll be like a postage stamp size as they are steadily reducing the size and thinking we won't notice. We are not fools.	&&&
This wipes are perfect when it comes to cleaning my table I love the clean smell that it leaves. Cleaning door knobs and dirty walls specially with 2 little ones I need this in my closet.	&&&
very good product! it cleans and doesnt leave streaks	&&&
Love the lemon ones. Does the job awesome	&&&
Great product!! Very good prices and I just love the functionality of all Clorox products. I use them all the time. With a 2 and 9 year old, this product is beyond useful. and it makes me feel good to know, that whatever I'm cleaning will actually be clean.	&&&
These wipes work really well and he absolutely loves them!	&&&
"these wipes clean the monitor screen very well. i like that the wipes come in this nice packaging. it looks good enough to leave out in full view. great price."	&&&
This is the only brand of wipes i can use on my skin. always works and smells great!	&&&
The ingredients are not 100% great but they are better than most wipes. The wipes are made in UK which is great. The wipes are nice and big. The packaging needs some work. The closing flap on the packaging tears off easily, after half way through the package it falls off and the wipes dry out quick. I have to put them in a plastic bag to keep them from drying out. The main reason why I gave them only 3 stars is because both of my kids get a mild rash after prolonged use. I will be switching to a different brand.	&&&
There are websites that state that harmful chemicals in these wipes but they are all false claims. These wipes are durable, soft, great smelling and you usually only have to use one to get the job done. Your baby's skin will look and feel amazing after each diaper. My only negative comment is that it is very pricey, therefore, I abandoned using when my daughter became a toddler.	&&&
These wipes are terrible. They are not very strong. I have to use twice as many because they tear and fall apart. They don't wipe smoothly and they rip easily. Gross! They also leave a lot of fibers behind. These are truly the worst baby wipes I have used.	&&&
Perfect and sturdy and holds just the right amount of wipes. If I could I would even make it slightly bigger! LOL	&&&
These wipes are thick and strong as they advertise. There are no annoying scents or chemicals. They are just the right size too. 7th Generation does a great job with their wipes. These were better than Earth's Best (too rough), BabyGanics (too weak), and Naty (too small).	&&&
very good , buying second time and will buy in future	&&&
Does the job well. These wipes actually stay wet for a while after opening as well, unlike many other brands.	&&&
leaves streaks on tv and computer	&&&
Used by troops overseas in areas with sand to wash feet before bed. This helps prevent trench foot. Great product.	&&&
These are nice and soft and comes out of the packaging easier than other brands. I do not see any irritation on my son from these and they are wet enough (not like those Huggies wipes)	&&&
"Overall I like it, but once unplugged , the wipes do not stay warm long enough."	&&&
Boggie wipes are excellent. They have a pleasing scent and feel good on your nose. The whole family uses them and it doesn't dry out your skin.	&&&
The Wet Ones are moist and useful to clean body or dust in the house.	&&&
"My sister told me to use them and was she right. My daughter neverminds if I use them on her. I love the smell of them too."	&&&
"I have pretty bad teeth, since I struggled with my teeth forever I wanted to take care of my little one's teeth very well so she doesn't have to go through what I go through.
That being said, I researched what could I do to keep her first teeth and guns clean, and that is only few things available, this wipes are best option in my opinion.
They are not expensive and we use them after bath before bed.
They are in good size so I can wrap them around my finger and clean her teeth and gum without really bothering my daughter."	&&&
WOW.... better than I expected. My husband had hip surgery and could not move around, carrying for him was so much easier having these around. He was very happy to be able to have these wipes to clean his hands and to help keep the area clean of germs. I'd order these again!	&&&
We've been using these for 8 years - so portable and useful! My son has always loved the fresh scent and never fights having his nose and face wiped with them! They are gentle and we love having them handy for all kinds of uses. Always in our cars and my purse.	&&&
What can I say? the wipes do what they need to. The big bonus is that we save more buying them here than anywhere else we have looked.	&&&
THIS PRODUCT WAS PURCHASED BECAUSE IT WAS APPROVED BY GOOD HOUSEKEEPING. I WAS VERY HESITATANT TO PURCHASE A PRODUCT FOR MY NEW GRANIT BUT WITH THISE GUARANTEE IT WAS AN WASY CHOICE. IT IS EASY TO USE. AND WORKS! IT SAVES TIME AND EFFORT IN KEEPING GRANITE LOOKING POLISHED. NO STEP BY STEP PROCEEDURE AND IT CAN BE USED FREQUENTLY."}},	&&&
"The wipes are not the best and they leave a streak, but after using two wipes - it works well."	&&&
my husband likes them. uses them all of the time.	&&&
We only use Huggies brand diapers and wipes. The thick wipes and pleasant smell are a must.	&&&
"Perfect little wipes warmer. Keeps them warm always and even comes with a free night light. Good to have more than one around, specially if you have more than 1 floors."	&&&
Great wipes!	&&&
Love the lemon scent of the wipes. They make everything smell clean and fresh!	&&&
I really like how these wipes were saturated in the liquid. They weren't soaking wet but not anywhere near dry either. They were perfect. However, what I did not care for was the smell. They have a sour smell. I use them for my pug's paws and also on her facial folds. The paws aren't so bad but these wipes make her smell sour, when she clearly isn't, after we wipe her facial folds. For the most part, they did what they are advertised to do. I just couldn't stand the sour smell so I won't be purchasing again.	&&&
Several were dried out. Disappointed.	&&&
They are awesome I would recommend these to all my family and friends.	&&&
These are great wipes. I like the sensitive wipes better but still really good.	&&&
"Does exactly what the title says. Very gentle and so easy to wipe off. Great product."	&&&
I knew I wanted a sensitive wipe when I had my son because I myself have so many skin allergies. I have used Pampers Sensitive wipes on my son since day one, they have been awesome.	&&&
Great bath wipes. My dog is very clean now.	&&&
My younger kids care more about the outside of the box than the actual product. They're thrilled that it's got "Frozen" on it. The wipes are great and are thick enough that you usually just need one.	&&&
We love these gentle wipes because they have no chemicals! Perfect for my kiddos!	&&&
I have been buying Kirkland wipes for years and years. I would've given 5 stars, but they have recently changed the packaging. It is not as good now. When you pull out the wipes, a few come out at a time, instead of just one wipe.	&&&
I use these wonderful wipe to clean up spills that children make and they work GREAT!!!!!!! I LOVE THEM!!!!!	&&&
"Easier to use than the Preparation H because they are packed better. The center folds are more precise and the opening in the package is smaller so it is easier to pick a single sheet rather than accidentially grabbing several at a time.

The material has a slightly differnt feel, but works the tsame. I like them better. I weighed the package and compared the weight with a new Preparation H package. It was slightly lighter, but not by much, but it has smaller amount of plastic in the package lid, so I think it has the same weight paper and the same amount of absorbed liquid.

I also noted that it seems to be a product approved for use in military exchanges and I would expect that their product testing for that would be pretty rigorous.

I worry about long term use in the plumbing. I have a sewer system, and some say that the term 'flushable' is not the same as sewer or septic system safe. I've had no problems so far though after several month's use, but I have a ewer connection."	&&&
Makes tidying up a breeze!! I keep them at my desk at work also!! I have the free scent of Clorox disinfecting wipes!!	&&&
Some of my favorite wipes. They don't smell or leave a oily/film on your Childs bottom. I will continue to purchase these wipes!	&&&
Love this product. Quick and easy to use, and truely cleans and disinfects surfaces. I use wipes regurlay all over my house	&&&
These are the only wipes that we use for our sensitive child. This and Target diapers are the perfect combo.	&&&
Easy to use wipes for your dogs teeth. It works in conjunction with brushing your dogs teeth, as I do not think this product alone would solely restore dogs teeth to their former glory. They might work if you started cleaning your dogs teeth as a young pup, but as the dog gets older and the build up happens you will need to also brush the teeth. I will say it is a great product to use in between brushings as it is only recommended to brush a dogs teeth a few times a week.	&&&
The wipes were frozen when delivered. Once they thawed they work good.	&&&
Awesome Products I use them on everything around the house and office	&&&
I have purchased similar wipes like this before. And you need to skip these altogether. Go look for the Luxury Barber man wipes. Much better product overall and it's the same price. You're welcome.	&&&
I love your wipes, easy and I feel that they clean well, if l can get a good deal on these I will stock up .....	&&&
I love these for convenience. Great price.	&&&
has not completely cleaned as expected"}},	&&&
I use to remove my makeup.	&&&
We have these all over the house because you just never know! Always prepared for anything thanks to Clorox Wipes!!	&&&
My DIL has used these since my grand baby was born. She is allergic to other wipes and these particular ones have never been a problem in two years.	&&&
Love these wipes! I use them all the time and love the fresh scent they leave behind!! I use them to clean in my dorm suite and I always feel a lot better about how I cleaned!	&&&
Our diaper gene would be useless without these. These work great to keep the wipes warm and moist. Without the wipes dry out before we use them all.	&&&
I've got a 92 pound dog who hates baths like nobody's business, but loooooves to snuggle on the couch or in bed. Add in sensitive skin on top of that and you've got yourself a problem. Fortunately a good rubdown with these every few days is totally fine by him, doesn't give him any skin issues, and keeps him smelling and feeling (to the touch, I have no idea how he feels about it lol) MUCH cleaner and fresher. He gets to snuggle, I get a clean puppy, everybody wins! I'm not sure how well these will work as a bath substitute for longer coats (mine's a pibble, it's short and sleek and easy to manage), but even long haired breeds need their paws, faces and other bits wiped down some times.	&&&
There very convenient to have in the diaper bag or purse. They clean any sticky mess up and there good to have out in public when you need to wipe off germs. I always have them with me."	&&&
Pampers Sensitive Wipes are the Best!!! I only buy this brand because my son has very sensitive skin and Pampers are the only wipes that doesn't break his skin out. Pampers are the best wipes EVER! ! :)	&&&
We bought these wipes to go natural and not use the wipes with the toxic ingredients but they are a bit on the stiff side so we mostly use them as hand wipes. Also, when we put them in the wipe warmer or any other wipe dispenser, the wipes don't pull properly so we have to open the dispenser top to get the next wipe.	&&&
I received a sample from Smiley360 and was ecstatic to find enough samples to pass on the friends. The wipes are smooth, moist and smell great. They are flush-able so no issues with backing up the toilet. While i was not experiencing hemorrhoids at the moment, the wipes left me feeling fresh and clean. They can do double duty as feminine wipes and you'll be pleased. Definitely plan to purchase in the future and would recommend even if you don't suffer from hemorrhoids.	&&&
I love huggies wipes! I love that they are easily ripped, not like other brands that are stretchy and weird. It makes it easy to save money and use fewer wipes. And I love that they leave your baby's bum so soft.	&&&
I used these for cleaning the house. I found that the wipes didn't all fit in the container that came with it. The wipes also don't come out of the box easily and I have to keep opening the box to get them out. I am going to be going back to using Luvs brand. Thank you.	&&&
These are a must have in my home. I use them several times a day. Since my mother has been sick it is imperative to keep things clean and disinfected. These make my job a lot easier. I can not go a day with out them. They work great and smell clean and fresh. "	&&&
I received a free sample of Preparation H medicated wipes for women from Smiley360. My mission was to try these wipes and give feedback/review on how I liked them. I tried them and I love them because they are cool, soothing, and they smell terrific. Just the right smell, softness, and comfort I needed. I recommend this product to all women who are in need of this product.	&&&
Love these. Best so far - have tried several brands. There is another 7th Gen that isn't as soft so make sure you get the Original Soft Free & Clear.	&&&
They came in TWO BIG packages. I didn't have a refill container at this time, so I just lugged the big white bag around with the wipes. I have one child in diapers and this lasted me a whole month, and that included some of them were thrown out by a toddler. They didn't make my child cry like some wipes do. I can't wait for another sale to stock up on. Thank you!	&&&
Dried up before finished treating hands. Germ X wipes much better. Very cheap material. Disappointed in product. Would not recommend	&&&
Use at home and the office for quick cleanup and disinfection.	&&&
I love the smell of these wipes and they are so soft.	&&&
What can I say about these? They are what they are!!!	&&&
"It works good... doesnt dry out keep wipes nice and warm for my baby bottom !! I have nothing bad to say... strongly recommend this product if you don't want to spend a lot of money"	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes and they are a lot stronger than the regular sensitive!	&&&
Great wipes...good smell, good size and good texture.	&&&
These smell great and work amazing. My son was having some issues using regular wipes, these help him out so much. The added ingredients are so soothing. The other factor is that they help mask the diaper smells. They are so thick that they help clean up messes better too.	&&&
"I love these wipes! I love the sent and so does baby! I also love how soft, gentle and effective it is on baby's nose and face."	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. They take off every inch of makeup using only the cleansing side of the wipe then I use the exfoliating side, which us definitely a little rough if you scrub to hard but works amazing. I then follow up with my regular skin care regiment. I used to use the neutrogena wipes from target and they always made my eyes water and sting like crazy. These are definitely a million times better !	&&&
Love the new smell of these!!!	&&&
mild to baby's sensitive skin.	&&&
these makeup remover wipes are of a very good quality . Its non irritant and definitely one of the best wipes I have used so far . It has a cooling and refreshing effect without giving that dry feeling to the skin.Its perfect for removing the eye makeup , especially for those with sensitive skin. I like the product and its quality.	&&&
I switched to these from Pampers Sensitive because they don't contain alcohol and my baby was having a problem with persistent diaper rash. These wipes tare every time I try and pull one out of my wipes warmer dispenser! Argh!!! I never had this problem with Pampers. Sometimes, I literally only get a 2 inch by 2 inch square of wipe. I also think I end up making more passes over my baby's skin (not helping the diaper rash problem) because they don't seem to remove what's there very well. Guess I'm going back to Pampers.	&&&
I bought these on a whim on a trip to Sephora one day. I'm a fan of the gentle cleanser so I was hoping these would work out. After using them for the last 2 months they've given me that slight burning sensation as well, especially around my eyes. Also I'm not sure if they're supposed to be like this, but they're constantly at a soapy, bubbly texture that I don't really like. Once I wipe them on I get suds or bubbles on certain areas of my face and when I wipe my eyes it irritates them and makes it hard to see. I was wondering if we had to combine water too by using the wipes but it says to use them dry or with no water? Seems odd.. I would not purchase these again.	&&&
This is a great value on the baby wipes, I have bought them many times before, and like them.	&&&
Wonderful to refresh your CPAP mask.	&&&
These wipes work very well. They smell nice and leave my skin feeling clean and soft. A nice addition to my skin care regimen.	&&&
"These lens wipes really work well. I have grown very dependent on them.
Packaging is excellent. Recommended."	&&&
We got these originally on a cruise ship and found these wipes incredibly useful. They come as a hard tablet and then you just drop them into the water and they become a towel. Now we carry these everywhere and they are incredibly handy in our diaper bag!	&&&
These do a great job, and work as well as I expected, based on my high regard for clorox products. With a dusty house, a hairy dog and messes galore, it went above and beyond. My favorite part is the size, they really are large enough to do an entire room, a definite improvement over swiffer furniture dusters and wipes. Great for those of us with allergies. Only One thing to look out for: they do smudge a bit on some surfaces, and I would try them on a small and hidden area of any furniture first, just to be sure they don't harm your surfaces. Worked great for everything around here. Will definitely be buying in the future.	&&&
These wipes are the perfect size for purse and travel. Yes- they are the economy version - which means smaller and not quite as soft. However - they still do the job as intended for $10 less for about the same quantity of the original version. The smaller size also takes up less room in a purse, backpack or suitcase which is a big plus for me. I am very pleased with my purchase. Delivery was quick and timely.	&&&
Wipes are very easy to get out. The,box is heavey enough so it doesnt move around.	&&&
Of course works great. I aways use these wipes on the kitchen counters and they always do the trick. Much easier and quicker than using a paper towel and spray.	&&&
Easy to open little packets of soft, fast drying antibacterial wipes. Carry them all the time. Have reordered many, many times.	&&&
I've loved Bioderma for a while, but these wipes are fantastic! They are gentle, yet they do the job, a single wipe goes a long way. The scent is pleasant and delicate. I highly recommend them.	&&&
Love this product. Convenient when you need to disinfect in a hurry.	&&&
Our little one has sensitive skin and these wipes have proven to be gentle enough to clean her well without irritation! Would definitely reccomend these!	&&&
This product is great it disinfects and cleans really good.	&&&
They work great, once you polish your silver.	&&&
I only buy these types of wipes for my son! They are super soft and clean up very well!	&&&
Amazing wipes! very thick and strong and they pick up a lot! Also they don't dry out fast which is great!	&&&
These are the very best wipes we have ever used. We use them for everything with our baby. We use them to wipes her hands, face and little bottom. I've loved them from the first time we used them and I have never worried about them breaking her out in a rash. LOVE them!	&&&
Love this product for clean wipe downs around the house	&&&
god for itchy eys	&&&
When we got our delivery, the box was beaten up and open. When We opened up the boxes inside, the wipes had leaked and everything was wet.	&&&
"I purchased one box of Blefadex to try out , but i find it to be Totally dry! no wonder my Ophthalmologist only prescribes cliradex .
Amazon should stop promoting and selling this product."	&&&
The container is small enough and attractive enough to keep one in each bathroom. great for quick wipe-ups (caused by me or the dog!) Appreciate the disinfecting qualities without the disinfectant odor.	&&&
Bought these after receiving a sample at a local cloth diaper store. They are gentle, easy to use and smell so lovely. I have used them for about a year and no problems.	&&&
Great product! I like that it's all-natural and smells good without harsh chemicals.	&&&
I like the idea of the packaging, but as noted by other reviewers, the wipes don't "pop up" so you have to "dig" for one every time. But I love this company and the quality of the wipes.	&&&
These wipes are easy to use, they store well, and they do a good job. We mainly use them to clean off thermometers after use as well as clean cuts before dressing with bandages. Highly recommended.	&&&
great; portable; bigger than expected packs	&&&
4 stars for being unscented. But otherwise they are thick and get the job done. Lasts us a few of months with two kids in diapers.	&&&
Compared to other makeup remover wipes this one exceeded my expectations. I use it mainly to remove make up at night before I wash my face and it doesn't dry out my skin.	&&&
Great. The only thing I dislike about it is that the wipes are actually attached to one another, sometimes making several come out at a time.	&&&
These are the best to polish silver. You have to wear gloves or get black fingers, but disposable gloves are inexpensive and readily available. With these wipes you don't have to do a lot of rubbing but quite the opposite. A couple of rubs and its' shiny. I also have the treated fabric type that shines silver but they require a lot more rubbing. I don't use them anymore. I just use these. I cut these into quarter sizes. I find the smaller size is easier to handle when polishing silver jewelry. Be sure to wash the silver and your hands after using it.	&&&
I bought these because they are very gentle due to less ingredients than almost all other brands. However, because they are so difficult to separate each wipe it became too much of a hassle to use them with a squirming 1 year old. For this reason I will not purchase again.	&&&
They are always useful and provide great smells to the house.	&&&
Quick & easy, but too pricey."}},	&&&
Always use this products in my kitchen and bathrooms, particularly for sanitizing the counters and bathroom areas. I have used them to wipe doorknobs, toys and even small floor areas."}},	&&&
i tried these wipes not to long ago and i really like them the scent is not strong and these dont break my daughter out like most scented wipes do the only downfall is they are always sold out in my area and the store i use doesnt carry them online yet	&&&
Easy to use! Ensures that my kitchen is being disinfected and deodorized all at the same time!! Disa W.	&&&
safe to use around food, picks up stains, quick clean up.	&&&
These smell awesome and do a great job.	&&&
these are great and i use them all the time in my apartment! easy to use and gets the job done.	&&&
Love this product, a must use for your every day disinfecting needs!	&&&
Wonderful product like always. So soft and they smell great too!	&&&
Overall I love Pampers products and we love the wipes. You can beat the price for the subscribe and save, so it worth it.	&&&
My baby has such sensitive skin. This product works great for keeping her face fresh and clean without harsh chemicals.	&&&
I AM A NEW MOM AND I HAVE TO SAY WE RECEIVED A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AT OUR SHOWER AND THESE ARE MY FAVORITE!	&&&
These are great for easy clean up of messes around the house. Also for when you need to disinfect after kids have been sick.	&&&
these wipes are perfectly fine for using. i saw no problems with them	&&&
I tried the Pampers wipes, but they just don't separate easily enough. And when you're trying to keep a wiggling baby from spreading the poosplosion even further up their back (EW!) you really need wipes that are going to separate easily with one hand. Also, they are thick and textured which makes them easy to hold onto and good for big messes. They also don't irritate my baby girl's skin.	&&&
I like the wipes and the price. However, the so called "re-sealable" packaging does not really work. This leaves the wipes exposed to air and they dry up! The clear sticker that is supposed to reseal the wipes just rips and does not stay whole. I will only buy the resealable wipes with the plastic lid-not the sticker from now on. I like Costco brand wipes because they reseal with the plastic lid, not a flimsy sticker.	&&&
I can't live without these wipes! I've been using them for years with my son! It's a must have for any mom! They smell good too! The wipes are very soft and gentle."	&&&
Love this. Works exactly as described. Check out the dimensions though - it was bigger than I was expecting.	&&&
This is the only thing I can use to wipe my daughters nose (or, for removing debris after using the Nose Frida). One time we ran out and she fussed and would turn her head like crazy if I used a plain tissue (good luck moistening one - they just fall apart). At first I thought, what s silly product, no one needs this", but it is a must have for my infant. We buy in bulk!	&&&
I have been using this product for long time and I love the fact that the brand is better than the other .	&&&
the wipes are much thinner than the other line by seventh generation.	&&&
Terrible! When you try and get a wipe out, they all come at once, and when you try and seperate them, they rip into pieces. Trying to "clean up" is also impossible, as they tear, leaving your hands and such exposed. Would rather buy the cheap off brand I get from the store than these!	&&&
I love the smell and feel of the wipes. They don't leave any residue on the baby's bottom and are really durable and well made.	&&&
These are terrible. They made my son break out in the worst diaper rash I've seen, bleeding and bubbly. My sister in law used one on her baby and though the rash wasn't as bad she experienced the same reaction after just one wipe.	&&&
Awesome product, very simple and it works so that's what we need- I use it in between workouts or after workout when I can't shower or don't have time, for armpits, gooch area, neck, face, lower back- it gets you clean!	&&&
Received one from my shower as a gift and loved it so much. We purchased another for me to use at work for diaper changes. I can say when we got home from the hospital our little one screamed at diaper changes then I asked my husband to hook up this wipes warmer and diaper changes have been different ever since....no more tears!!! She hates to be cold!!!	&&&
I use these daily for countertops, cleaning bathroom,etc. sams club is best value for these wipes.	&&&
The only problem I have with these wipes is that they are thin. In comparison to buggies wipes quite honestly I am afraid I may get poop on my hands lol. Otherwise they did the job and it was a good deal for organic	&&&
We used the old ones and were very happy. I am tired of the package tearing and so on. Additionally based on other reviews we will not be purchasing this product anymore. Granted Costco does not make the wipes, but they do put their name on them. I buy Kirkland brand because I expect a quality product in the brand. The same formula that has made Costco successful. Someone really screwed this one up if you ask me. They were the best wipes on the market, not anymore.	&&&
The smell the Is great. The wipes are fantastic. It's easy to get the yucky noses cleaned!	&&&
we LOVE these best wipes around 100% better then any other expecially if you have sensitive skin and a sensitive child	&&&
they arrived fast and will last a long time!	&&&
We have these in all the bathrooms. Very convenient for us and our guests. Clean well and smells fresh!	&&&
"I do not use these for their intended purpose; rather I use them as handkerchiefs. I was looking to nix the paper facial tissues and opt for something reusable and long-lasting but also organic. These really fit the bill. I find that I don't need multiple tissues to feel 'satisfied' anymore - one of these wipes will do the trick. They don't seem to 'soak in' moisture as well, but they definitely make me feel clean and are undoubtedly soft on my nose.

I ordered three boxes of these for a total of 30, which is currently too many for me, but I felt it was good to stock up for allergy season/any upcoming colds/my future family. So no regrets there.

As for cleaning, I just rinse the wipe in the sink after using it and make sure it's generally clean. I hang it to dry and then put them in the wash with everything else. I also put these in the dryer, and they DID shrink about 1 - 2 cm. But that's no big deal to me... They are cotton after all, so it's a no brainer; if I cared, I wouldn't have put them in the dryer.

Overall, these are a GREAT buy if you are looking for handkerchiefs!"	&&&
The sensitive wipes are nice but they don't smell very good. Would like to see a better scent but overall we enjoy them!	&&&
This product is genius for us who can't get saline drops into our child's nose and it keep them from having soar upper lips or dry noses. Wonderful product!	&&&
Some of the best wipes by far! I love a good wipe that doesn't crumble at the 1st site of poop ? but honestly a great choice!	&&&
Use this product to clean lots of things in my home. Love all Clorox products!	&&&
My son has very sensitive skin and these wipes are great. They are very gentle and don't cause any irritation.	&&&
I bought these for a long haul flight. Previous comments spoke about usinig after the gym or swimming. These are no better tthan baby wipes. There is no real scent to speak of, and they are really just moist toilettes. For the price that is not sufficient. Ban makes some body wipes which are much better and at a fraction of the cost.	&&&
My only problem with these wipes is the smell I think these are a bit heavily scented	&&&
Great price compared to other wipes. They are gentle on my daughters skin and they seem to clean up better than other wipes I've used. The packaging is cute too! I will continue to purchase these.	&&&
I try to keep these on hand for sticky fingers and was happy to find this pleasant scant as well as the comparable price."}},	&&&
"Its moist, smells great and great for sensitive noses. It a must for those winter months when your little one has a runny nose. I just wish they had a bigger pack of 100+ wipes."	&&&
"i have a package of these in every room at my house and use them all the time."	&&&
I love the smell of these wipes. Perfect after baby poops. I just wish this scent came for the sensitive wipes	&&&
If you read what it says on the package which is shown in the pic I uploaded, that is the exact reason why I purchased this. I brought whole bunch of similar one from Korea and LOVE these single-ply cotton wipes. I even soak this in my toner and put it on my lips for dry-lip treatment. I decided to give this particular one a try and it is just perfect. I will order a bunch so they can last for a while. Thank you for the amazing product!!!!!	&&&
I only buy HUGGIES wipes!!! They are the absolutely the best!	&&&
Sorry - I guess I didn't pay attention. These are very small wipes - like maybe someone would put them in the bathroom. My adult son is incontinent and they do not work for cleaning him up. They are too small and they do not smell good. I am picky about smells so they may be okay to others. But they smell horrid once missed with bodily fluids.	&&&
These are one of the only Huggies wipes I will buy! I love them!	&&&
These have been incredibly convenient! I keep one in the kitchen and one in each bathroom and it's fantastic for quick daily cleaning. These wipes also make it easy for my son to clean up after himself when he misses.. O_O	&&&
Great product, real easy to use. Does a great job"}},	&&&
using these as makeup wipes, love them and they smell very good!	&&&
"Wipes are very easy to get out. The,box is heavey enough so it doesnt move around."	&&&
Best wipes! Thick and will clean up anything.	&&&
Hi, Great and work better than another popular brand !!!!! Trust me, you get more and pay less with these.	&&&
The fist time when I opened it, doesn't close completely. Easy to dry. I was very disappointed with this product.	&&&
I have used a lot of wipes in my days as a mother of 3 kids. I love the Pamper wipes they are soft and smell fresh while getting the job done without using a lot of the wipes.	&&&
"I seen these on Amazon and wanted to try them out based on the smell, yes I know that really is no real reason to buy baby wipes but I already really like Huggies brand wipes so thought it was defiantly worth giving them a chance.

Honestly, while I do really love how great these smell, the best thing about them is how thick and wonderful they work. I know they are selling them as one and done and that may be true *some* of the time but that isn't ever going to be true for all babies all of the time. I can say though that they are super strong and hold up better than any other wipe I have ever used and that says a lot because I am a mom of three with my oldest being 10 so I have used more than my share of baby wipes over the years.

In my opinion though they are worth the price and probably then some. I will for sure keep buying these!"	&&&
Sports mouthguards, orthodontic retainers, and clear/removable braces can get unsanitary, odorous, stained, and have disgusting gunk buildup over time. This is where Efferdent's Fresh Guard wipes comes in handy. When on the go, there are no faucets to rinse out mouthguards, etc.. Just tear open a pack of these wipes and clean it up. These work great in getting rid of saliva/bacteria odors, stains, debris, and calcium buildup. When at home, I can use the Fresh Guard soaks for a more thorough cleansing. Slight drawback: only 20 individual mouthguard wipes per box.	&&&
These wipes do a great job for most of your makeup. They do a great job with just about anything but eye makeup. I use something else for my mascara removal, but these are perfect for the rest of your face. My face feels clean and fresh after using these. I really recommend them for quick cleansing or cleaning off your makeup at the end of the day, but definitely recommend using something specifically targeted for eye makeup remover. I don't know that I'd call them exfoliating. There isn't a lot of scrubbiness to them. Sephora does have wipes that have a more abrasive side to them that are really great at exfoliating.	&&&
Great wipes! Would buy again.	&&&
These wipes have a pleasant, mild scent and they feel good on your skin or baby's. They are economical with natural ingredients, so I feel good using them. Just don't flush them when you're done - the wipe is made of a soft, yet sturdy fabric that needs to be disposed of properly. I plan to buy these again and I'm glad to recommend them to others.	&&&
Works as advertised. My husband and I enjoy this product	&&&
I do love this product. However, it has not been delivered as of this date	&&&
After using the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes for awhile, I noticed that my eyes became sensitive and would turn red/puffy after using them (weird!). I opted to try the Simple brand and I'm so glad I did! I have dry, acne-prone skin and the Simple wipes do not irritate my skin/eyes at all. They are very effective and work great for removing all my makeup without the need of a face wash. Will definitely repurchase.	&&&
Those negative reviews must be from Purell's rivals because these wipes are very moist and sturdy and they clean very well.	&&&
I use them all of the time. Just as great as clorox wipes.	&&&
"These washcloths are made of bamboo? Really? They are so soft, I thought someone had figured out a way to
turn clouds into washcloths!!! These cloths have been incredibly helpful. My 3yr old grandson is a boy and gets
messy as all 3 yr old boys do. I was going through an incredible amount of babywipes to clean him up each day.
These cloths have allowed me to cut down drastically on the amount of wipes I've been getting. The cloths are
easy to wash and have stood up very well to repeated washing. I was given a chance to buy the washcloths at
a great price to try them and give my honest review and I love them."	&&&
I've always trusted and used Clorox in liquid form but with the wipes the cleanness is right at my finger tips. Thanks Clorox	&&&
We started out with sensitive wipes when my daughter was born. These really helped out her little sensitive bottom. We eventually switched to the natural care as she got older. Really you can't go wrong with any Pamper wipes.	&&&
Works great!! I love the way it works. My house feels and looks clean.	&&&
They are very small, and the liquid evaporates very fast. They are affordable though and I've used them a lot and still have most left after a year or so. I'm a little mixed on them. I give them 4 stars, becuase they work great for phones, its my first of this kind of protect and they have never damaged anything! Plus so many wipes for a like 7 cents a piece!	&&&
We use them in a very busy optometry practice - would not rely on anything else, especially during flu and cold season!!!	&&&
These wipes do an excellent job.	&&&
This definitely worked as promised! It makes all my stainless steel appliances and tools look shiny, squeaky clean and new! I like the idea of the wipes better than the bottled solution because I am the clumsiest person in the world and I have a hard time approximating things. This is definitely a 5-star product!	&&&
"We use these to clean our kitchen countertop and they work very well. I would definitely recommend them."	&&&
Love these wipes. Work great and I can use one wipe for a lot of tasks.	&&&
These are great to wipe a snotty nose when you are on the go! Always have a pack in the diaper bag!	&&&
loved these wipes. other wipes gave my son rashes but these didnt.	&&&
This product is easy and good to use fast clean and fresh sent.	&&&
First I would like to say that I have VERY sensitive eyes, the texture of these was just too rough on me! I usually have issues with wipes and them burning my eyes due to the liquid in them that, who knows how, somehow gets into my eyes. I have only used these twice, but I have no choice but the return them. My friend did try a wipe and she was perfectly fine with it around her eyes. It did remove all my makeup, so I gave it 2 stars instead of one! Hope this helps a few people out.	&&&
They really work as advertised he he	&&&
These things smell fantastic	&&&
Still has a little baby powder smell but works fine.	&&&
These are great anytime. I travel for work and these are very handy.	&&&
Great Lens wipes	&&&
These wipes are the best! I use them on any and everything!	&&&
"I originally bought this thinking it was a wipe warmer but kept it anyway as it looked nice compared to the cheap dispenser boxes that come with the wipes.

It seems like good quality and it's super easy to operate with one hand. I like that the weight of it is enough to keep it from bouncing around when I pull out a wipe.

The reason I only rated it 3 stars is because it doesn't seem to dispense the wipes any better than the cheap boxes. At $20 I hoped it would be a drastic improvement."	&&&
Not great wipes! Dry out quickly, are slimy, and stink! I can't deal with how perfumy they are! I can't wait until we have used the last package!	&&&
They were for my wife Patti and she says they were great.	&&&
Use Clorox bleach daily on counter tops to disinfect and in laundry (towels) to control virus germs	&&&
These wipes are so much better than any generic brand. They are very thick and I end up using less wipes because it does a better job at making sure my baby's bottom is clean.	&&&
These are awesome. With all the germs floating around today you can never be too careful. I carry a pack in my diaper bag, my purse, luggage. Anywhere I can put them I do. I know I always have something to wipe my kids hands with no matter where I go. I received a discount in exchange for honest unbiased review.	&&&
It's a good product but my most recent order was fulfilled with three smaller 60-count boxes and 20 loose wipes in a clear plastic envelope. It was not the box of 200 pictured on the product page, which I had received with a previous order. I much preferred the large, 200-count dispenser box, which fits nicely in my closet. The smaller boxes are unwieldy and who knows where the 20 loose wipes have been. Disappointed.	&&&
We love these, soft and durable. Love that they are unscented too!	&&&
I love these wipes. They are soft, gentle and get the job down. I also like that these wipes are a bit thinner than the Pampers Sensitive. I feel like I can get in the crevices easier to get the job done!	&&&
These work sooo WELL when you are on the go and are unable to give a full bath; my pup loves them and gets excited whenever he sees the box; leaves a pleasant light Cherry Almond Scent, makes coat shiny on smooth hair dogs....WELL WORTH THE $$$	&&&
These are very substantial and are the perfect thing for after a workout at the gym when there's not time for a shower or when the workout has not been extremely intense. Some reviewers thought they were too small, but they are just right for me.	&&&
I always keep a container under every sink in the house. Convenient to grab when cleaning windowsills, baseboards, touching up floors and pet messes.	&&&
Great product to clean everything in the house with.	&&&
Excellent wipes. Not paper thin, just perfect!	&&&
Great with tough messes and disinfects all in one!	&&&
wish the label would indicated it as a refill	&&&
"Great for my baby's stuffy nose. Very handy"	&&&
Great for quick and easy scrubbing. I use them on all hard surfaces.	&&&
These lip wipes are fabulous! I was a little hesitant about the price, but man do these work! Just a blot and then a swipe and my lips are free of old color! Before, I would just put some makeup remover on a tissue, but that dried my lips out so much and made them peel and crack the next day. This is definitely a portable and easy to use staple that should belong in every beauty guru's bag.	&&&
Clorox wipes does not leave a film like the Member's Mark wipes does.	&&&
These are great for wiping down all kinds of surfaces. I use them in the kitchen, the bathroom and various other places to help keep germs at bay."}},	&&&
Great for when you gotta go on the go.	&&&
good wipes at a great price	&&&
Great convenient disinfectant. Nicer to use than a spray bottle. A lot less fumes as well. Love these!	&&&
I've been purchasing unscented wipes for the longest time. And it just so happen that I came across this wipes and tried it. I don't like the scent. But all in all, the wipes are strong, the wetness is just enough. It's just the scent that I don't like.	&&&
We've been using these wipes since our baby was born and they're the best. One time, we bought wipes with a fragrance and we were convinced, it gave our baby a rash. Go with sensitive wipes if you can for your baby!	&&&
The wipes are extra large which are nice but seem a little dry. A good deal for the price though.	&&&
I got these diapers for my French Bulldog who refuses to be totally housebroken. While this is a good product, he can easily take them off and we had to go to pants with suspenders.	&&&
I use these daily to clean most surfaces in my house. I go to bed stress free knowing my house is germ free!"	&&&
"it is good, fast.
i love pampers, and i used it for more than 2yrs.
it is good for the baby's skin."	&&&
Best price I can find in the market.	&&&
I keep a package of these at home and at work. It's perfect for a quick clean up of a mess or a quick disinfecting clean. I make sure to keep them around during cold/flu season especially. "	&&&
Cleans effectively but very gentle on baby skin! Strong on messes so you use less wipes	&&&
Of course it's not my mouth being cleaned so I can't give a first hand experience. My four month old smiles when I clean his gums and reaches for the wipe to try and stick back in his mouth. I think they have a faint lemon scent.	&&&
these are my favorite wipes for my son they smell great and he has no reactions to them	&&&
I tried Pampers wipes because of the pretty packaging and the fact that I like to change things around sometimes to open us up to more options. Pampers wipes are WAY too moist and slippery! My hand always slips when trying to use them and they leave a film on my hand. Plus I end up using several for poopy diapers. These Huggies (one and done) wipes are AMAZING!!!!! You will get less than most brands, but you use FAR LESS for a diaper change!!!! They're almost like a wash cloth! I would recommend these to anyone with a child in diapers or for someone caring for the elderly or disabled!!!	&&&
I received my free sample from Smiley360 and i wanted to share that I tried these Preparation H Medicated Wipes for Women and gave some samples to my friends. I tried it and I have to say I liked the cucumber scent and how the wipes were very cooling and soothing. Would highly recommend Preparation H Medicated Wipes for Women! Thank you!	&&&
Good for personal hygiene after using the bathroom. Removes what you want to remove, including odor. Leaves you feeling fresher. Flushes easily.	&&&
These wipes work great and are very soft and gentle. They don't take a ton of wipes to clean up the mess either!	&&&
"I am all about easy cleaning and these Lysol wipes are able to keep a canister in every room. I take one to work, and also keep one in my car. I have one in the kitchen and one in each bathroom. Lysol has the easiest dispenser too."	&&&
I love these because I can use them on her face too and she doesn't break out. I have seen people say that they would never use wipes on their baby's face. Those people must never go anywhere because when we are out and I need to wipe her off I don't see another option. She has sensitive skin and these never affect her.	&&&
Decent wipes for the purpose"}},	&&&
I have ordered these twice. The first time was fine, but the 2nd the wipes had a bad smell, like old damp socks.	&&&
I decided to start using Meguiar's products on my car in lieu of Armor All due to some long term concerns with Armor All; I've been very satisfied!	&&&
These wipes are a mothers best friend! We use these to clean and disinfect all our wonderful childrens dirty, sticky, slimmy handprints they leave on walls, cabinets, tables toys and anything else they can manage to reach!	&&&
this product is great I love it. it works anywhere in the kitchen room or bathroom. plus they smell great and deodorize.	&&&
Smells amazing and they a super thick and soft makes changing diapers nicer. The wipes I go for every time!	&&&
I've been buying Pampers Natural Care for years. These wipes by Amazon are thinner at first impression. After using most of the case, though they are thinner, they are durable and not prone to tearing. They are not as moist and the wipes in the top half of the package are much dryer than those in the bottom half.	&&&
These are my favorite face wipes! I love them. They remove everything really nicely, but leave your skin feeling moisturized and healthy, unlike many other makeup wipes.	&&&
Have'nt had the warmer for more than 4 months and has already quite working! Does'nt warm wipes very well either, only the ones on top closest to the heat source.	&&&
My kids love Kandoo Kangaroo, I love Kandoo quality! We love all Pampers products, but what's exceptional about Kandoo wipes is that they ARE flushable!! Have you ever tried to have the regular non-flushable wipes by the toilet? Guaranteed, at some point, someone forgets they're not flushable and...well, let's just say, it can be a disaster! Kandoo does it all! Kandoo cleans, freshens, and less wiping means less rashes, plus, they have a great scent as well...all in flushable fashion!	&&&
I typically use the Lysol wipes with bleach for every day wiping down clean up. I saw these and thought I'd try them I shouldn't have. I'm not particularly fond of the smell, but that's personal choice. I just don't feel like they do anything. The other wipes left a slightly wet area that dried quickly this doesn't do that at all. Maybe,I just got a bad bottle if that's possible but not willing to spend the money to try again. I'll just stick to what I know. They also don't come apart very easily. It's a much thicker material I think the normal wipes.	&&&
A must have for parents! Keeps wipes moist and the weighted piece inside holds the wipes down just perfect. I have always really likes Oxo products and this one doesn't disappoint!	&&&
These are my favorite wipes to use. Thick and no overpowering scent.	&&&
Love these for quick messes especially in the bathroom	&&&
Shined it right up! Did follow up with a dry cloth and it looks great! So much better than the spray which used to get all over the floor and make it slippery. Love these wipes!	&&&
Very gentle on my baby's skin. We haven't had any problems with diaper rash or irritation	&&&
fifth order of this. Best eyeglass wipes and use it for the computers. No streaks.	&&&
Awesome wipes at a great price and packaging works so you rarely pull out too many or get stuck digging around for one	&&&
I like disinfecting my hands or any parts of my body, and my personal things by using these Lysol wipes.	&&&
"I love these wipes
If i spill a drink in my cup holder of the car
I just use one of these and it cleans up perfectly
and i like that these comes with a scent
so i feel better about cleaning with this"	&&&
Great value	&&&
"We use these wipes all the time. My son has a tendency to always drop or throw his binky. These have come in handy. Not only to they nicely clean off any dirt they leave the binky smelling of candies:)"	&&&
I use these wipes on every surface in my house. I love these because its an easy way to clean up messes without having to spray the area down and grab paper towels. Its a great plus that they're disinfecting and kill the flu virus.	&&&
These are great wipes to use for baby's sensitive skin.	&&&
This was a life saver. My little one hates cold wipes. So having this in this size was a blessing. I can take it with me in the car because of the adapter and have it at home.	&&&
The wipes were very dry. Tried at least 5 pieces and then returned.	&&&
Never used one on my first daughter. My mom talked me into buying for new baby. Warms wipes but not very convenient. Always forget to plug it back in. Should've been battery operated. Makes wipes smell funny.	&&&
"These work great!! My 14 month old hates having his nose touched, but doesn't mind these at all. I've used both the great grape and unscented varieties. I keep them everywhere, in the car, diaper bag, at daycare, and on the night stand. I would give them 5 stars, but the package can dry out."	&&&
These wipes are baby skin friendly and are very strong. One wipe does the job!	&&&
Love the smell. So much better than the standard.	&&&
I do use all types of Clorox brands but by far this is my favorite. I use clorox wipes to wipe down everything in my kitchen and bathroom and love how after I am done cleaning my house smells like I just ate an orange.	&&&
Best baby wipe ever! I use it to remove my makeup, too. I love that it's thick, unlike other wipes. Sensitive enough to use when babies have mild diaper rash. Cleans like no other. It's my favorite baby wipe and I'm sticking with it.	&&&
Best wipes I have ever used compared to Huggies and Pampers. These are durable, soft and does not leave any residue behind. The sheets are big and thick, good for every kind of mess. Safe for babies' bottom, hands and face. I stuck to these wipes because they are THE best, my son will be 1 years old, no allergic reactions to them either.	&&&
Love, love, love these wipes. Fresh scent, prefect thickness, soft enough to clean any area.	&&&
so....many....wipes....so....little...spent!! My wallet and daughters butt thank you.	&&&
easy and work well. i am glad to use this product. highly recommend	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. The price was great!!!"}},	&&&
I like the large opening for this case. It's easy to grab one wipe at a time. Haven't had issues with wipes drying out. Holds enough for a day or two out.	&&&
Great wipes--you pull one wipe, you get one wipe, not 10! Soft and durable.	&&&
These things are wonderful for quick and thorough cleanups!! i love them!	&&&
These makeup remover wipes truly did the bare minimum of what they're supposed to do. They'd take off about 1/3 of my makeup before I just ended up scrubbing my face raw... don't buy this seriously	&&&
These are all I have and will continue to use on my daughters. Absolutly love them!	&&&
We've tried A LOT of wipes and this is our favorite hands down. It's the perfect thickness, softness and absorbance, and it smells fantastic!	&&&
Between the kids and the dogs there is always a mess. Clorox disinfecting wipes are great for quick and easy cleanup.	&&&
"These wipes are way too expensive for the what its worth. Also, they repel water. Yes, they eventually soak it up but that takes some time before they start soaking water.
To sum it all up:
- Absorbency issues, cannot be used as a cloth wipe unless presoaked. The most unabsorbant wash cloths ever made!
- Untextured and hence cleaning up using these is difficult.These wipes are not enough to wipe off goo unless they have been presoaked for some time.
- It takes atleast 2 wipes to do the job of one in case of messier diapers.
- Charlie Banana advertisement! Huge tags sewn in on each wipe which can be cut off if you prefer, but you may risk having sharp edges
- Its a stretchy fabric which makes me think if they are truly 100% cotton!"	&&&
Mirror and glass look really nice after this	&&&
The wipes worked as advertised. I had no problem with the dispenser and desks that were skipping no longer skipped after I cleaned them with these wipes.	&&&
These are excellent wipes. They truly are soft and thick.	&&&
My sister told me to use them and was she right. My daughter neverminds if I use them on her. I love the smell of them too.	&&&
great wipes	&&&
It is so convenient and light-weight. it looks small but it can really carry quite enough wipes for short trips like church and the like.	&&&
I am disappointed with these wipes! I bought these to try them out because they were cheaper than the others I usually buy at the time. These wipes do smell good, but they're way too wet!! They literally leave suds, like soap, when using. And for me, I bought them to use on my 1 year old. And everyone knows that leaving a baby's bottom wet when changing a diaper causes diaper rash. Also, these rip really easy.. Just pulling them out of the Huggies tub, they rip in half or even in small pieces. The wipes themselves aren't that big so dealing with half a wipe is nearly impossible. Also, when pulling them through the tub, it never catches the next one.. So I constantly have to open the tub and feed them through. I have to pull extremely slow and extremely gentle for it to MAYBE catch the next one. Overall this product is just bad. You live, you learn. I'll stick with Parents Choice. They're bigger, durable and cheaper! I would NOT recommend these.	&&&
I expected a more manly scent.	&&&
Everyone of my daughter's elementary school teachers uses wipes daily to clean the desk. It infuraites me that these dedicated professionals have to personal pockets to purchase supplies such as these for their classroom. So what I have started doing on Valentines' Day, Birthdays and for the holidays, I always include a triple pack of Lysol wipes to our gifts. The look of appreciation on their faces is always so rewarding. Classrooms are clean, teachers are happy and less germs for ALL!"}},	&&&
Got them for my boyfriend as a slight joke but he actually loves them!	&&&
I love this products because it disinfects everything properly including the bathroom i live in a house full of men and this does wonders on our bathroom	&&&
I'm a first year student in college and the wipes for down there have come in handy more times than I can count. The toilet paper at school is terrible, so if I have to go to the bathroom on campus, I like to have these on me at all times. Also, they actually feel more gentle than the summer's eve wipes, which feel really soapy to me.	&&&
These wipes barely took off my mascara, which is all I wear. It isn't even waterproof mascara it is just regular and they couldn't get it off. Not impressed.	&&&
I love these wipes for my daughter. They are the only ones i use for her and there not expensive. I would recommend for all soon to be mommies for there soon to be born baby!	&&&
We have tried different types of wipes and have found that these work the best for us and our budget. We also provide some wipes in shower gifts for our friends and tell them to try them out on us. They in turn love them and we swap savings tips back and forth. .	&&&
I' ve always used these cleaning wipes .. Great product	&&&
Easy to put on/take off. As long as you check to make sure it has covered the dog's penis, it is moisture-tight and, apparently, comfy. My dog never seemed to notice he pew as wearing it. I think this is obvious, but in case not, it only collects urine, not feces.	&&&
These really come in handy to clean up messes quickly, especially when you have children. With the amount of mess they can create, it's imperative to have a container of these wipes handy. I even keep a container in my car because you never know when you will need them. These wipes are a lot more sanitary as well since they are the use once disposable type instead of sponges or reusable wipes, plus they have bleach in them which helps to disinfect and kill a number of germs."	&&&
these are great for everyday cleaning, esp when you and your husband share one bathroom! boys can be gross. "	&&&
My son is 4 months old and I've used these wipes since he came home from the hospital and he's never had any reaction to them. Plus, they are very gentle but clean very well.	&&&
Good product for a very very very very reasonable price. I have these on subscription for me and my sis.	&&&
With a bit of a family history of sensitive skin - I've always sought out fragrance free options - and very happy with these. In addition to the lack of added fragrance - I've tested these on my own skin and have no reaction to them whatsoever. The only reason why I don't love them is that they are not 'flushable' or biodegradable. If they were, these would hit a sweet spot in my book.	&&&
I use these wipes just about everywhere around my house. the kitchen, bathroom table counters cabinets all types of appliance . it disinfects . especially when I have to little ones running around touching everything. it makes me feel alittle better that I know I can keep things clean a little simpler.	&&&
We started using these, and then switched to the Target brand for a time, causing our LO to breakout in a terrible rash. Once we switched back to the Babyganics fragrance free, the sensitivity went away. I like that they're wet enough without being too wet, and the towels are pretty sturdy.	&&&
Been using these wipes for over 3 years with both of my girls. Best wipes I have come across. Soft, gentle and absorbent	&&&
"this product is user-friendly easy to open very small and compact wipes they do not dry out and they're perfect for using in the diaper bag or in areas that the pacifier wouldn't need to be completely washed."	&&&
I bought these after seeing that my go to wipes (Earth's Best) had changed their formula yet again. These are smaller, less moist, and thinner than the Earth's Best wipes (at least the ones they used to make). These are more similar to the 7th Generation wipes in size, moisture content, and thickness. I'd say they are absolutely perfect for newborns, although I'm using them on a toddler. These work just as well as Earth's Best or 7th Generation wipes, and without all those extra chemicals! These wipes basically prove that the extra ingredients in other wipes are unnecessary. Some people have suggested using regular paper towels with water, but I have yet to find paper towels that are as durable as these wipes. I would think that regular paper towels would fall apart too easily when used on a baby's bottom. We have been using these for two months and have not noticed any issues with mold. These are my new favorite wipes. They are the best!	&&&
I got these as a free sample and they are amazing my baby is sensitive to most things but not to these. They are great!!!	&&&
I like these wipes a lot. They can be used in my Cottonelle dispensers and the larger plastic dispensers as well. There just the right size to do the job and they are strong. They are a bargain on Amazon as well.	&&&
My 7 month old has very sensitive skin and we got a free trial from seventh generation and we love them! He hasn't broke out in any rash :)	&&&
Have used these wipes for all my babies. Great for sensitive skin!	&&&
Great wipes.	&&&
great quality wipes!	&&&
Tends to leave streaks. Convenient but I find myself needing to go back after for the streaks	&&&
Love these wipes and the great price through subscribe and save! I buy 2 boxes a month with 5 kids and 2 in diapers. I like the soft scent as well, even though I usually go for unscented.	&&&
They smell good and they don't irritate my sons skin!	&&&
These wipes are very rough compared to other brands I have used. It's almost as if they create friction on with my baby's skin. They don't hold moisture well. I will not be buying these ever again.	&&&
love spring cleaning with these wipes! Makes cleaning so much easier!	&&&
Good product and strong sheets. I know they are refills, but wish they would come with at least one tub to keep the wipes in as some other ones comes with one plastic container. Those containers don't last forever and it would be nice to have an extra one around. Overall, I am happy with the price and the wipes worked very well.	&&&
Good for sensitive skin.	&&&
This is a great product. Well designed, woks perfectly, keeps wipes moist and looks good in public view.	&&&
"I use this everyday as my main disposable and reusable wipes container .it holds enough wipes to last me a day and it keeps them moist!!..i do love that its portable and you can plug it in the car!!!!!...as a mom on the go i need simple and effective yay to this product oh and the cord is nice n long :)"	&&&
Great for everything! Most helpful when I am cleaning the litter box for my cats ;) Good product!	&&&
I keep these in my bathroom for easy cleaning everyday! My family loves Clorox!	&&&
These are perfect for long road trips. Helps little booties go potty cleanly!	&&&
Am using these all over the house. Love em.	&&&
my son recently had a virus. these wipes kept the rest of my family from getting sick	&&&
keep a few of these by my chair and the sofa and on the kitchen counter. saves a lot of unnecessary steps. work very well, just big enough for the hands. I am very skin sensitive and these do not bother me.	&&&
Clorox wipes are my best friend with two kids running the house...affordable easy to clean grease spills and other stuff.	&&&
I bring Chlorox Wipes with me when I take my little ones out to eat at restaurants. High chairs and tables are often not sanitized property, I use Chlorox Wipes to disinfect the surface before sitting down to eat with my family.	&&&
great, cleans well makes all my surfaces feel bacteria free!	&&&
Great for cleaning, nightmare for your sewage. Spent $300 to clear out a main line clog on my 5 month old new home because of wipes. Will never use again.	&&&
"Our son had terrible diaper rash when we got home from the hospital. We were using Huggies Sensitive Natural wipes, but they were irritating him further. These were the only wipes that didn't cause more damage to his sensitive skin.

Would definitely recommend if your baby/child has extremely sensitive skin."	&&&
"These wipes lasted a long time, I think you should buy these everytime if you want wipes, saves you money in the long run."	&&&
Rough wipes. These need to be like towels, instead they feel like paper. The result is that when you open one it feels like grease paper against your hand and after 15s dries up and is like sand paper. Perhaps the wipes are intentionally designed as such and there is a hidden merit to it. But, I prefer softer towel-like wipes.	&&&
This product does not leave streak marks when wiping your laptop or any digital screen. Awesome!"}},	&&&
Low-price good wipes my pets no complaints	&&&
Used this to clean my newborn's bum as the wipes were irritating her sensitive skin.	&&&
I love the fact that they don't leave any residue like some other brands do. Also, they smell great.	&&&
i love this wipes case! This one helps dispense 1 wipe at a time, unlike normal wipes cases which is just a box And you have to pull the wipes apart... Really helpful when changing a poopy diaper!	&&&
"Feel way too thin, and do not come apart easily enough.

Pros
These were a bit cheaper than pampers

Cons
They feel much thinner than other wipes, including pampers which I normally buy.
Every wipe is too attached to the next (they do not pull apart easily), not a huge problem if you use a dispenser all the time, but it is a problem when I try to pull them straight out of the bag.

Overall
I did not like them , I much prefer other wipes, mainly pampers."	&&&
I love Clorox products because after I use them I feel like everything is clean and smells great	&&&
Great wipes easy to use and noticeable difference on your skin, little funky smell that goas away quick.	&&&
I thought these would be resealable packages but not so. These are the refills only. The wipes are ok otherwise.	&&&
Have use wipes since my son was born. No diaper rash. Very pleased.	&&&
I love them for the ease of use and for the job they are doing. Makes cleaning much more easier	&&&
I really loves these! I wish these came with a scent like the baby fresh smell wipes.	&&&
So gentle and great thickness! My favorite wipes. Most diaper changes I only need one! Even with some nasty #2 changes!	&&&
I order these wipes via Subscribe&Save but this newest batch tout a new formula that I can honestly say left me pleasantly surprised and impressed. I have tried many brands of personal wipes and these by far leave one feeling fresher and cleaner than any I have ever used.	&&&
I received this as a sample/share from Smiley360.com and I was so excited b/c I have wanted to try them for a long time! They are really great! They definitely work well and leave a cooling/comforting sensation that helps with the discomfort. I will be buying them again the future and am so glad that I was able to try them before buying! The fact they are flushable is also great b/c I hate having to put them in the trashcan, so that is definitely an added bonus!	&&&
Wanted a chemical free wipe for my parents to use when watching my daughter since cloth wipes were a little too much for them (we cloth diaper). These are great, do the job, but my mom said she "hated" them because they don't come out of the dispenser easily and often get stuck.	&&&
Works amazing especially with the hoover floor cleaning solution. I live in a place with clay dirt and lots of rain so my 5 kids and two X large dogs REALLY mess up my hard wood floors. This hoover leaves my floor clean. The only cons are that the vacuum suction is weak and the water tanks are a bit small so you have to fill them often.	&&&
We love these so much that we might keep buying them in the post-diaper era! My wife particularly likes the one & done variety because they seem to get stains out of upholstery!	&&&
I work as a bank teller in the downtown area of a fairly large city. Let me tell you, I have seen some surprisingly disgusting personal hygiene issues come though on a daily basis. And they all touch the same surfaces you do when you come to cash your paycheck! We use the wipes to clean counter tops as well as the surfaces of the electronic and regular pens. Believe me, you should feel much better after learning that fact. I'm pretty sure this simple act has stopped at least 2 outbreaks of the plague this year alone."	&&&
These wipes don't irritate my baby's bottom and they smell great and get the job done. They are strong and tough when wiping and they don't rip"	&&&
Made the mistake of trusting Huggies and bought the big box of these wipes! I hate them! They are hard to separate, rip easily, and usually end up causing me more of a mess than I started with. Hate"	&&&
I do gel nails, and they wipe off any access good enough. I havent had any issues with the item. Theyre a great bargain but beware of shipping they take a long time to come in. So if you use these alot make sure you get seceral packs so you can have enough time to reorder some more	&&&
Tried these, did not care for them. I usually use the natural care ones by huggies but found these for a good deal on amazon. I did not care for the smell and did not feel they worked as well. I ended up giving most of them away to a friend.	&&&
Love the idea of having Clorox in a wipe. So easy to use to disinfect computer keyboards and phones. Or to wipe down counters."	&&&
The wipes are very small and not very moist. I would not recommend them unless you are driven by a price.	&&&
The product gets high marks for packaging, looks appropriate in a man's bag and each wipe is individually wrapped for convenient use. However, the wipes fall short in my opinion. Dude wipes are thin, much thinner than the wipes I typically use at home and I always found myself using two wipes together to achieve a similar result. The scent was pleasant and not at all over powering. Great idea just a little short on execution.	&&&
Im a mommy now!!! foe the last 2 years i've used huggies soft skin wipes/ any kind of huggies wipes for my daily morning routine of washing my face. using huggies wipes of any kind on ur face either alone or [with a tiny bit of baby oil and baby lotion (as recommended by a friend) ] will cleanse and moisturize ur face and prevent acne and leave you feeling fresh and clean. i used to use the wipes solo on my way to work as i would drive, before ap plying my makeup (not the safest routine) [i recommend using the baby oil and lotion on the wipe as it wont dry out ur face before applying makeup. thanks huggies for contributing to my beautiful skin and my sons fresh bottom :D ~THE MODEL~	&&&
They keep baby nice and clean. And there's no chlorine. Probably the best baby wipes at this point in the history of the baby poop world. Hahahaha	&&&
I love these wipes. I actually used them to get the makeup off of my eyes as well as my face. The texture helps to make sure your face is really clean.	&&&
I think these wipes are much more durable than the other "sensitive" brands, and keep the moisture much longer than the Pampers wipes.	&&&
Great deal! Works awesome!	&&&
"I use these on my paintball mask. One wiping keeps it perfectly clear no matter how much I'm sweating, and it lasts for hours.

I should point out that it looks like most of the negative reviews are from people attempting to use it on glass. As long as it's plastic, you should be fine."	&&&
First off,I love Aveeno products in general. I use the foam face wash and the moisturizer. So why not try the wipes? I did and I like them, As the packaging says "ulta calming" they are just that. However they do seem a little dry but I wiped using the front of the wipe and the back and my make up came off without any problems. I decided to purchase the wipes because I use the face wash on a daily basis. They smell nice and the wipes are not overpowering. I like these very much,but I wish they were just a little bit more moist. 4 Stars for that reason :(	&&&
I love that you can just grab and go with the clorox wipes. They are handy to have in the car also. The scent makes it smell very good too!.	&&&
I like these wipes because they hold up well and smell good.	&&&
great product i use it all over my home also keep some i my car	&&&
Love these wipes. Work great for baby and as a make-up remover!! Perfect for the baby wip warmer!	&&&
my FAVORITE wipes =) my little one has never had a rash (knock on wood) they smell great and i feel like i use less of them making them last longer	&&&
LOVE the lemon one! It's not an overpowering scent, which is hard to come by for a sensitive sense of smell.	&&&
"Love these wipes! Non irritating, thick.. No poke through when wiping up a poopy butt ;)
These are the ONLY wipes I use on my baby!!!"	&&&
They fall apart! And are not as gentle on baby's skin as pampers wipes.	&&&
These reusable washcloth baby wipes are so incredibly soft. They are much softer than the cotton wash cloths that we usually use. They glide right over the skin, with no tugging or pulling. My kids used these in the tub and even though they are so very soft, they still got all dirt and grime right off. Because they are bamboo they are naturally anti-bacterial and anti-fungal, you don't want anything gross in your dirty laundry pile. Bamboo is also much more eco friendly than cotton or disposable wipes. Why add all those wipes to a landfill? I was thrilled to receive these during a special promotion pricing and this is my honest opinion.	&&&
i love how easy and convenient the wipes are! they give me a good piece of mind knowing the clean and disinfect.	&&&
Nice clean puppy..yay! Smells good too!	&&&
Love these for my 4 legged baby!!	&&&
The only wipes my son can use.	&&&
I was looking for a cloth type to clean my C-Pap mask. This product is like a piece of paper a little to stiff to get in the nooks and crannys."}},	&&&
I would recommend this product to anyone but especially to mothers with little children. They're convenient and easy to use to wipe down anything!	&&&
"It is a really good product and really helps getting any dry boogers off your children's noses. We know how annoying that can be."	&&&
Fast delivery and good price. Exactly as advertised.	&&&
I use these for nursing & before I pump for my baby. I love these wipes! They are very handy. It's a nice thing to have to clean up before & after feedings or pumping. I love that it is also safe for the baby to nurse right after cleaning your breast with one of these wipes.	&&&
"These wipes work well, like the scent also. Easy to use."	&&&
I like that theses wipes are always very wet and even suds a little with use. Gentle on my baby's skin.	&&&
"This is a good value for the money.

The ""kit"" contained two 8 oz. bottles of the Purell gel, 2 packages of the 1 oz. bottles, both with a ""jelly"" holder and 2 containers of the Purell hand wipes.

Thus far, I have no complaints. My wife is very pleased with the assortment and is taking some of it to her work and in her purse. So long as she's happy, I'm happy!

PROS: Value for the money, reputation of Purell (Gojo Industries)
CONS: Not really a negative but I would have liked the kit to contain individually wrapped hand wipes so that one could put it in a backpack or purse, instead of the container."	&&&
The wipes can stick together, therefore. You get 2 or 3 together instead of 1...otherwise, love the nice clean smell	&&&
Love the wipes. I use them everyday in my bathroom.	&&&
The price was great and the product as well. I am glad it comes with the extra tub to put refills in it. Sometimes the tubs brake, and is just nice to have an extra tub around the house to keep wipes in different rooms.	&&&

I had three kids in two yrs two of them being identical twins . With my first born I used everything brand name I love HUGGIES wipes becuz there thick but they tend to rip apart easy !!! I now use parents choice walmart for diapers wipes etc , if ur a first time mommy you don't have to go all out for baby products ... They are a bit more but other brands do just aswell	&&&
Truly fragrance free and clean just as good as Clorox wipes without the harsh chemicals. Love these products!	&&&
Great product. These organic reusable wash cloths are so soft and gentle. They are brilliant to use on the sensitive skin of your little ones. No need to spend out on disposable wipes now so this product is so economical and better for the environment. They wash up well and maintain their softness. I highly recommend these great cloths, not only for babies' use but also for adults too especially those with sensitive skin.	&&&
I have used these wipes for past few years and Sams club has best value for me plus free shipping. They usually arrive in a few days. I love the combo pack with the 3 travel packs which I use for vacation and the diaper bag.	&&&
Wipes are moldy!! when i noticed they are moldy, i already used 1/3 of it. opened another one, seeing black moldy spots on the new can. not sure why they are moldy.. but won't purchase ever again. will use other baby safe surface wipes from now on.	&&&
With 2 kids under 3 years of age, we go through a lot of wipes, and these wipes are great. We especially love the case and the travel case that comes with the box. Both are very useful.	&&&
I've been ordering these for most of my 17 month old's life. They are the least expensive, effective Eco-friendly wipes I am aware of. Yes, they are small and thin, but they do the job.	&&&
I love the regular Scrubbing Bubbles bathroom cleaner so when they came out with Scrubbing Bubbles Antibacterial Bathroom Wipes I had to give them a try. I am glad I did. They are so quick and convenient. These work great at keeping the bathroom tidy and maintained between regular cleanings. I have a little one who doesn't always hit the toilet properly and I have to clean up dribbles on the toilet and floor. These work wonderfully for that. They are so easy to use he can even grab one and do it himself. I really don't buy a lot of convenience products because they tend to be expensive and I'm on a budget. I do buy these periodically because they last a while and they make my life so much easier. It's worth it to me.	&&&
Young wife who loves these wipes. Soft and clean feeling wipes. Feels wonderful on my face and skin. Happy wife- happy life.	&&&
This is my GO TO product for everything! I clean counter tops, bathroom, floors, tables, tvs, ect with this product! It cleans and disinfects together. They also come in different scents. I go through a three pack in a week and my family has gotten significantly less sick than we ever have before! I would recommend this product to anyone and i do!	&&&
I use them for glasses, my sunglasses, my crystal earrings, and my cell phone screen. The rest of my family uses them as well. They are indespensable, and I will re-purchase when we run out.	&&&
I love Clorox Disinfecting Wipes especially in the work place. I keep them up near my desk so I can disinfect every few days. They are perfect way to keep things clean and germ free. I use them at home to in the bathroom. "	&&&
I literally have these Clorox wipes EVERYWHERE. In the kitchen, in the bathroom, in my car...you get the picture. :) lol They are so continent. Perfect for little messes, especially if you have little ones! One little wipe will disinfect the area. They also come in different scents. I personally like the lemon scent. :)	&&&
As a ftm I certainly have discovered what is worth money and what isn't. These wipes stand up to the messiest of diapers but sensitive for my babes skin! Durable and they don't dry out! "	&&&
"More value than buying individually . Had more in each container.
Last longer for cleanup.smell overwhelming. Need better scents.

Good value. Buy again"	&&&
"these are great for after gym use.
they smell great and make you feel clean.
well worth it will def be buying again."	&&&
So delighted to find these as they are perfect for the traveler like me. I use this product at home in the box, but on the road or in the air, this is the perfect complement.	&&&
I had previously purchased a stainless steel spray for my appliances but was not happy the results. These wipes produce a streak free shine to my appliances."}},	&&&
Love these wipes, they are med thickness with a cloth consistency. Very soft and easily take makeup. And absolutely affordable. Love, love, love!	&&&
These wipes are the best in town. Soft scent, easy to use and good for travel! My 4 month old has very sensitive skin and these are the only ones that don't cause her to break out in a rash. "	&&&
Anyone who owns an English Bulldog knows the wrinkles can cause a lot of bad odor. They collect dirt in those creases. One wipe a day and the dirt and odor are gone!	&&&
"Fits, works and performs as you would expect from a power supply, model was hard to find and very expensive thru local vendors, so this was a life saver on both price and shipping time.

Bundles with some really good electronic cleaning wipes that come wrapped individually, I will look for more of those once I finish this ones."	&&&
I thought it will work, but just a fancy box - does not get rid of the streaks... Save your money	&&&
I have had a subscribe and save subscription for this item since my 18 month old was very small. These do not tear and can handle the big jobs! I tried Huggies in a pinch and was very disappointed. I won't do that again! They never irritated his skin, but then again he just may not be sensitive to such things. Please pick these over pampers!	&&&
Cleaning the toilet is NEVER a task I relish. What I especially disliked was having to launder the sponges or rags I used to clean it, or having to waste a lot of paper towels. It got to be very expensive. I have always loved the smell and power of scrubbing bubbles. When I saw that they came in a convenient wipe, I jumped at the chance to clean my toilet with something that was flushable! It is amazing. Cleaned all the grime and stains instantly. Even the hard water ring went away. Plus the smell is great. Even after I had cleaned the bowl it had a nice clean smell after every flush. With this convenience I was able to keep up with the cleaning !	&&&
Wonderful product. So many uses around the house. Great for quick clean up item. Works in so many rooms for all sorts of cleaning.	&&&
I live huggie wipes they are thicker then any other brand and it seems as if I can wipe more with one wipe then any other brand"	&&&
These are my favorite wipes I buy the 504 pack from Walmart every time we run out. They work great and are a great price. I've tried a few others even ones from Huggies and these ones seem to work the best.	&&&
Great for all kinds of uses if you are traveling, or if you just like to throw these in your purse. There is no cleaner feeling than when you use these wipes. What can I say? They're the best!	&&&
These Clorox Bleach wipes are awesome, being a mother of 3 these are very helpful to do a quick wipe down to anything my kids get ready to touch. They are great to freshen up the bathroom in between clean ups "	&&&
These are great for cleaning toilets because they are disposable.	&&&
These wipes seem to work well (I didn't scientifically test them, so I trust they sanitized our hands as promised). However, I think I like this company's spray sanitizer better. I took these on our trip to Disney World, and with there being only 10 wipes per pack, I went through the packs pretty quickly. Then I would forget to put a new pack in my purse, so there were some days where we were without hand sanitizer. If I had bought the spray, it would have been in my purse all the time, and I wouldn't have had to worry about running out. So, these would be good for infrequent use, but if you need something handy all the time, I'd go with the sanitizing spray.	&&&
LOVE these wipes. Have tried other but always go back to these and will never switch again. Well worth the money to keep your child's hinny happy	&&&
They're great! My favorite of the pampers wipes.	&&&
Thick wipes, smell started to make me nauseous.	&&&
This get the job done without having to search for a cloth to clean your glasses	&&&
LOVE! These whips, easy to use and quick and convenient to use.	&&&
They clean great! They get any cleaning job done quickly!	&&&
The are actually the only wipes I use on my daughter and plan on using on my upcoming soon who is due in July. They are strong and smell great. They soothe and keep my baby girl squeaky clean without the irritation or roughness. I live by them	&&&
We use this in our diaper bag with cloth wipes. It has been great!	&&&
I use Clorox disinfecting wipes at home, at work, and when I take my children out to public places. I really love their cleaning power and the refreshing scent they leave after I've used them. They are a staple product in my home.	&&&
These wipes and so helpful! Clean dirty hands, wipe down dirty shopping carts, put in backpacks for school!	&&&
I love these single hand wipes and take them in my purse and use them pretty much every day. Great for small children to make sure they wash their hands often, and perfect for use during and after plane rides, subway trips, etc.	&&&
Had knee surgery and used these for a week or so. They work great in lieu of a shower.	&&&
I love Clorox wipe and bathroom cleaner. It disinfects and smell wonderful.	&&&
"These wipes are so much better than regular baby wipes! They are non alcoholic and the fragrance
is not over powering. They wipes are wet enough to clean hands, rails, armrests and steering wheels
but they do not leave any residue. The wipes are anti biotic and being able to wipe down shopping
carts, door handles and other places where germs may linger makes me more comfortable. I keep a
pack in the car where they are ready for small spills and quick clean ups. I am glad to have gotten to
try the wipes at such a great price and give my honest review. I really do like having them handy."	&&&
i love the soft, natural clean of these wipes. It is hard to find other places. Happy that your company has it.	&&&
Great PRODUCT-easy to use-good smell and good low cost! Will use from now on	&&&
"Resilient, simple, convenient and they work but they are too small for my needs.

These wipes do collect the dust. Other wipes I’ve tried just push the cat hair and dust around.

Having 3 cats that think that me and my computer desk and room exist solely for their mewing pleasure, dusting is mandatory.

For me, these wipes need to be 2 or 3 times larger. When I dust, I don’t want any part of my hand touching what I’m dusting. My hand doesn’t collect all that much dust and I want to clean as much area as possible with every swipe. Why should I swipe more than I have to swipe?

For example, when Swiffer came out with the X-large dry sweeping refills, they sold like hot cakes and initially had trouble keeping them in stock.

Most folks don’t care for puny cleaning wipes unless they are cleaning puny stuff.

THE CLAIM: One 7” x 8.5” wipe will clean an entire room.

Really? That’s a pretty bold statement. In my tests, this might be true for a 12-foot by 12-foot room with a desk, computer table, bookcase and file cabinet all with smooth surfaces ... and it does a good job.

One might come up lacking trying to clean a 484-square-foot room filled with furniture and decor.

If you swipe one against a section of rustic oak or cedar, it will have to be peeled off.

I suspect that these new synthetic micro fibers are made from recycled plastic jugs and bottles like fleece and coated with a weak adhesive. They have a weak tacky feel to them like a post-it note that can barely hang onto the refrigerator door. If I squeeze a wipe between my thumb for forefinger and then spread, the wipe will stick to my thumb and remain.

Wishing these wipes were bigger, I tried stretching one. They only stretch in one direction. The 8.5” length stretched all the way out to 17 inches and did not rip and retained its shape. The other dimension remained at 6-inches. These strong fibers did not break. They merely expanded the intricate weave and actually collected more dust.

There is a very faint waxy odor that is only detectable to me if I stick the wipe up my nose which I don’t recommend unless you have a lot of dust in your nose.

If I rub a wipe firmly between my thumb and forefinger, there seems to be a small hint of tacky residue on my fingers but it quickly goes away. For that reason, I will not use it on my computer screens or TV.

The directions say not to wet or use any kind of cleaning liquid. I wanted to find out why not.

Because these wipes are totally non-absorbent and will smear the moisture around like wax paper, that’s why. There’s already enough stuff smeared around as it is. I just want to make it go away.

These wipes will not remove the stubborn air-pollution film that builds up over time on smooth surfaces.

For such cleaning, I’ll “stick” with a soft, absorbent, lint-free cloth and Murphy’s Oil Soap in a spray bottle.

That’s my story and I’m sticking to it."	&&&
I use these washcloths for homemade baby wipes for my daughter. She has eczema and just overall sensitive skin. I've had no issues with her breaking out, etc. Just wish I knew the exact material these are made of.	&&&
These are great wipes. Most wipes have a sickly sweet/flowery scent, so I usually use the Preparation H wipes. They are witch hazel based, which can cause irritation and aren't really appropriate for hands or face. Dude wipes have a slight scent, but nothing offensive or overwhelming. Typically I use them "down there," but when I used them to wipe my hands and refresh my face after a long drive I liked the light scent and refreshing feeling. Great product.	&&&
Nice and moist. I don't like wipes that are too dry so I appreciated this one.	&&&
These work wonders on my dogs! I have a couple of smaller dogs who aren't especially easy to bathe. Just a couple of swipes over them with one or two of these wipes significantly eliminates odors and prolongs their need for a bath. The scent is not too strong. We and they don't seem to mind it in any way. I would recommend this product to anyone.	&&&
"This is a great product and is very gentle on sensitive baby skin"	&&&
These wipes are thick, fragrance free and a great value for the price where as you pay double the price for Huggies, Pampers, etc.	&&&
Have tried Ole Henriksen Grease Relief and Philosophy Purity wipes and definitely prefer this over. It doesn't irritate my skin and does not leave an oily residue like the others. There is a mild stickiness but not bothersome. Makeup wipes aren't supposed to replace face washing so I don't expect that squeaky clean feeling. Also, it removes my waterproof Marc Jacobs eyeliner and mascara but does require some work. However, it doesn't burn my sensitive eyes so it's not a bad give. I'm content.	&&&
It doesn't work as well as the Weisman spray. It leaves streaks. I was disappointed.	&&&
"Photo shows the old item which has a different size, texture and count. The description is correct. What you see is NOT what you get!"	&&&
Sells good and very soft but it is not as tough as huggies natural wipes and it is slightly smaller. Not bad for the price.	&&&
I love these face wipes. Perfect for getting make up off or if you get dirt on your face. They smell pretty good too.	&&&
I was so surprised how fast they came. They seem to be wonderful soft wipes. Just as described. I think they are great. Thanks!	&&&
Easy to use and smells great use them on my countertops	&&&
love these wipes, you can wipe without fear of being too rough	&&&
These are my favors wipes for my little one! I've tried all different types but I always find my self back at pampers! Plus they come out of the container super easy :)	&&&
Did not seem to work well for me. The wipes dry out quickly. The red thing fell off. Not using it at all.	&&&
You always need this around your house. No need to spray the counters, just wipe the surface with these wipes and you're good to go. Works great and is very useful.	&&&
Great product! Works wonderfully on my baby's skin. I do wish there was a slightly bigger size for toddlers.	&&&
"This product is awesome! The individual wipes are easy to access. It makes cleaning tough jobs easy for our company. The container is easy to store as it doesn't take up much space. We use these in our office, our shop as well as our bathroom. I will definetely purchase these again in the future. I highly recommend them for any home, office or work area. They remove stubborn stains as well as ink on furniture and equipment. Being in the landscaping business our employees get dirty easily."	&&&
"The boogies wipes is the best for the nose of my baby and my two others kids I love it."	&&&
didnt realize they were unscented, so thats my fault. but these arent very good wipes either.	&&&
Great wipes, I order them every month for my daughter	&&&
These wipes are great. They smell lemony fresh, and make it very convenient to clean. The quantity in the containers means they will last awhile. Great bang for the buck here.	&&&
like the one and done they work well, but the sent isn't like it used to be, not as strong and fresh	&&&
"""These are great for colds!

My sons nose was getting so raw and red. I bought these and now no more problems!"""	&&&
These work well for cleaning my puppies paws. He seems to like them.	&&&
"I used the One and Done unscented over 6 years with 4 babies and continued on using them regularly for next 8 years or so. That is a lot of wipes. I am not understanding who made the decision to continue selling them only in cucumber scent?? I could have kept using them forever for hand wipes, sanitary purposes, light clean ups but the cucumber scent is extremely annoying and not a natural scent."	&&&
With a family I keep this in my bathroom at all times so I can wipe down my bathroom everyday. Love it!	&&&
my husband use this brand all the time! He have used up many cans already!	&&&
Is it possible to be in love with a baby wipe? YES. I bought these wipes in the fresh scent (my daughter can REALLY stink her diaper up and needs something with a little added freshness to smell decent again), and the scent is actually very nice (think cucumber melon). Most baby wipes that are scented smell like that generic "baby"scent, but not these. They are also nice and thick, so they get the job done quickly, a must for trying to wipe a squirmy 16 month old (and occasionally her three year old sister when we run out of flushable wipes)...	&&&
"These wipes work well for daily use, but I've also found they do a pretty darn good job of scouring out the older, more ingrained dry ink that can set in on older, used white boards.

You definitely don't need them for routine, daily use, if you have an eraser. But, they, of course, are excellent for that (though obviously a waste if you have an eraser and your white board is still responding well to that eraser) - especially at the end of a work day, when you're all done with the board for the day and just want to make sure it stays clean and the more stubborn dry ink doesn't get a chance to set in."	&&&
Love these! They are extremely convenient and extremely effective.	&&&
Cleaning with a Clorox Disinfecting Wipe is always my preferred method to clean with. They very easy and convenient to use and most of the time I feel they have gotten the area very clean.	&&&
Product works amazing, especially on the messes my children make.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. I use them in every room of my home.	&&&
These plus a spray bottle convinced us to go back to cloth wipes. We had tried them but got a musty smell in our wipes warmer, so we gave up and went with disposables...until a friend gave us these and a spray bottle. We've been cloth wiping ever since! Great product.	&&&
I didn't want to waste money buying the soft wipe refills all the time so I decided to try this out. I put wipes in the pouches and I didn't use them for over a month, they stay in the diaper bag in a cool closet and I used then today and they are still moist! I was shocked and happy that they are this good. I'm really happy I bought this instead of the packages if wipes or else we would be throwing money away. I am not sure how it will perform during the summer months, if the heat will take moisture away, but we shall see. I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase.	&&&
Pricey wipes for average quality of wipes. dry out quick and don't last.	&&&
"I have been using these for a while now to keep with me when I am traveling with my children in particular. I clean shopping cart handles, booster and high chair seats in restaurants, just anything I am worried about having germs. I figure if it is good enough quality to work on a plane, I can feel safe to use it daily for extra protection around town.

[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]"	&&&
I love pampers diapers but I do not like sensitive wipes. They clean well and they are very soft but I do not like the scent that they have and when I try to grab one I usually get many wipes in one pull.	&&&
The description says eye make up removed but it's more of a makeup remover. It's hard to use on the eyes cause it's exfoliating wipes. They aren't as moist as I would like them to be. It takes about 2 wipes and I still have to use an eye make up remover oil to finish the job, I do like that the seal doesn't loosen when you open it.	&&&
We use Pampers Sensitive because my daughter seems to be allergic to all other brands of wipes. I'm glad Pampers is what she is able to use. The wipes are sturdy and never break apart. They also glide smoothly when wiping.	&&&
Works great on me lil ones nose/	&&&
best wipes we used so far	&&&
I bought this waterwipes few weeks ago and I found that the waterwipes were dried (supposed to be wet).	&&&
These wipes are thinner than I was expecting. I was expecting the same thickness as Huggies brand. They are noticeably thinner so if you are not careful they rip and tear. The smell is nice and does a good job overpowering other less pleasant smells.	&&&
Worked great to prevent eye stye	&&&
"I wear makeup almost daily, even though I'm at home. It's just the feeling of looking good for myself. I need a good makeup remover for the evenings and when I need touch up throughout the day.

The specific beauty eye makeup remover wipes should be called makeup remover wipes. It has the exfoliating side and a smooth side not as saturated as some but just enough to get the job done before washing my face. As far as removing eye makeup I still need an oil based eye makeup remover. I can use the wipes instead of a pad.

Overall I enjoy using these while applying my makeup and for taking off my makeup. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. Regardless the opinions found herein are based on my experiences with the product."	&&&
Product exactly as I expected.	&&&
I absolutely love these. I don't have to try hard to remove makeup it just comes right off and my skin smells so good afterwards, it's extremely smooth and never oily and never has a weird film afterwards.	&&&
good product good price	&&&
"We love boogie wipes! When runny nose season comes around, this is the only product we use. It doesn't matter if you have to wipe your child's nose 100 times a day, boogie wipes will keep their sensitive nose from becoming red, raw and sore. The grape scent makes them even better, because it doesn't remind toddlers of a regular tissue (escpecially helpful for those that hate having their noses wiped) so the grape scent makes things much more pleasant."	&&&
These wipes are basically in all of my rooms at my house they are very handy and very efficient I love these wipes!	&&&
use daily on high traffic areas..door knobs etc. convenient and smells great	&&&
Met expectations.	&&&
The wipes are nice and strong. They don't tear easily or dry out too quickly.	&&&
They dry out faster than some similar wipes I've used, but these are less expensive and I can't find the others anymore...	&&&
I really like these wipes they are more cloth like than others they don't tear easily. They didn't cause a rash either.	&&&
Nice wipes. They are hard to get out and i wish they were biodegradable but they seem safer than other brands. I'm trying a few other less expensive options to compare. Will update this review later.	&&&
Love them. Imhave grand children and these whipes work great.	&&&
"I bought these because Amazon was temporarily out of my usual Huggies wipes in the Subscribe & Save. I will not make that mistake again!

The Pampers wipes are simply WAY TOO THIN and weak. (They feel and hold up like the very cheap wipes that come in the plastic cylinders.) They tear just by pulling them out the wipe warmer! Try changing a dirty diaper and with the only free hand pulling a baby wipe from the wipe warmer...and it RIPS! Ugggg!

I will stick with the Huggies wipes, which I've used for each of my children. The Huggies wipes still as good as they were 18 years ago."	&&&
Wipes plays a role of mate to my daughter. She enjoys in wiping from it. No rashes No drynesss all superb	&&&
It fits about 10 pampers sensitive wipes, you could probably squeeze a few more but I'm afraid it will pop open. My baby has sensitive skin so I have to rinse the wipes before she can use them so this is way better than zip lock bags. In the long run the case will pay for itself since wipes refills are cheaper than travel wipes	&&&
These little wipes are the most effective means of getting rid of tarnish that I have found, and they do it instantly.	&&&
These are the only wipes I use!!!!	&&&
These wipes do the job. We go through so many of these that I am not picky about the wipes we use, I just always look for the best price.	&&&
I use these wipes for both my home and in a laboratory setting. We rotate three different disinfectants through our lab setting to control microbial and fungal contamination, performing a weekly cleaning with one cleaner per week. The disinfectants we use are these Seventh Gen Disinfecting Wipes, 70% ethanol solution, and 10% bleach solution (again, NOT using these at the same time). I personally have a lot of issues with the fumes from ethanol and bleach, so much so that I do not help clean when we use them in the lab, and in my home I do not hang around when the husband wants to use disinfectants with bleach or bleach alternative in them (although it is fabulous for certain things), and ethanol is not a common household disinfectant, especially at the 70% effective concentration. I am a fan of the smell of these wipes (they smell fresh and clean to me, not chemical-like), my kids and most of my coworkers also like the smell of them, but they do smell strongly and not everyone will appreciate the smell. As with anything, there are people that will find they have sensitivities to certain products, so if you find or already know that you have sensitive skin, wear some gloves- I doubt you will find a similarly effective DISINFECTANT that doesn't also bother you. If you are cleaning a food surface, it won't hurt to rinse with water (like with any other disinfectant), but in my opinion it isn't as necessary with this product as with some of the others. Obviously don't ingest the wipes or liquid (or really go ahead if you would like to go for the Darwin award). If you are worried about the product having an SDS (formerly known as MSDS), relax- everything has an SDS- most people just aren't aware of it (because who knew water also has an SDS?!). The wipes have a lot of "juice" so they give a great kill time on surfaces and one wipe goes a long way. The bottom line is that this is a very effective natural disinfectant that I prefer for my home over some of the harsher chemical disinfectants, so if you want a DISINFECTANT and not just a topical clean (if you don't understand that, google the difference between cleaner, disinfectant, and sanitizer to determine your end goal, and then do your research on what products you will need to alternate to achieve your desired result, as no product will kill everything), this is a great choice!	&&&
Love these wipes! I love the easy stay close lid. The wipes stay moist and don't dry out like other brands. Small packaging is convenient for throwing in your purse when you just want to carry a purse and leave the diaper bag at home.	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.I make most of my wipes so I was excited to get samples from seventh generation to try their wipes. unfortunately I was disappointed, they were thick which was good but they felt soapy to me and even though they claim to be "free and clear" I was not convinced that they were. After using them I left like I had to let my little one crawl around to air dry, because the wipe left his bottom really wet. I am bummed because I like their other products!	&&&
Great product! Keeps the wipes wet and the weighted plate is nice to pull individual wipes instead of a bunch at a time.	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my ownI love hear wipes. They are a great size and no scent which is nice since my twins have sensitive skin. Will definitely buy these wipes again and am thinking of getting it through epantry	&&&
My toddler has extremely sensitive fair skin and several food intolerances. His poor skin has been through so much with eczema as a baby from a gluten sensitivity and then a few months ago he started with a rash around his mouth that wouldn't go away. We tried hydrocortisone cream, antibiotic ointment, and aquaphor. It was being irritated by something and we couldn't figure it out. We discovered it was the baby wipes. I always use a wet washcloth on his face, but the daycare was using regular wipes. I asked them to start using sensitive wipes but he was still breaking out. Then we asked the daycare to just use wet paper towels and his face cleared up. We bought these wipes to use to get rid of crusty boogers and food and they have worked wonderfully without irritation or rash. They are 'wetter' than regular baby wipes and I have to use less to clean his diaper area and face. They are expensive but worth every penny.	&&&
These are really great. My husband brought these home and I was skeptical at first. They work so well and you don't get messy in the process. The only thing to note, and it says something to the effect on the package, is that you can't rub jewelry for too long or the metal could wear off. That being said, as long as you're gentle, these can be a time and life saver. I've already purchased several boxes and plan on being a life long customer.	&&&
This warmer is great. It arrived quickly and with a few bamboo cotton blend cloth wipes to try out, as well as one of the anti microbial moist pads for underneath the wipes. We use 24 baby wash cloths with 2 Baby Bum Drops dissolved in almost 2 cups of hot water and poured over the rolled up cloths. They fit perfectly and stay moist and very warm. The design of the warmer looks great and we like the logo on the front of the warmer..a heart with a lion inside and a crown on top. It lights up when the warmer is plugged in.	&&&
i love using clorox products it smells good and it cleans well	&&&
Soft and no scent!!!!! My favorite (too bad the diapers are not as great).	&&&
These wipes are excellent; nothing nasty added and useful for everything. They're great on my baby's skin although not super soft. We use them in combination with wipes from The Honest Company and no rash or irritation. Great value for money too!	&&&
They keep baby nice and clean. And there's no chlorine. Probably the best baby wipes at this point in the history of the baby poop world. Hahahaha	&&&
I mean yes these were convient, but for the price. Not so much. I'm going to buy baby wipes.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great because they clean, disinfect, and have a great smell. The wipes are the cleaning triple threat.	&&&
I have been using the Babyganics hand sanitizing wipes for many years and used to love the 75 count canister which I have not seen in a long time so had to purchase the smaller travel packs. I liked the original texture of the wipes better then these newer smoother wipes but I will continue to use these b/c they are not hard on my skin and also I can tolerate this brand b/c of my hyper sensitive skin.	&&&
I use these almost daily, and they are great during cold and flu season	&&&
"Never used one on my first daughter. My mom talked me into buying for new baby. Warms wipes but not very convenient. Always forget to plug it back in. Should've been battery operated. Makes wipes smell funny."	&&&
I like these wipes because they're thick and get the job done. they don't smell either so that's cool.	&&&
Good for cleaning CPAP masks and, in particular, wiping off the facial oils which cause air leakage from the mask.	&&&
THE NATURAL WIPES ARE SO AWESOME. I LOVE THE Sweetness of the wipes.	&&&
Best way to store homemade wipes!	&&&
I love that these are all natural because I can use them to wipe my babies face and hands as well. He's always sucking on his hands so I try to clean them constantly. I'm disappointed that the wipe itself seems to be thinner and less wet than the pampers sensitive wipes. I decided I like the fact that they are all natural enough to live with it but I would prefer they have a similar make-up as the others if I had that option.	&&&
These are probably my least favorite wipes. They are extremely thin and flimsy and do not get the job done.	&&&
My cat has been wearing a cone for a few months now and desperately needed something to assist with grooming. My cat hates getting wet so I wasn't sure how well these would work. However, these wipes are just damp enough to do the trick. AND my dog loves to get wiped down with these as well!	&&&
I always search for hypoallergenic products because my son was born very very fair skinned (almost porcelain doll equivalent ito his skin tone) & was born a ginger/strawberry blond & because of these traits his pediatrician said that he will always have super sensitive skin. In fact he gets red blotches on his body from the most minor of things sometimes, such as a touch so a hypoallergenic wipe such Baby Fresh is good choice of wipes for others like him. He tends to get red in his nether regions quite easily & I have to watch what's in the wipes I'm using because I don't want to turn this minor issue into a legitimate problem. Pampers Baby Fresh wipes kept him free of turning any kind of red down there & the thickness & softness were just right. Each wipe cleaned up at least twice of what much cheaper wipes clean up. If ever there was a baby/toddler who could magically create minor skin irritations/blemishes/red spots out of nowhere it would definitely be him so if a certain product works ito it not causing redness/temporary red spots then I feel totally comfortable saying that it should work for other children with skin sensitivity issues. I liked Baby Fresh almost as much as Pampers Natural or Sensitive (both my fave types of Pampers wipes) and I would recommend all 3 types of Pampers wipes to anyone who has a child like mine.	&&&
these wipes are pretty good. it gets the job done	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for quickly disinfecting areas around the house! Especially when there are little ones in the home!!	&&&
We love using these wipes for more than just bathroom needs. I especially love that they are enenvironmentally friendly and with such a large package, I don't have to buy them as often.	&&&
Love these wipes. They disinfect and stay moist for some time. The only drawback is that they can leave streaks.	&&&
I got the Dude Wipes at a discounted price for my honest review and i gave them to my husband to try and he loves them!!! He said that he feels much cleaner and fresher then ever before also he said that they do not break thru like some other brands that he has tried before.	&&&
Love this scent the best of any baby wipe on the market. Delicious. Cleans well, soft but tough, great price. You cannot go wrong!	&&&
Struggled to get my 1 yr olds teeth clean. We keep up the brushing to create the habit, but it is the Spiffers that actually get her teeth clean. I even have a few in my purse in case I need a quick freshen up.	&&&
Great price for the product! Did not pass this one up! Excellent to buy in quantities for the new school year. Will buy again.	&&&
These have literally saved my life in college. I use them on everything! Especially living with other people it's nice to know your stuff is clean and these wipes definitely get the job done. Again you can use them on everything so it's a really good decision to just stock up on these before leaving to school. "	&&&
These are a bit pricy, but I use these all the time onto little one. Now that she's putting her hands in her mouth all the time I keep these packs on her changing table. Wish they came in bigger packs though.	&&&
I have been using these since my daughter was born (almost 2 years). We love them and I think they are thicker and softer than the normal ones.	&&&
Very good product for on the go. I clean my baby hands, necks and leg when we spend outside. She keeps her hands and toe fingers in mouth and this helps us a lot keeping them clean all time.	&&&
These are a great replacement for those women who love to use baby wipes to clean almost everything! I really love the lemon scent the most. Just refreshing. "	&&&
Preemie baby, never had any issues with irritation. Great price, and it's nice to have these in bulk so we don't run in to issues with not having them on hand.	&&&
These are the only thing I will use. After my son broke out from every other wipes, these work perfect for his sensitive skin. Highly recommend	&&&
I use these wipes because they are gentle for my daughter	&&&
I like pampers wipes over huggies to me they smell so much more fresh and clean	&&&
These are great! I have been looking for the perfect portable wet wipes for use at work and these fit the bill. They're small, very quiet when opened and the packaging is pretty discreet. The wet wipe itself is unscented and as someone with very sensitive skin and sensitive nether regions in general, I have had no problems nor have I experienced any adverse reactions with these. The wipe is big and thick enough for two swipes (use one end, and fold it over twice to the clean bit). I'm so happy I found these and will continue to purchase them. Some pluses, if you care about this sort of stuff, is that they are cruelty free, eco-friendly (biodegradable and produced with solar energy), and made in America. All in all, definitely the perfect way to stay fresh and clean at work!	&&&
excellent product! very convenient to use and always cleans up the mess	&&&
With little ones, it is nice to have a quick clean up option that disinfects as well.	&&&
"As somebody with allergies, I try to keep a dust-free house. While that's virtually impossible, frequent dusting is a must. I normally use swiffer combined with a hand-held unit that makes things far easier to quickly and effectively dust a room. The issue with the ""dust wipes"" is that you have to use your hand and essentially ""touch"" everything you want to dust.

On their own, they do technically work better than swiffer when it comes to collecting dust. One swipe is all I needed and no more sign of dust. Everything from furniture to electronics, it does quite well. Although the surface isn't quite smooth enough that I'd trust it on the screens of your gadgets. Try it at your own risk! I also tried ""cleaning"" some surfaces, such as dirty keyboard. That didn't work well at all. Stick to dusting. :)

Overall, it works well on it's own, for it's intended purpose. I like being able to grab one when some quick dusting is needed. For example, my shiny Xbox One needed dusting. I'm done in a second. No need to go grab the swiffer. But when I need to dust the whole room/house, there are more efficient ways to go."	&&&
I am a wipes freak I have a 6month old bby I use on his toys, all over his room. Kitchen bathroom I love them.	&&&
"I usually buy the three-pack as I like to keep one in each of the bathrooms and under the kitchen sink, so wherever I am I know the Lysol wipes are not far."	&&&
I have a small white board on my fridge. These towlettes are easy and work better than a white board eraser...Better than using baby wipes or a sponge or a cloth. White board markers will stain.	&&&
Best mak-up remover wipes. Love how it has minimal scent :D	&&&
Very disappointed with these wipes. I was hoping Seventh Generation wipes would not be made of polyester. My hopes were dashed. Still looking for biodegradable wipes . . .	&&&
The lid is not air tight so if you go a few days between using wipes the wipe at the top drys out.	&&&
We love boogie wipes! When runny nose season comes around, this is the only product we use. It doesn't matter if you have to wipe your child's nose 100 times a day, boogie wipes will keep their sensitive nose from becoming red, raw and sore. The grape scent makes them even better, because it doesn't remind toddlers of a regular tissue (escpecially helpful for those that hate having their noses wiped) so the grape scent makes things much more pleasant.	&&&
love this product! Easy cleaning, gets the job done	&&&
Well pleased with the quality of the wipes. Love the baby fresh scent.	&&&
The best make up remover I ever used. It does leave your skin soft and nurtured. I don't need to put moisture cream at all if I use these wipes.	&&&
I use both Pampers Diapers and Wipes and never had any rashes with either of my kids. I love Pampers!	&&&
The Clorox wipes are very great and easy to use. They smell great also	&&&
So handy! Love using these for toys, pacifiers, and other random uses like to quickly clean off her nose aspirator between sucks! Awesome wipes to make life for a new mom a little easier!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes, they are so convenient and they always smell so nice and fresh!	&&&
Being a new mother I'm a bit obsessed with keeping the germs at bay... these have my life so much easier! I carry them in the diaper bag, car. they're ALWAYS with us!	&&&
Except for the individually-wrapped aspect, not any different than the baby wipes you can buy in-store. 44 square inches sounded bigger than it turned out to be. The two I tried ripped too.	&&&
I live pampers sensitive skin wipes. They are the most gentle wipes.	&&&
Used these wipes after walking through a construction area in the downtown area and they worked well with removing not only my makeup, but the grit that blew on my face. Left my skin soft and clean without any irritation. Definitely works for me!	&&&
Love these wipes. They are definitely for sensitive skin. I decide to try these when she was a newborn and have kept using because I had a feeling that' she would have her dad's sensitive skin. You don't have to use a lot of wipes.	&&&
use to use I dont have to get towels and find spray just pull out a wipe so easy	&&&
Comes with container that doesn't always pull the next wipe up. Also, there are pre-measured sections of wipes to fit in container but are measured too big and container does not close.	&&&
These are great.They smell nice. I also use them as cart wipes.	&&&
"I use these for wiping things down all day, every day.
I'm a stay at home mom with two small kids and I feel good about using these in place of other brands. My kids touch everything and are constantly putting stuff in their mouths. We avoid harsh chemicals and actually make some of our own cleaning products, but I always have these on hand for quick clean ups. They work great.
Only complaint I have: the scent. I love the wipes, but hate the smell.
Come out with a new scent Seventh Gen!!"	&&&
Love these wipes. No strong perfume smell, thick, soft.	&&&
easy to use. cleans and disinfects well. portable. clean. simple.	&&&
great bargain for the product. would buy again	&&&
"This product is genius for us who can't get saline drops into our child's nose and it keep them from having soar upper lips or dry noses. Wonderful product!"	&&&
These wipes are linty and tear easily.	&&&
These wipes are great so moist and get the job done every time lol!!	&&&
Can't go wrong with Pampers wipes. They're just so much more efficient and sturdy. I just don't care for the scented ones.	&&&
"Individual wrapped Wet Ones are great for travel; I made the mistake of getting 8 boxes for the whole house. Since we recycle, compost, incinerate and don't even use trash pickup, a plastic sleeve for every wipe is not good. A recyclable container and lid (it is a #1; smells like a candle when burned) are much better. The product doesn't say for your face but I occasionally use it on my face or body because it is all I have.

Please note: benzethonium chloride (the active ingredient in Wet Ones (kills 99.99% of germs)) does not kill norovirus. Neither will an alcohol based hand sanitizer kill norovirus on dirty hands. You need to use Wet Ones to get your hands thoroughly clean first, then an alcohol based hand wash like Clorox bleach-free hand sanitizer. To effectively kill norovirus you must completely soak both hands, thoroughly rub them together including fingertips and between fingers, and do that until your hands are dry. Two minutes with actual soap and running water will also work, but hand sanitizers and Wet Ones are for when you can't wash with soap and water."	&&&
I LOVE THIS PRODUCE. USED IT ALL THE TIME FOR MY DAUGHTER.	&&&
These were recommended when I got new glasses recently...they work very well and are easy to carry with you. Highly recommended!!	&&&
I LOVE LOVE this product. I have had issues since giving birth years ago with hemorrhoids and nothing seems to help. I used ointments and all it does is leave a mess. I love this as I can carry it with me when I leave home. Overnight trips, vacation this product works for me. Try it, you will love it.	&&&
"I was born in England and spent the first 35 years of my life there. I was using Simple products in the UK for 15 years before they showed up in the United States and honestly, this is one of those brands I'm proud to say came from my home country.

Simple is as Simple does. This product is not known for its scent or its fancy cleansing innovations. It is known quite simply for its pure, unadulterated, gentle cleansing ability without anything added. It does not irritate, it does not cause dry or itchy skin and is superb for even the most sensitive of skin types. I have used it around my eyes to remove make-up - even ""going-out"" make-up which we all know is applied with a pallet knife!

The Simple range of products are out of this world but the cleansing wipes are so versatile, portable and hard to beat in terms of value for money, quality of product and kindness to our skin which lets face it, is the largest organ on our body."	&&&
I was specifically looking for something that was good for sensitive skin and would not leave a residue or sticky feeling on my skin after use. These did just that! I keep them in my gym bag for a quick face wash before applying make up.	&&&
"These wipes are super convenient to carry with you because they are individually wrapped.
They helped to reduce the burning and itching caused by hemorrhoids.
The nice thing about using the wipes as opposed to an ointment is you
don't have to have finger to skin contact in application when
you use the wipes.
They have a pleasant smell too.
I got to try this product out free through Smiley 360 and I am so glad that I got
to try them out. I am going to be using Preparation H Wipes for women going forward
because they worked fast and provided soothing relief."	&&&
Almost immediately, we don't have any sign of diaper rash. I have a whole box of Costco wipes that I'm going to donate to Baby's daycare, because every time I have used anything else, she gets a red bum. Although in all fairness, I haven't even tried the Costco brand yet. Mostly just the store brands like Pampers and Huggies. Anyway, these smell wonderful. I use them as hand wipes before I eat at a restaurant. I use them as counter wipes if there is a mess. I use them as baby wipes, and she no longer needs butt paste. I love these Clearly Herbal wipes.	&&&
Didn't realize that these were refills, but other than that it's been a great value using subscribe and save.	&&&
These are great .We are stocking up for our upcoming arrival. My son uses them all the time and he loves them.	&&&
ok nobody like to go to public bathrooms so I take this with me and I clean the toilets wich I don't seat anyways but if for any chance I touch it I know or a feel is clean "	&&&
I love using these around the kitchen and bathroom counters. Im always paranoid when i cooking raw meat that i might have accidentally touched the counter before getting a chance to wash my hands. So these always come in handy once im done cooking.	&&&
"The little dog wraps (size ex small) were a perfect for my 10 week Yorkie! They were easy to use and reliable.
Would recommend to friends."	&&&
No issues with the transaction and the product seems to be working great and I would recommend this product in the future.	&&&
Even though I typically try to buy the "healthy" cleaning supplies because I have little ones and would like to keep my home chemical free, there is nothing like this scent to know 100% everything is germ free and THAT makes me feel better."	&&&
I use clorox wipes for EVERYTHING. Not only does it smell fresh and keep things from getting sticky, IT KILLS GERMS. No reason not to use these.	&&&
Love that I can wipe stuff down and not have to worry about it. Works great in the kitchen and bathroom areas. Pleasant smell and decent prices.	&&&
Just because these are hard to find in stores does NOT mean that they are ineffective! These face wipes are the best thing to ever happen to my face. They have witch hazel as a toner, so it helps control the oil on my face. My makeup stays on longer throughout the day just because of these cleansing wipes! They don't burn your eyes and they smell cucumber-y fresh. You will LOVE them!	&&&
I paid less for this three pack than I would have paid in a store. I love the Clorox wipes the best. definitely would purchase again.	&&&
I'm surprised at how well this doesn't leave streaks. I do highly recommend this if you are looking for something similar.	&&&
The box clearly indicates that one is not to flush more than one wipe at a time. Clearly not a product that meets its stated purpose, and shipping applies if one wants to return it.	&&&
These wipes thoroughly disinfect my bedroom in a snap. I use the lemon and orange scented Clorox wipes. They work great in taking care of the dust I want to wipe off like a snap. I disinfect my baby's toys and play pen using these wipes too. The wipes aroma make my whole room smell refreshing....it is not overwhelming and strong to give me a headache....which is also great. "	&&&
At first when you use this product it seems like its not working. But what it does is kind of work like a filler and it evens out the finish on the stainless to smooth and spotless. Love for elevators and dont have SS in my kitchen but I love this product and will use on my next house when I do.	&&&
I had previously only ever used Pampers and purchased these because they were a good deal and you can never have too many wipes, right? They work fine for their intended purpose but I have a few qualms. First, unlike the Pampers refills that come in packages that will easily go into your current wipes tub, this one box contains just two VERY large packages of wipes. Only about 1/4th of the package will fit in my wipes container and since there the package is not resealable, the rest end up in a zip lock bag. Second, I don't know if it's because they're thinner than the Pampers refills or what but I find them tricky to get out of the container since they don't like to separate easily. I think for ease of use I'd go back to the Pampers in the future.	&&&
These wipes are ample in size, soft and gentle, but they leave lint. Loose the lint and these wipes will be very good.	&&&
"This product does not leave streak marks when wiping your laptop or any digital screen. Awesome!"	&&&
"Why I Hate Clorox and Love Lysol
My normal disinfecting wipe was always Clorox wipes. I loved them and almost always had some around. Then they changed the formula from nice mild smell and wipe to "" Great on Kitchen Grease"" and now it smells and feels like EasyOff, it stinks and stays on your skin.
I could not understand why they would change something that people loved for so many years ( at least keep the old formula too ) so I gave Lysol a chance and I'm happy with it.

Why I love These
I use these for so many things. Nothing could be more convenient, I keep some in my car, and at work too.
They are great to clean: Phones, Cars, Desks, Chairs, Tables, Handles, Light Switches etc

They remain moist down to the last cloth provided you don't leave it open, They will freeze if you leave it in your car when it gets very cold, but will thaw out so no worries.

These are the best item to have at your home car or office. I always keep these stocked to wipe down any and everything I love the scent it gives it that extra feeling of clean with the citrus scent."	&&&
i love them!!! I have 5 kids and i use them all the time. they make it very easy to clean with a fast paced life.	&&&
I knew I loved the wipes the minute my daughter was sick with severe diarrhea (I know, TMI) and had the worst diaper rash I have seen in 2 years of her life! With huggies natural wipes she would scream in agonizing pain at the first touch, with these Amazon sensitive wiped she never even moved! They are thick and very soft! Would recommend these wipes to any one!!	&&&
I love these wipes! I keep them in my car and everyone says my car smells so good.	&&&
I love this product. Cleans so well and easy to use.	&&&
"There are a couple good characteristics about these wipes. The packaging: I do like how they're packaged like baby-wipes and not in a cylinder. Seemed to make better use of space and they were easier to pull out. The size of these are nice; although not ""huge"", but they are slightly larger than competition. Finally, I really like the dual texture of the wipe: one side is smooth and one is textured/rough/gritty; good for scrubbing.

But here's what I don't like and it's a deal breaker for me: They streak; they're too wet and not enough alcohol or other drying agent and they always leave a residue or streaking behind on kitchen counters, refrigerator doors, etc. You always need to follow up with a paper towel to ensure it doesn't streak. I tried wringing them out thinking they may have just been ""too wet"" but that's not the case.

So while I do like many things about them, I just don't like the way they dry."	&&&
This wipes are a great tool when it comes to removing your make up. They clean and at the same time exfoliate your skin. They have no scent but they don't smell bad either. Great product	&&&
These are awesome wipes. They feel so soft. We've been using these for about 2 weeks now. I've even used them myself. I figured I'd try them before using them on our baby girl. They leave your skin feeling soft and clean. I was worried how these would do on sensitive skin. I am so glad that we switched to these from the store brand we were using. Even though the store brand had shae butter they did not feel as soft. They cleaned the skin pretty well but they tore very easily. For about $1.50 more pampers wipes are better feeling and better made.	&&&
I was pleasantly surprised how much longer a pack lasts vs. the singularly sold cloths I use and they also clean just as effectively. A bonus is these cloths are thinner allowing me to use them on more delicate items. Highly recommend!	&&&
Always use Clorox wipes to clean up my messes! Love these wipes.	&&&
A fantastic product. I love the fact that I can use these wash cloths to clean up my little one rather than waste yet more baby wipes (or a dirty dish cloth!!) - more cost effective from both an environmental and financial perspective. They are impressively soft and are easily washed in the washing machine. It would be good to see more choice of colour but otherwise a brilliant idea.	&&&
I use Clorox a Wipes everyday.... Especially with a new puppy in the house. These are my go to items when we hVe a little accident. I trust Clorox with my puppy too!	&&&
It keeps my kids safe from the germs they carry in from school and easy to use. No more mess.	&&&
I think Pampers Wipes could use improvement. They are too thin and I have to use many more than I do Huggies.	&&&
Nice to have plenty on hand. Wipes come in several packages so no worries about unused going dry.	&&&
I use this all the time! It wipes away just about anything except wine spill stains on my counter...which I erase w/ the Magic Eraser (that you can buy on Amazon).	&&&
Bought these for my fiancé. He loves them! Will definitely buy again.	&&&
Best wipes around and not too wet. Price was by far the best I have found and I have tried many different types of wipes.	&&&
The wipes seem a little dry for me, package was sealed well though.	&&&
These baby fresh wipes have a very nice subtle scent and clean my baby's bottom very well.	&&&
Good old fashioned Handi Wipes are difficult to find now	&&&
I absolutely love pamper sensitive wipes. The only product I will use on my baby!	&&&
"I use this product on my son Brent!
He's a newborn and even though he can't speak I am very sure that he loves it.
Before he would cry every time i changed his diaper because when I wiped him the wipes were ice cold!

I feel that it is a great product.
I like the light it has also because I can find it easy at night and the room is not pitch black."	&&&
These are the BEST makeup wipes ever.	&&&
When this item was delivered, it had a black dot inside the section where the wipes go. It almost looks like it was glue that seeped through when the lining was glued down. I had to return it for another one. Not sure about quality control. Otherwise, I like the item. Just wished I didn't have to return and wait for another. That is a hassle. This was going to be a shower gift.	&&&
These wipes remain most, even if you leave the box open. Great quality. If you purchase these, you use much less than the bargain brand.	&&&
They grab the dirt and food residue perfectly! Better than Lysol wipes. These wipes are like Huggie wipes and Lysol is like Pampers wipes, as a comparison.	&&&
I ordered another box and it seems like this box I just received is a lower quality. The wipes are so thin I have to use a few of them. I compared them to ones that I had before and there is a HUGE difference. They are the same brand "Natural Clean". I had to switch diapers from Pampers to Huggies; it looks like I will do the same with the wipes. Very disappointed in the quality.	&&&
Best moisturizer for my skin. Makes it glow after I put it down and perhaps the only wipes that can effectively remove leftover wax.	&&&
"Ordering and shipping was excellent.
But Earths best has changed the wipes! I use to order the yellow box version of Tender Care- these are not the same! Smaller, less moist, and need to use many more wipes and elbow grease to clean poop. His daycare even complained about them. Faithful customer for 2 years, now switching brands :("	&&&
"I enjoy these wipes. They feel more natural than other store-bought wipes. They do not have a fragrance either. Great on faces too!
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
Not impressed with Pampers wipe for the price. I find the wipes to be thinner then other brands and therefore I end up using more. I will use this wipes for travel or in the car or to clean up after meals in the kitchen. They are also one of the more expensive brands of wipes on the market and you do not get as high a count of wipes for the price.	&&&
My wife needed makeup remover wipes for when we travel. Our days are busy and event filled and at night time, she gets so tired she falls asleep with her makeup on and then complains about her skin in the morning. These are perfect for her. She commented how deep down clean and refreshed they made her skin feel. It's good that they are oil-free too since she has oily skin already.	&&&
"I like these wipes very clean and easy to use. a bit pricy if you are looking for inexpensive methods.
the old household towel and soap works just as well. these are just very convienent to have on hand.
the containers are nice and could be washed and reused for craft items??"	&&&
Didn't last 1 week. package easily broke apart after 1 week right before I started using it and all the wipes dry out... sticking with my faceshop wipes instead.	&&&
Love these, perfect for the home, travel or anytime to clean up dirty hands, spills and babies, of course!	&&&
Great smell. Nice thick towelettes.	&&&
i am so happy with these wipes! pampers sensatives and huggies eat through my baby boy's skin and make him blead. Costco wipes are great, but these are a better value and are comparable. I actually find they are softer, yet just as durable. I am very happy i discovered these wipes and will continue to purchase them	&&&
I love these wipes! They are quick and easy to use & with 2 four year olds, they also prevent germs from spreading.	&&&
great, easy to use, use them all the time everywhere	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes. I use them when I clean my kitchen.	&&&
These seem to have gotten "thinner" and don't do the job as they used to. Am looking for a "studier" wipe.	&&&
"Quick & easy, but too pricey."	&&&
Not only are these wipes thick and clean up well but they also are good for freshening up between breast feedings when you've been up all night with baby	&&&
This makes the perfect wipe to keep on hand at the office. It cleans and polishes at the same time. Is someone important coming to the office? Cleaning service doesn't come til the end of the week? Just pull these out and your desk will look great! (Just need to process that pile of papers first!)"}},	&&&
Great product	&&&
Ordered these after a surgery I had a month ago. Had complications afterward & used them for wound care & bathing purposes. There're strong and soft. Would buy again. I also intend on using the left overs I have for traveling/camping. They are light and disposable, which means, one less thing to launder while camping or traveling. I have already used them in zip lock bags/old diaper wipe containers mixed with witch hazel and water for cleaning hands; like wet wipes. It doesn't specify, so I wouldn't use them as such, but it would be great if they were septic safe. Either way, I love them and would/will order when I need them again. Also like to add that these are NOT pre-moistened.	&&&
I love these wipes! They are so soft on my baby's bottom and they keep him from screaming every time I wipe his bottom when he gets diaper rash. I highly recommend.	&&&
"This was a life saver. My little one hates cold wipes. So having this in this size was a blessing. I can take it with me in the car because of the adapter and have it at home."	&&&
I enjoy these for general cleaning and for a better sense of sanitation, but to truly sanitize with these wipes is unrealistic. Cheaper to buy papertowels and spray and would be just as effective.	&&&
These wipes are great! They are so convenient to use that now there is no excuse to NOT clean!	&&&
Great wipes work just as good as the jug of refill"}},	&&&
I love clorox wipes for use all around the house. Especially the toilet!	&&&
Bought these for international travel. As previously described, they are extremely useful in case you want to avoid using the toilet paper etc in public bathrooms while travelling. The box comes with a number of small packets which can be easily carried around in a purse for people on the go. Would definitely buy these again!	&&&
"These are great because you don't have to rinse your face after you use them !
These are my favorite facial cloths!"	&&&
When our family uses Pampers baby wipes I know I'm getting a quality product from a trusted company. I love the security I have in knowing our wipes are hypoallergenic to help ensure my son's bottom will be left feeling clean without any other harsh chemicals. The unique softgrip texture helps us use less, while still ensuring a confident natural clean.	&&&
"Always use this products in my kitchen and bathrooms, particularly for sanitizing the counters and bathroom areas. I have used them to wipe doorknobs, toys and even small floor areas."	&&&
These wipes are soft on my baby's skin and have never caused any irritation. They are quite durable for cleaning tough messes and are perfectly moistened - not too dry or too wet. I like how a free wipe container is included in the large boxes of wipes.	&&&
"So helpful! Wipes boogies right out of the nose!"	&&&
"These were the first box of diapers we used on our newborn. In hospital they used pampers so for first time parents it was no brainer we just followed everything its done in hospital and brought the same brand wipes and diapers! lol! now i look back and see its the same with every new parent, we are all so freaked out!!
These wipes are thicker and moist without a scent. They do a great job and are very soft."	&&&
I use the wipes to clean surfaces in my home and I keep them in my car to use whenever we are out and about. I believe in cleaning surfaces to keep germs away! ToddlerMommy	&&&
I would really like to see this product in a value pack.	&&&
We love the spray but the wipes are not as good as the spray. They do not have the very fresh scent of the spray and seem to leave some streaks behind.	&&&
Love huggies wet wipes. They are affordable and get the job done, they do tend to tear easily however so you have to be careful with them.	&&&
Clorox wipes makes cleaning my granite counter tops a cinch. They do not leave streaks and they smell great.	&&&
We've used Target brand wipes with all three of our babies. Our youngest is especially sensitive and we haven't been able to find a substitute that doesn't make her break out in a rash. I decided to try these thinking even if they didn't work on her I could still use them on the older kiddos faces and hands. Turns out they work great for her as well! Been using for almost a week and no rash! They are thick like Target wipes and dispose one at a time without coming out in a hand full. They are a little on the dry side, but I prefer that over wipes that drip everywhere. The price is great too! These have been added to our auto delivery =) Thank you Amazon!!	&&&
This is the only brand of wipes i can use on my skin. always works and smells great!"}	&&&
This is great for any age and I keep them in the diaper bag, bathroom and both vehicles never know when you will need them!	&&&
Colorox wipes Works Great! We use it at home and at the office!	&&&
Although I feel kind of silly buying water in a box, these are very convenient. They work well and I don't have to worry about any nasty chemicals on my baby's bottom.	&&&
These wipes are very convenient. They provide a fast way to clean up and disinfect frequently used areas. A nice thing to keep in stock with kids. They clean and disinfect toys very easily.	&&&
if you read the ct., it says 105 wipes, that is all for containers! Each container only has 35 wipes; but in a way, they are more compact than 160 wipes. thanks for a speedy delivery, as the flu/cold bug hit our house 1 day before they arrived!"}},	&&&
I received a sample of Preparation H medicated wipes for women from Smiley360. I have tried other wipes and found them to burn. The Preparation H wipes were so soothing with them chamomile and aloe they contain. I also like that I can flush them. They are an amazing product that I would recommend to other women to try. The Preparation H medicated wipes left me feeling clean and the irritation was gone.	&&&
A few of these I open up to use, and the wipe is completely dry. Even though the package is sealed! Probably about 10-20% are duds	&&&
I love using these Clorox disinfecting wipes when I need to clean up and I'm either too lazy or too rushed to do a deep cleaning. I keep them in the bathroom and love using them I know they des infect and it helps me keep clean"	&&&
My youngest child is nearly 16, and yet, I still use baby wipes almost daily. These are gentle enough to use to wipe the tear residue from around my puppies' eyes, and they clean well enough to use on my wood cabinets (cream finish) to get splatters and splashes off. You should have seen my husband's face when the UPS man handed him this box. Ha ha!	&&&
These get the job done! With the scent added, you get the best of both worlds, clean and fresh!	&&&
Love the smell, price and effectiveness in cleaning the little one. I'm guilty of using them for everything from makeup removal to a quick counter wipe. All around best product.	&&&
When my little boy gets a runny or stuffy nose, this is the first product I run too! It keeps his nose from getting raw from all the wiping, plus it has a wonderful scent!	&&&
I love them! They are big enough to clean the mess and don't break.	&&&
These wipes work pretty well. There is certainly goof off in there, because you can smell it a little bit, but much better than the original. The wipe kind of foams up when you scrub and cuts through grease and sticky residue.	&&&
It's good quality with good price!"}},	&&&
Bought for my son and it works well. It always keeps the wipes warm	&&&
OK so Target has recently changed these wipes. The packaging was different and I bought them anyway like I always have for years. I thought they just changed the look of the packaging just because they can. Well when I used them, wow. They burned the corners of my eyes making them all red! I had to use a wash cloth after to help with the burning. Apparently the new wipes are botanic fibers. They are terrible and it seems like they added other chemicals! It works well but I cant take t he burning! I have to find new wipes now! I'm very disappointment because I love the Up and Up Brand!!!! CHANGE IT BACK TO THE OLD ONES!!!!!	&&&
The price is outrageous. Five times the price of a comparable Charmine or Cottonelle wipe. Really? Think effort you throw your money away.	&&&
"Light and non-greasy wipes, scent is clean and not too strong. 7.15% DEET is low enough that I feel comfortable applying liberally and not have to think about where to wash my hands in case I rub my eyes or mouth acc

The bag is resealable, so the wipes do stay moist, but each wipe is not individually sealed, so you will be lugging around a whole bag of wipes. It makes more sense for a whole family, which will go through a bag pretty quickly, and less so for a solo traveler, since a bag of wipes are quite bulky, and will barely fit in a purse (though you can easily chuck them into a backpack).

Being only 7.15% DEET, the repellent property is better than expected. I used it during a trip to big Island, Hawaii, where there's quite a number of bugs. I did get a few bug bites (there are definitely times where I should have reapplied but was too lazy), but definitely got far less than other friends who didn't bother with the repellent."	&&&
I love these wipes. They are the only ones we use on our baby's delicate skin.	&&&
These wipes are by far better than any wipes I've used and we've used quite a bit! 	&&&
Nice, thick, good quality baby wipes!	&&&
"Well bought these for my husband and I have been informed they do they job lol. Only complaint is the packaging but honestly not a big deal . He figured out if you pull them out slower they will come out individually and not in a clump. He said he does like these and would order again.
These were provided at a discount in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
I received this product as a sample to review from Generation Good and I am so happy I was able to try these wipes. I am usually wary about trying new products because my son has sensitive skin and breaks out very easily.I read the ingredients and saw that they wipes were hypoallergenic and did not contain fragrance & dyes.I like that the wipes are soft and thick and that they are also free of parabens & phthalates.I am really happy with this product and since then have recommended to family & friends.	&&&
Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes work very well. It cleans grease and everyday cooking residue efficiently with little effort. These wipes leave the stainless smudge-less and it also covers small scratches."}},	&&&
I felt burning around my eyes and returned them. All makeup removal wipes I've ever tried burn my eye area, and unfortunately these were no different.	&&&
I love these for the convenience and ability to kill germs on the spot!	&&&
They are perfect for any and all messes, especially convenient with having a dog, cat, and two rabbits. I use a canister a week because they are the best and easiest way to get pet messes cleaned up fast.	&&&
love this product! this product works great, very easy to use.	&&&
I don't have a problem with the wipes themselves, however, I was ordering them for a cat and the product did not specify they were for dogs. Basically wasted $20.00 because I can't return them. I don't have a dog.	&&&
I am beyond ecstatic for the return of these wipes - even if they're now named Member's Mark again. ;) Added plus - there's now 1,000 in the box - an additional 100 count more than previously, & they're still the same price!!!! Having triplets is a lot of work physically and financially...so finding quality at an affordable price is imperative!! These wipes stand up quite well to the warmer - a must use for me. They don't tear, they come out one at a time, and they're a fantastic all over wipe! LOVE, LOVE!!	&&&
love this product! it works great and smells great!	&&&
This is n excellent value. Each one of the lens cleaning wipes is packaged in a plastic coated packet. This keeps the wipes from drying out over time.	&&&
I have used these almost exclusively since my son was born. I use less of these than the other, knock off kind that I have bought in a pinch or used at a friends' house when I ran out. They are very gentle, yet thick and strong. I recommend them to all new moms.	&&&
these wipes clean the monitor screen very well. i like that the wipes come in this nice packaging. it looks good enough to leave out in full view. great price."}},	&&&
Great quality. Love the XXL size of the wipes	&&&
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT. ... I HAVEN'T BOUGHT ANYTHING OTHER THAN HUGGIE'S WIPES OR DIAPERS	&&&
Great Deal and High quiality.	&&&
These are the best, hard to find sometimes but keep them in the truck, at home, in lunch bag! Definitely convenient!!!	&&&
I belong to an organization that has adopted an elementary school and Clorox wipes are always needed in the class room. This is one of the items we help donate.	&&&
These are the only wipes we use in my family! They smell wonderful and they're thick and not watery like most brands of wipes. And we've used A LOT.	&&&
Five star wipes but way too expensive. Switched to water wipes.	&&&
Im a mother of four need I say more? Mess happens! so im glad i have clorox to help me clean up the mess in a very convenient way. Love these wipes they are a staple in our home.	&&&
Very high quality, thick, effective! I have four daughters, so I have experience changing lots of diapers. I love this brand! Such a great price through Subscribe and Save! I order these often!	&&&
Love these. The only ones I use.	&&&
These are not in a useable package with a closable top. We used them as refills for a bin we had. It still fits our needs. The wipes work great and they have a nice smell that can cover "other smells" up!	&&&
Got it fast and was better than expected. I am sensitive to overly perfumed products. This was no issue at all. My pups smell and look great between bath times now. Thanks!	&&&
"Disinfectant wipes are important around my space and I found that Staples has them at a very good price."	&&&
The wipes are so easy to use in daily cleaning... I love them!!	&&&
I thought I would try these out since they are a bit cheaper the earth's best wipes I have been buying. I am going back the quality is just not there. They dry out much faster seem to leave a residue on babies skin. And far less soft then the other wipes I have come to be used too. Along with these rip very easy.	&&&
I normally use Huggies Simply Clean. There don't compare whatsoever. I do not consider them premium wipes, just a premium price. I would compare the Amazon elements wipes to Target's up&up....I don't buy those because they're crap and very thin. Definitely unhappy with this purchase. I expected more, but got a box of nose wipes.	&&&
It's a cool idea, but the wipes are very thin and break apart easily and tend to stick together. I will stick with the generic wipes at my pharmacy that work just as well and cost less.	&&&
I liked that these wipes are unscented. My daughter didn't have a rash from these wipes. They are definitely strong wipes as well so it may not be as soft as other thinner wipes. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
"I use one every morning to clean my glasses. They work great and are nice and large for the purpose.
Handy to keep in my jacket and glove compartment too."	&&&
The only wipes I have ever used with my two children.	&&&
We love our pampers wipes!! The travel packs are great to keep in the car and the refillable tubs stay in our nursery.	&&&
"Huggies wipes in cucumber melon are the best! They smell so good. And for the most part the one and done slogan is very true. On occasion you must use 2 but not very often. These wipes are so soft but yet so durable. We use them not only on hineys. We use them for everything. I have an 8 months and 2 2yr old boys. Messes are everywhere. These wipes are the ""bounty"" of wipes.
The only complaint I would have is that sometimes they are to wet. The bottom of the pile is completely saturated and dropping practically. So I just leave the plastic bag open to let them dry out some and that seems to do the trick. :)"	&&&
As others have said, the original Earth's Best wipes in the yellow packages were the best wipes on the market. My wife and I used them because of hemorrhoids and these were soothing and never caused irritation. Now the new ones in the tan wood -grained packages are AWFUL! Smaller, thinner, less moist, with a quilted texture that irritates something fierce. The old design didn't bleed through and had a slipperiness to them that allowed them to glide across and not irritate. Hain Celestial Group, this new wipe is one big mistake. Why would you even think of ruining a great product that had great reviews?	&&&
This is 3 big packs of wipes they are not individually packaged and so unless you put them in containers or seal in a ziplock bag they will loose their wetness.	&&&
These are the best hand wipes. They are individually wrapped. Easy to use, great for my purse and for traveling. I love the scent but most of all I love the Clean, Refreshing feeling of my hands after I use one. I use to buy them in the store but they don't carry then in the store. It is worth having them sent to me.	&&&
They are pretty flimsy and tear easily. They smell great but when my little one got a hold of them she tore it to pieces	&&&
There are differences between wipes despite what others may say. These are thick and durable. Cheaper wipes can be thin and rough on baby's skin.	&&&
Removes makeup without leaving face dry	&&&
I love these wipes! They smell really great and are gentle on my skin. I've re-purchased them multiple times and will keep coming back. They do remove most eye makeup, but for my waterproof mascara or eyeliner, i use the take the day off eye makeup remover from clinique first, and then these wipes to clean up the oily residue that remover can leave behind. The package can get a little gnarly and the wipes at the end of the package can get a bit dry by the end if you don't seal it tightly after each use.	&&&
Love these wipes. Moister than the huggie brand I purchased before.	&&&
"I love the Lysol products and have used them for years for all of my disinfecting needs throughout my home. Recently, I purchased a 3-pack of the lemon-scented Lysol wipes. I wanted to use them at my office since I share my office space with another co-worker. What I've noticed about the wipes is that they are not as moist/wet as other wipes. The wipes themselves are nice, and thicker, than other wipes, but when I've used the wipes to wipe down my desk, phone, vinyl chair, computer keyboard, and other office items, I have noticed small, fine little "hairs" or cloth 'fuzz' from the wipes. On another note, the lemon scent is mild, and not too over-powering. I think I'm going to switch to using these wipes in the bathroom!"	&&&
The warmer does in fact warm the wipes, but they are extremely difficult to remove from the container. Even with just a few wipes in the dispensor, I had to use two hands to remove the wipes. Sometimes I had to pull the wipes hard enough that they stretched or ripped. It didn't matter if I used brand named wipes or store brand wipes. I am looking for my reciept to return the item. Not worth the hastles....purchased item to make changing time quick and convenient.	&&&
These wipes are my favorite!!!! I am a mother of three so I have used many different brands. These wipes are thick but not too thick. They are moist but they do not leave the babies bottom too wet. I have found Amazon to have the best deal on this particular brand. I highly recommend these wipes!	&&&
We used these toothbrushes to make gift bags for the homeless in our town...sturdy..and reasonably price. * fast shipping too!	&&&
We really love these wipes for our newborn...first of all they have othing "extra" in them to cause reactions to her skin! And, they aren't as WET as other wipes...other wipes get so wet and cold that they bother her but these are the perfect blend! Highly recommend and won't use antyhing else!	&&&
Love it! Easy to refill, love the clean modern look of the box. Wipes mostly come out one by one - i think it has just been bad loading by me when they come out a couple at a time. Keeps wipes fresh and moist and easy to see when you are getting low. I am happy!	&&&
My daughter has extremely sensitive skin and these wipes are the only ones that do not irritate her.	&&&
Love waterwipes. No chemicals and soapy residues that can irritate baby bottoms, but far more convenient than make-your-own wipes. My pediatrician recommended wet paper towels and that just wasn't feasible with one hand in the middle of the night. Very happy with water wipes.	&&&
I like the value of this box especially using subscribe and save and these smell really nice. I wish there was as good a deal for wipes that scored a bit higher on the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep Database which rates products on their toxicity. They get a decent rating. The only ones that get a really good rating are like the water wipes (friggin expensive and why???) and babyganics (still more expensive than id like and the reviews aren't as good). My kid only poops once a day so compromising on these toxicity wise works for us. If that is less of a concern for you do it they're great!	&&&
"After trying out 2 other warmer this one was better but still not the best. I find it to be bulky and the wipes are warm/cold. Wish it was a little warmer but like I stated better than the others. I have the Lion organizer and this warmer does not fit on top :("	&&&
I don't care for these wipes. They are not thick enough, and they fold and bunch up while I'm wiping my daughter's booty. They get the job done, but they're not my favorite! (Pampers Sensitive Skin wipes are!)	&&&
They are the best wipes by far.	&&&
Love the product. Easy and convenient to have around	&&&
These wipes were great! They didn't burn my eyes like some do and they didn't make my skin break out. I use these every night before bed to remove my makeup.	&&&
"These wipes are great. I used them everywhere in the house. Great for cleaning bathroom and kitchen. It's easy to get the grease off the stove top, and microwave. It's pretty good with soap scum and mirror in the bathroom, too. When someone gets sick, I just wipe every single door knob with this wipe, and it has helped virus from spreading. I also donate this to the classroom as well. It's thick enough and quite durable. It's something we always keep at least 2 - 3 in the house. I would definitely recommend this product."	&&&
I love there wipes like every other wipe by pampers!!	&&&
I was really surprised by the scent and as usual very satisfied by the disinfecting!	&&&
LOVE this warmer! My only advice, ditch the pad you place in the bottom. It smells weird and turns colors. The warmer itself is amazing and I love the cloth wipes it comes with!!  	&&&
The Lysol wipes are so convenient. AND the dispenser actually works! Part of my Amazon Prime delivery.	&&&
"We've been using these for 8 years - so portable and useful! My son has always loved the fresh scent and never fights having his nose and face wiped with them! They are gentle and we love having them handy for all kinds of uses. Always in our cars and my purse."	&&&
Love having a disinfectant wipe to use when cleaning. Lemon / citrus flavors are the best!	&&&
Awesome price for such a huge amount of wipes!! (The wipes come in separate bags (each bag has Huggies code for points)! Sometimes the sheets are hard to separate from one another, but they are very moist and great for cleaning babies bums! :)	&&&
I picked up this product because I had used the regular kind in the past and liked them; it's comparable to the Neutragena remover wipes and slightly cheaper. I don't get the 'radiance' effect but my skin doesn't feel greasy or gross afterwards. I only with it took off make up a little bit better, as the regular kind def does, but if you use the eye make up remover first, this will take off most of what that may have missed.	&&&
There was 400 wipe it was new it was in a few other smaller boxes .it worked I think they were out of the 400 cases.	&&&
Not sure how we lived without this for so long :P They really are super gentle on a sick cranky toddler's nose!	&&&
The red top comes loose and dries out the wipes. I have retired this item.	&&&
"My daughter prefers th grape scented wipes. She had a runny nose for a week and after using tissues, she fought me every time. Once I started using the Boogie Wipes she has not fought me once. They leave her nose moistened so she doesn't get the red, sore nostrils and she likes the smell, therefor never fights me wiping the "boogies" away."	&&&
Excellent price. Product seems to work as advertised . The product does not leave any smell on equipment	&&&
Disinfectant wipes are important around my space and I found that Staples has them at a very good price."}},	&&&
Very happy with these wipes easy to clean up any spills easy to wipe down counter tops and easy to wipe down door knobs love the fresh clean scent"}},	&&&
Great for cleaning up after messy kids. Disinfects and leaves the surface clean and the area smelling fresh. Makes me feel confident that the area is clean after having a sick child. Clorox wipes are the product I go with most.	&&&
Love these wipes! My daughter can use them independently to clean her sink, saving me time.	&&&
Very soft and handy for many uses.	&&&
I used to swear by these, but they've been hit by the shrinkray!!!!! the new ones are only 7x4.17 inches, and are paper thin! They're also harder to get out of the package. I'm SO MAD. I have sensitive skin and nearly everything causes ezcema. WHY WHY did a good thing have to change??!!! Stay far away from these if they're in the yellow packaging!!	&&&
Great Product that delivers outstanding performance. This product is always my go to when it comes to kitchen and bathroom clean up. No comparison to the off brand.	&&&
I have used a complete box of wipes and have decided to chance to the more sensitive one. I feel this product may have too much scent.	&&&
I love it I didn't have to buy any wipes for two months	&&&
Lousy paper packaging for lousy paper hand wipes. Minimally effective.	&&&
I use clorox wipes every day! its so handy to use them, I feel safer knowing things are disinfected and my family\u2019s health is not going to be intruded upon by some nasty germs. I think these have helped a lot. I go through at least one 35 container a week!	&&&
"I mean, they're Clorox Wipes... I'm not sure what else to expect, but they're great.

From cleaning and polishing tables to cleaning the white rubber on my shoes, they're truly great.

They will reek of an odor when first used, but you will slowly get used to it and slightly love it!
(Means it's squeaky clean!)

Handy to use in college instead of water and a papertowel, and way less effort!"	&&&
"This clean my glasses better than any other product I have ever had.

At first it seems these wipes make smudges but then you realize that they are just removing whatever residue was previously on your lenses. After your second wipe, your lenses are perfectly free of residue and these are just amazing!"	&&&
I loove buying these in bulk at Costco. They last me a long time and are great for everyday use and clean up. They also stay moist very well."	&&&
It does help soothe, wether there's an itch in the private area or a stinking hemorrhoid. It doesn't make them how away but does help with relief.	&&&
I ordered these for my grandchildren to use. They wear their crocs outside and before coming in the house they wipe off their feet, legs and hands. I like them because they are all natural and safe to use on the children. They are a nice weight and don't tear easily while using. The pop up dispenser included in the box was a nice surprise. The children can tear one off and open and close the lid with ease. I would recommend this product!	&&&
"I tried these 3 times for overnight wetting and they did not stay in place.
I donated then to the local SPCA, I hope they can use them for ""puppy holding"" by potential adopters or something."	&&&
My 5-lb male Mini-Mutt is 12 years old now and, sad to say, has never fully achieved full housebreaking status so we "roll with the flow" (again, no pun intended) so this product really fit the bill. I have tried several other dog wraps--both disposable and washable (yuk!) and have decided to stick with these. They are extremely simple to attach and dispose of and serves the purpose quite well. They are very absorbent and the tabs to attach are easy to find and use. Great product!	&&&
These have been wonderful for my son to use. They have been a big help for him to be independent.	&&&
Easy to use. Good, clean smell. Can use practically anywhere. At home, in the office or daycare! Gives cleanliness a fast easy alternative to sprays!"	&&&
These diapers r ok they worked best for my baby at birth but when baby got bigger I seemed to be changing his clothes ever two hours ask he was soaking right thro them	&&&
I dont know what I would do without my Clorox Wipes! With a house full of children, these wipes help me keep my home clean and safe for my little ones.	&&&
I received a free sample from smiley360 and I am so happy that I did! I gave birth about 3 ½ monhts ago and this was something I was so happy to try! You feel a difference after the first time using the wipe! I never had any problems with hemorrhoids until after giving birth, but this product really does help and I would HIGHLY recommend it! I am happy to be able to use them on the go too, you never know when you will have a flare up!!	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. I have bought them for my son since he was born. I started out with these because I have very sensitive skin and I was being paranoid. But now that I see how well they work with any messy situation for baby, I would never go to another kind. I recommend them to my friends and my sisters who have babies and young children as well. We all use them and love them very much! They are sensitive enough we don't have to worry about our kids putting them in their mouths( which with my son is something he loves to do) but durable enough we only need one to clean up most messes!Hiighly recommend!	&&&
After childbirth I tried one of these wipes (not Prepartion H) and they burned. These actually didn't bother me as much as the ones I tried before. These actually helped me find relief. They are great and work just as the product said it would. I would totally recommend these wipes and will be putting them in my friends baby shower basket.	&&&
Do not like the new packaging. Go back to the original package ......do not like not having ziplock closure........I know it's cheaper but really............	&&&
I ordered these because they got great reviews. They work great and I was looking for something to put in my purse to clean my glasses and this worked well. It comes in zipper packs to easily keep where you need them, purse, car, etc.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes. They have the best texture and are thick. It typically only takes one wipe to get the job done.	&&&
Love these! Buy all the time, Packaged well, but this container was not sealed under the cap. Checked out, and seems to be fine though.	&&&
Try on pimples and bug bits as well as bottoms for soothing relief and reduced swelling.	&&&
What can I say, they are the only wipes I will use on my little guy. I have tried other brands and have always come back to these. We have pretty much used them exclusivly since he came home from the hospital two years ago. They have the perfect amount of thickness. Other brands are thinner and have torn apart. You don't want your wipe thin when you are cleaning up a big poo!	&&&
I work in a very dusty environment, so I keep a few of these individual packets in my pockets all the time!	&&&
They have very little smell to them, and are very thick. They definitely get the job done without all those disgusting baby scented chemicals.	&&&
I received these complimentary from Walgreens. They smell really fresh, but when i used them, they felt greasy & almost slimy. They did however remove all of my makeup. I might purchase a package to try them again.	&&&
I love being able to get something as natural as this. Some of the cheaper generic brands don't always take into consideration the delicateness of a child's skin. These are great not only for diaper changes but as face and hand wipes and a quick clean up. My little guy is a messy eater and these are great for just after meals when I need a quick clean up to get him out of the chair and on to the next thing. They're gentle to his skin and I don't see any redness forming from irritation after use. I love these.	&&&
Love the clean feeling after the counters are cleaned with Clorox disinfecting wipes!	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! It doesn't matter what kind. They are super convenient and clean really well. They even remove crayon off my toddlers table. Clorox wipes are a cleaning staple in our home.	&&&
These wipes lasted a long time, I think you should buy these everytime if you want wipes, saves you money in the long run.	&&&
These Wet Ones Sensitive Skin Hand Wipes are great for people who are sensitive or allergic to perfume (there is no noticeable scent). Also, the main ingredient is witch hazel, which is less drying to skin than the alcohol found in most other wipes. I have been buying these for years because my family has multiple allergies and skin sensitivities. Highly recommended. I also buy the individual Wet Ones Sensitive Skin Wipes to keep in my purse.	&&&
If you're hesitant about spending $20 on a wipes holder, get over it and just buy it. With the first use, I had my husband apologizing to me for calling it a waste of money. So nice to have your wipes stay put! We just started cloth diapering, so I'm using cloth wipes and this works perfectly for them.	&&&
I used to love this product, but last time the wipes I ordered smel funny. I don't know what's wrong with the smell. Never have this problem before with my pampers wipes	&&&
Great product I all was use it and recommend it to family and friends	&&&
These were the first box of diapers we used on our newborn. In hospital they used pampers so for first time parents it was no brainer we just followed everything its done in hospital and brought the same brand wipes and diapers! lol! now i look back and see its the same with every new parent, we are all so freaked out!! These wipes are thicker and moist without a scent. They do a great job and are very soft.	&&&
"These wipes are super easy to use, they smell fabulous. I keep a container in my bathroom and use them everyday to wipe down countrrs, sink, handles, everything. I know everything is clean and germ free. My kids use them also, finally something that encourages kids to clean."	&&&
love having wipes more than antivbacterial lotiion	&&&
I use the first aid beauty facial cleanser and the face pads and I love them they clear up my acne so fast so I got the makeup wipes hoping it would be just as great but I was very disappointed because didn't remove a lot of makeup the only thing that it remove was my blush and I have try drug store brands makeup wipes that u can get for like 5 dollars that work much better	&&&
I love to keep Clorox wipes on my kitchen counter to quickly sanitize whenever I need to!	&&&
I really can't get enough of these awesome wipes. Their always moist breakable free. Very good for my family	&&&
I pick up the wipes and clean. Fasted and easiest way to clean	&&&
These wipes used to be the best on the market. Not sure what happened in the past 4 months. I had stocked up on the previous version of these wipes which were superior to the competition. The latest Kirkland wipes are low quality, as it appears that costco cut costs...much thiner the the previous versions.	&&&
I have a history with clorox& it works when nothing else will.	&&&
awesome works great use all the time since I have a child	&&&
Excellent wipes	&&&
"These wipes work wonders for daily use, but I've also found they do a pretty darn good job of scouring out the older, more ingrained dry ink that can set in on older, used white boards.

You definitely don't need them for routine, daily use, if you have an eraser. But, they, of course, are excellent for that (though obviously a waste if you have an eraser and your white board is still responding well to that eraser) - especially at the end of a work day, when you're all done with the board for the day and just want to make sure it stays clean and the more stubborn dry ink doesn't get a chance to set in."	&&&
I use this everyday as my main disposable and reusable wipes container .it holds enough wipes to last me a day and it keeps them moist!!..i do love that its portable and you can plug it in the car!!!!!...as a mom on the go i need simple and effective yay to this product oh and the cord is nice n long :)	&&&
Great to keep the hands clean during travel. And not full of chemicals like most sanitizing wipes. These use alcohol.	&&&
Wife runs a daycare and these things are gentle are kids noses.	&&&
Hard to go wrong with these - It's the brand that everyone trusts, and the price beats local stores, hands down. They work like they should, are thick enough to do the job, and hold up for everyday use. I've compared to all things local, including cheap, store brand wipes, and these still win.	&&&
These aren't bad. The one main complaint I have is that they do not come with any type of plastic seal. It is just the plastic top between the wet wipes and the outside of the container. This caused them to leak some inside of the packaging, but not enough to make much of a mess. I do worry about the extra containers leaking though since I typically throw a spare into my bag. I have had some that have a tear off airtight seal and I wish these did. Overall they have been ok to use and I haven't noticed that they are drying out any faster than other brands. I would buy them again, but I would not seek them out over other brands or pass on trying something new.	&&&
Convenient product for grab-and-go usage. Cleans well and leaves a nice after scent.	&&&
I've been using these wipes for 4 months and they are great. They are thick, which I love. They are really soft and great whether or not your baby has sensitive skin. It's great because there's no purfumes and it doesn't dry the skin.	&&&
Best wipes to use for quick cleaning jobs! Much more durable than alternative brands.	&&&
These wipes are awesome. I originally purchased them for my daughter who was getting uti's at the suggestion of her urologist. I started using them myself for yeast infections and they have helped both our issues. Anything that clears up issues without the need for drs visits or perscriptions is a bonus!	&&&
I have tried many different brands of wipes and these are by far the best. I temporarily changed to a cheaper brand and found that I used more than twice as many wipes to do the job. I prefer the natural care because my lo's skin has a tendency to chap very easily.	&&&
"So soft! I know when you think of bamboo you think of a hard stick, at least I did. But when I opened
these up I was so surprised. They are super soft. I intended on giving these as a baby gift but will probably
end up keeping these and purchasing another set as a gift. They are really wonderful. The colors are muted
baby colors and have a soft shine to them. The package is super cute as well and makes a great gift.
I am really impressed with how soft these are. Once we wet them down and tested them out well all agree
they are just as soft. They are not flimsy at all, very durable with clean, strong, straight stitching around the
edges.
I received this item at a discount or free fro my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
After trying out 2 other warmer this one was better but still not the best. I find it to be bulky and the wipes are warm/cold. Wish it was a little warmer but like I stated better than the others. I have the Lion organizer and this warmer does not fit on top :(	&&&
For sensitive eyes these are the best and least irritating cleaning wipes that I have found.Love them! Will buy again.	&&&
This product was pretty bad.These pre-moistened wipes were all dried up,causing me to buy a bottle of screen spray.What a waste of good money!"}},	&&&
It is a really good product and really helps getting any dry boogers off your children's noses. We know how annoying that can be.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes on a daily basis. This is an amazing product that is easy to use when cleaning a large or small area."}},	&&&
I love the Clorox Wipe with the dual cleaning sides. There is a scrubbing side for hard to clean surfaces and a smooth side for easier jobs.	&&&
Clean great, smell nice and are very good at cleaning spills and messes on the countertop.	&&&
I LIKE THE WIPES BUT THEY ARE TOO HARD TO GET OUT OF THE CANNISTER.	&&&
Pampers Sensitive Wipes are great, since we've been using them for our son, we never have any issues with rashes. And its been great to clean up his face when we're out and can't use a washcloth. and they've been great to use cleaning up messes on our couch, rug and his playmat.	&&&
"Been using these wipes for 3 years. They are wonderful, and they get the worst crusty boogers off so easily!"	&&&
Wipes are okay but if you need softer ones for your baby's skin, then don't go for this. Otherwise, it's okay and will come handy for the raining days. The price is okay too.	&&&
Loved the wipes for my daughter after gymnastics but she hated the smell. All in all the product was great	&&&
I was really indifferent with these wipes because they were all that we bought for the longest time. I recently purchased a different brand and will go right back to these. They are much better than the competitor that I tried. These stay together when pulled through a wipe warmer and allow me to separate them after the next wipe has begun to be pulled through the rubber grips. The competitor wipes I tried were perforated and ripped as I pulled the wipe through, so the next wipe never made it through the gripper. These also do a better job of retaining moisture and whatever cleaning agent is used. I also think the wipes themselves are stronger, not just the transition from current wipe to next wipe when being pulled through a wipe warmer.	&&&
Its truly cheap and amazing. Was great for potting training my daughter	&&&
love these wipes i keep them on the back of the toilet for easy cleaning and disinfecting.	&&&
"I would recommend"	&&&
I love using these wipes. I wipe down my grad daughter toys and high chair with them just about every day	&&&
Bery Convenient, quick and easy to just grab and go.	&&&
with a toddler these are easy to use. they get my messy jobs done in a flash and I can toss them in the garbage when I'm finished and go!	&&&
All the products are great products. Use them for everything.	&&&
Im sure these wipes are fine for dusting or spot cleaning but they are pretty much useless for mopping with a swiffer mop. I bought these as a quick, easy way to clean my wood floors and these wipes certainly do not do the trick. The package says they fit swiffer mops but they just barely fit and they are so thin that they rip after 2 swipes across the floor! What a disappointment.	&&&
Great make up wipes. Exactly as described. Arrived quickly.	&&&
I really like this product. Easy to use only one thing that my husband complains the strong smell of Clorox. But other wise its good product.	&&&
I try to use these on a daily basis as a way to disinfect common areas like doorknobs and light switches to avoid spreading germs, especially during cold and flu season.	&&&
I was skeptical about these but decided to try them because of the packaging... easy to toss in your diaper bag, purse, stroller, anywhere. After my kiddo's first cold, I found out how invaluable these are! The saline makes it just a little more tolerable on sore noses AND it helps break up the crusties that grow as they feel worse. Do they magically love to have their noses wiped, no. However, it does make it so you're not scratching at their face to get the buggers off.	&&&
I don't know why other mommas arent using cloth wipes if they use cloth diapers..I love them.	&&&
these wipes are pretty great but you dont really need ones to be that big. its pretty wasteful and i have to cut them down to size so i dont use them up all the time	&&&
Very good product! Simple to use works wonders on just about everything!	&&&
Clorox wipes are amazing my kids love to use them great for flu season I use in car at school everwhere	&&&
I always use the wipes at my work they are tuff and easy to use, i buy them for my house too.	&&&
Tried another brand and it was not the same, wipes were too thin. Had to go back to Huggies. Will not traded it.	&&&
As a teacher I love to use Clorox disinfecting wipes in my classroom. I have them within reach of my students and they help keep our classroom fresh and clean.	&&&
We used to buy the huggies wipes and they didn't seem to work as well as the pampers wipes. Keep in mind we have two girls so that is the only gender experience we have with using these wipes. I like them because they don't rip while you are wiping - gross. In the end you have to find the product that best fits your needs, but we have found these to work well for us.	&&&
"Why I Hate Clorox and Love Lysol
My normal disinfecting wipe was always these Clorox wipes. I loved them and almost always had some around. Then they changed the formula from nice mild smell and wipe to "" Great on Kitchen Grease"" and now it smells and feels like EasyOff, it stinks and stays on your skin.
I could not understand why they would change something that people loved for so many years ( at least keep the old formula too ) so I gave Lysol a chance and I'm happy with it.

I have used these wipes for so many things. Nothing could be more convenient, I keep some in my car, and at work too.
They are great to clean: Phones, Cars, Desks, Chairs, Tables, Handles, Light Switches etc

They remain moist down to the last cloth provided you don't leave it open, They will freeze if you leave it in your car when it gets very cold, but will thaw out so no worries.

I wish they will bring back the original formula"	&&&
These wipes work excellent. I had recently purchased another brand & it did not work very well & were more expensive. At my eye doctor they cleaned my glasses with these & she gave me some extras, so I wanted to buy some. I saw the reviews & most were really good, but some were not & there were complaints regarding packaging. Mine came neatly packaged in three boxes of 60 as pictured & another 20 wipes in a small handy clear purse or travel pack. Very pleased with my purchase.	&&&
Its a great product, we will always use this product it has been around since I was a child.	&&&
I love pampers baby fresh wipes. They are very sensitive to the touch and they are hypoallergenic.	&&&
Worth every penny especially used in the bathroom and kitchen counters (after working with chicken)	&&&
"this product gets the job done and was on sale - even better!"	&&&
"My little ray of sunshine really hates having her nose wiped, except when we use Boogie Wipes. Her little skin is already so sensitive, rough facial tissues can begin to give a burning sensation especially when you have to wipe her nose frequently (and you can tell because it becomes shiny red...instead of my little ray of sunshine we get Rudolph's girl twin!). The coolness of the wipes must be soothing because she'll sit still for a moment longer than usual to let me wipe her nose."	&&&
when im in hurry I just use the wipes and Im done thanks to who ever invent them.	&&&
These wipes are great for packing in a lunch, in the car glove box, in your pocket, just about anywhere if you need to clean your hands. I prefer these wipes over the liquid bottles, because not only do they fit better in your pocket, but you can use them like a washcloth if you need to clean a surface. The seller was great, very fast delivery and exactly what I ordered.	&&&
I just started using these wipes about 2 months ago because I found such good deals on them. These wipes rip easily. I lost count of how many times I ended up with stool on my fingers because the wipe tore. If they didn't rip while wiping, then they rip when pulling them out of the container.	&&&
Best wipes ever to clean your face. So happy that i purchased them	&&&
I love them. My dog loves being pampered every morning with these wipes.she stands, turns and hold he paws up to be bathe. They leave her smelling fresh and pretty. Then she's on to getting her coat and teeth brushed.	&&&
Like these wipes. Smells good and durable. Good deal for price	&&&
My mother who is 82 years old was given some of these when she was in the hospital and love them. Little did I know it would be so hard to find. But after just a few simple clicks there they were right here on Amazon so now my search is over and my mother is loving them.	&&&
These are the BEST wipes. My baby has extremely sensitive skin, when she has a rash these are the ONLY wipes that don't make her scream when they touch her. They are so soft and are unscented (I think unparfumed is a better way to say it) but smell so fresh and nice. They don't always separate easily but I noticed that's usually when you just open a pack so they are stuffed in there. I highly recommend these, I no longer feel guilty to the point of tears when wiping my baby!	&&&
I take these in my pump bag wherever we go. Just remember to wipe the parts directly after pumping because it takes 10 minutes to dry before you can use the parts again.	&&&
"I really love that I can easily carry them in my diaper bag. They also seem to be gentle and non-irritating, perfect for my toddler.

Best used with this awesome diapers: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DFFT76U/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00DFFT76U&linkCode=as2&tag=theworscooash-20&linkId=T53XCDCTPH4AESBF

Hope my review helped!"	&&&
Nice to use. Large size. Nice convenient container.	&&&
These diapers were very good but they are just too expensive. Found another brand which are much less. Lower your price.	&&&
I love huggies wipes. Personally I don't like this kind as much as I like one and done. But there is more quantity with this one. I can use less wipes with this brand during a diaper change than other brands. The only down side is I use a wipe warmer & sometimes when taking a wipe out to use they rip."	&&&
biggest complaint is tht they do not come apart easily so u end up pulling multiple wipes out of the package at one time (when bought in bulk, i do not know about smaller sized packages)	&&&
"Like all the other recent reviewers I used to love these and now hate them.

I compared a package of the new version they sent me side-by-side with the originals (both 72-wipe packages) and it only takes up about 40% of the volume. That's a 60% reduction in the material, meaning that each wipe now contains less than half the material it used to. You would need 2.5 of these to equal one of the originals.

That difference REALLY shows in the wipes.

They're now so thin that instead of a solid sheet, they're pressed into a hexagon mesh-pattern that has small holes and gaps between the hexagons. It has enough holes that you can see through it, and I don't mean that as a figure of speech, I mean you can literally hold it up and see what is on the other side of it through the many small holes in it. There is NO WAY you use this on a baby's bottom and don't end up with poo squeezing through.

The product is now so fundamentally different that leaving it with the same name is actually dishonest.

I don't know what data Earth's Best used in this decision, but the savings on the materials can't possibly cover the cost of the customers they will be losing. Seriously, I use them for wipes, diapers, rice cereal, food - they've pretty much positioned themselves as the primary supplier of all my baby stuff. Now I have to go out shopping for wipes again, and after this experience, wipes probably aren't the only product I'll be comparing around. Seriously, what happens when they start dropping the quality of other products so drastically? Especially something like the baby food. See ya...

It's almost enough to make me reconsider the Hain Celestial in my stock portfolio - are all of their brands run this way?

UPDATE: I ended up with Babyganics wipes, which are as good as these used to be.

UPDATE 2: Actually, the Babyganics feel weird, like they're too dry, and they have an unpleasant chemical stink. Looks like I'll be shopping around again..."	&&&
Great value, cleans excellently! Much cheaper than the box stores or even the wholesale clubs in my area.	&&&
Hey guys.. this is the perfect personal care item for any guy's toiletries. A must have for men who want to feel clean after using the restroom. Be sure to take this with you on travel too.	&&&
Regularly ordered on subscribe and save. Go through at least 4 containers a month in my pre-k classroom.	&&&
One & Dones are the only way to go. I used various other types and they are just not the same. These are more heavy duty and stronger than other types.	&&&
While I like the idea of a wipe for deodorant, this really doesn't work. It almost feels like you are wiping off the product and the wipe seems too big/waste a lot of it. I would say these are great for touch-ups during the day to freshen up a bit. The coconut smell is light, which is nice. Overall I like this, but would not recommend for someone who perspires a lot.	&&&
No more rash... these are so gentle. Pop top lids work well and are convenient.	&&&
My infant son recently had his first cold. He was sneezing often and snot would come out when he sneezed. The wipes are gentle and effective. They are sensitive so their soft skin doesn't become red after multiple wipings.	&&&
I have used pampers sensitive wipes, and sometimes huggies brand wipes until this came out. I liked the pampers wipes better than the huggies wipes because the huggies wipes were too dry, and they were perforated, which is a pain. But the pampers wipes were very wet. Amazon basics wipes is the perfect medium. Not to wet and not too dry! I also like the recloseable cover on the Amazon wipes.	&&&
I received samples of these wipes for the purpose of my review. Now I will be honest and tell you that I'm hesitant with wipes. I have tried numerous brands for my son and get consistently frustrated with how many I need or how easily they tear. These actually stand up to the test! I only need 1 to 3 depending on the extent of the mess, unlike the 5-10 I was using before (my son has VERY messy diapers.)! They also don't tear easily....and I seriously yanked and pulled in all directions on a wipe to test this!	&&&
we like these wipes; however, they are kind of thin. even though i still like them. they are natural wipes.	&&&
BEST WIPES EVER! These are the only wipes I will buy. We HATE Huggies wipes, which tear when you use them. Pamper wipes are so soft and gentle. This is a great price for the amount of wipes you get. We purchase this box every few months and will continue to do so.	&&&
"Wife's skin seemed to have a negative reaction to these, but I didn't.

Wipes dried up in the case before I got a chance to use them all, which is weird considering all the trouble they went through to design this."	&&&
"The wipes do not stay warm for a long period of time. If I leave to the doctors by the time I arrive (its only 10 mins away from my home) the wipes are already cold. Its very frustrating for me as I bought this thinking that the wipes would remain warm for a min of 2 hrs. Another thing, the wipes tear/break if you try to extract them through the shoot. you must open the compartment and it can get messy especially if your LO likes to move a lot. Remember wipes do stick together and unless you use both your hands you might end up wiping your own self clean."	&&&
I bought these for my girlfriend and she says that they are her favorite and best she has ever used. She is very pleased with the product and has been the only ones she has used since then.	&&&
This product is not ready for the mainstream. Barbara Corcoran was right when she said it was too thin and flimsy. Terrible product with no real world application.	&&&
I love wiping down my counters with Clorox! They are good for a germaphobe like me!	&&&
I like the smell of their products. The smell makes it seem like it is getting surfaces very clean	&&&
it's not bad, but because it's not air tight, the wipes dry out faster. the pop up door works great with one hand, though.	&&&
i don't care what you say about baby wipes, these are a must have for kids! they clean off all kinds of stuff from mucus to food. i have even used them instead of baby wipes in a pinch.	&&&
Not the best quality wipe for the price. Wipes are thin and I end up using more then I would like per diaper change. Scent is nice, wipe is soft but the last few wipes in the package are saturated!	&&&
I only buy Huggies brand wipes...I really love the shea butter, and the green tea and cucumber	&&&
These wipes did not do the trick for me. I still have a prominent line running thru my scanned items. Not sure if its another issue but I feel that these wipes were not sufficient in cleaning the roller, etc.	&&&
I love the disinfecting wipes. They are easy to use and spell great!	&&&
I love this product! It is easy to use and helpful when I need to go traveling. Using this, we can keep the baby stays clean and fragrant during the trip.	&&&
Love them!!! They help keep my home daycare sanitized, children aren't sick near as often and it's a breeze to use after the kids leave.	&&&
We have a full house with multiple animals. These are the easiest way I've found to clean up slobber/accidents/etc. and know that we are disinfecting as well.	&&&
These wipes clean up the messiest poops with ease and without having to scrub. they do not irritate babies bottom either!	&&&
Good for quick wipe ups and for furniture that's laminate fake wood.	&&&
They work OK but like the Flents Rinse Free Eyelid wipes better	&&&
Sensitive wipes rule	&&&
Best wipes for my baby. Thick and durable. Scent is light and I like to have these everywhere I go to wipe hands and faces and messes!	&&&
Uuum . . . are these for wiping up baby cream ?	&&&
Keep your ass smelling and looking clean!	&&&
Love the wipes but not the scent.	&&&
"This product is solid and clean up messes really well, but my biggest pet peeve is that they have a funky kind of smell. The packaging for the individual wipe pack themselves are not suitable for putting in a baby wipe dispenser. As well, they don't ship in an Amazon box and the Pampers box itself is shipped as is (they just stick a mailing label on the Pampers package and send it).

This was my 2nd time buying a box of pampers baby wipes, and my first time that I bought baby wipes from Pampers, they didn't smell and each individual package had an opening that fits and worked very well with baby wipe dispensers.

My Disappointments (upon comparison to a previous Pampers product I bought from Amazon)
1) They have some type of scent/odor.
2) They aren't suitable for use with a baby wipe dispenser
3) They aren't shipped in an Amazon box, but they just put a mailing label on this Pampers box and mail that.

My takeaway here is that if you don't care about the smell about a baby wipe dispenser, go for it. Personally, I'm going to pass and try to find the style/type that I first bought before."	&&&
We love these wipes. They are watery/moist enough to really clean up baby poops without rubbing too hard at baby's soft skin, therefor, no rashes!! Plus the ingredient list is so minimal compared to all those other brands packed with unnecessary ingredient. Definitely my favorite wipes and I have used them all!I know there are a lot of reviews complaining how the next wipe does not pop up. Solution to that is when there is a poopy diaper just pull out 4 or 5 wipes ahead of time and lay on top of the wipes so they are easy to grab and clean up! Not a huge deal!	&&&
Love Huggies diapers, hate Huggies wipes. The wipes tear easily like toilet paper, sucks when you have one hand holding a squirming baby and trying to pull a wipe from container and it just tears. Sticking to pampers wipes.	&&&
I keep a container in each bathroom and the kitchen for easy clean ups. I also save with S&S	&&&
these wipes are soft, and smell good. They do seem to wipe "boogies" away better than the average tissue.	&&&
Love these wipes! They take off all my makeup, and feel gentle on my skin. Smell is clean and fresh. My favorite!	&&&
I just received this a little late in the season to apply to my boat cushions but I did get a chance to use this on my sled. I applied this to the seat of my sled and all the hard plastic molding. It really put a nice layer of protectant down and did not dry out like others do. The sled looks great for 13 years old and I can't wait to apply to the seats of my boat. The only draw back I saw was with dispensing the wipes from the container. I could not get them to come out one after the other and had to keep reaching in to start the next wipe.	&&&
Car litter has always been an issue for me, it all starts with a napkin or a straw wrapper, but eventually it turns into a big mess. With this car trash can, trash has a place to go where it can be taken out just like trash anywhere else. This works great for me, is fully leak proof... Highly recommended!	&&&
These disposable washcloths are great. All you do is add water and wipe. My wife and I received these for our child when he was born in the hospital. They contain no fragrance and are great for sensitive skin.	&&&
I am a member of Smiley 360.com. they had a challenge to try out the new Preparation H Medicated Hemorrhoid Wipes for Women. I was able to share with the ladies in my office the coupons in case they needed them. The compact size of the product makes it more portable and discreet.	&&&
Great	&&&
Good value, works great for the office to clean the phone, my mouse and wipe my desk down to be germ free!"}}];	&&&
I keep these at my desk for work-they are amazing. They clean and sanitize very well! The scent is minimal, and they are easy to keep are your desk. They also stay moist indefinitely-which I can't say for other brands."	&&&
With a 4 yr old and 1 yr old I use these multiple times a day, every single day. After every meal there's a mess that these things tackle easily. I love, love, love them. Plus they smell nice and clean.	&&&
Just what I expected and received quickly!!	&&&
gets the job done	&&&
They don't cause any redness or rashes. I've been using them from birth and recommended to all of my friends with babies.	&&&
The huggies one and done are very thick so you don't have to use so many wipes. You can really clean your baby better.	&&&
I love these wipes and we have tried a few, even other pamper lines. I just like the way these feel in my hand so I definitely feel comfortable using on the little ones bottom."	&&&
They work okay but prefer a different brand.They feel a little slimy. I use them for my mother and she didn't like how they made her feel.	&&&
These are really great if you are taking care of baby. I think that's what they are for. I was after a quick clean up little wipe for when I'm eating in the car etc and these are really big and have a kind of hand lotion residue so I actually don't know what to do with them at this point.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are so quick to use and cleans up very well. With Amazon's 15% discount on subscriptions, this is often cheaper than Walmart, and you are getting them delivered into the deal.	&&&
These are so handy and have a great scent	&&&
This wipes would rip almost every time I took them out.	&&&
Fresh, soft and super strong. Like other pampers products, little pricey than other brands, but good.	&&&
So convenient and I love the scent.	&&&
Love the scent! Works great on eye makeup too. Leaves skin soft and clean.	&&&
Awesome wipes! Moist, and great on babys skin.	&&&
"Worked effectively to wipe away boogies and had a pleasant scent."	&&&
These wipes are the worst. They are soaking wet right out of the bag and fall apart when I tried to pull them out of the case. I had to let them dry out or leave the case open between changes. My baby girl would get horrid diaper rash. Note: We use GDiapers and change her immediately and let her air out and dry before we put the diaper back on. My baby sitter suggested Pampers and so we switched. Those wipes are thicker, less moist, don't fall apart and we haven't had a rash yet.	&&&
We are using these in-between bed baths, to freshen up at the end of the day, etc. Very easy, very convenient (we even used them while my husband was in the hospital)....and most important, they're very gentle on the skin.	&&&
"These makeup remover wipes are unique to any that I've ever tried and in a very good way! One side features an exfoliating wipe to clean the dead skin away and bring out your beautiful, healthy skin, while the other side is more gentle for areas such as eyes that need makeup removed.

The ingredients include vitamin e, Aloe and many others that are safe and healthy for your skin to not only clean your skin and remove your makeup, but moisturize it as well.

I received this product in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
Great for quick clean ups, keep them under all the sinks	&&&
Very soft, exactly what I was looking for. My face is very sensitive and it loves these extra soft washcloths.	&&&
Great wipes. No streaks or water marks. Used them for years. Wish they were slightly more damp as they dry out when cleaning anything larger than a camera lens or pair of glasses. I use several to clean my laptop screen.	&&&
"Disinfects the surfaces that you have to touch everyday."	&&&
"buy these for my grandson,Huggies seem to do the best for him."	&&&
Love these towels so much. Bought them for my toddler and was nervous they would be too small, but they are the perfect size and very soft. Planning to purchase two more sets and use one set for my face!	&&&
great product fast service	&&&
Love work great so much better than spray or those cloth things	&&&
Love these wipes! You get TWO packages of these wipes, each with 30 wipes. They're so good, you only need ONE wipe for your entire face worth of makeup. They have these little exfoliating dots all over them which really help to get all the makeup off. I normally have issues with eye makeup remover burning my eyes but this is a very gentle formula. They smell great too! *sample provided for review*	&&&
"We used these when we were moving to a new office, they did a terrific job on everything!"	&&&
In my opinion, Huggies make a superior wipe. They are durable wipes and clean well. Works well on sensitive skin.	&&&
Prompt, great value	&&&
Doesn't do a good job removing makeup, I have to use two cotton balls of toner after.	&&&
These are the only wipes that work for my two-year-old. Not trying to be graphic, but he is "tar baby" where that is concerned. I used to use huggies natural care disposable wipes on him, but they really did not work and he would end up crying from sore skin after the 15th wipe. I wet these with warm water before use. I usually need no more than three wipes to get him completely clean and it is so much gentler on his skin.	&&&
I really love the Pampers sensitive wipes. They are the only ones that don't irritate my baby's sensitive skin. I have tried other wipes that claim to be "sensitive" and none compare. I definitely recommend these wipes!	&&&
Wipes work great, would recommend, not much to say.	&&&
Use on planes because people are disgusting. I wipe down my entire area- window, seat belt, tray table, arm rests. The wipe is black with human grossness.	&&&
Love these touch up wipes!!! Using them on my induction cooktop range and they work great. Got these via delivered quickly and free with Amazon Prime membership!	&&&
I tried other wipes first, these are the ONLY ones that did not cause a rash on my newborn. That was 2 years ago and I continue to use them and will do so for my second child. The major difference between these and Huggies are that Pampers are more moist, which I prefer and feel like it picks up more mess. It's really what you prefer. The price is amazing, and worth it, especially if you do subscribe and save!	&&&
This is a great product. Small packets are ideal to keep in the vehicles, back pockets, and wife's purses. Disinfectant sheet is large enough for big hands yet tough enough that they do not shred while using. Packets stay useable for at least a while year.	&&&
Came a day later but i was informed immediately by amazon that it was going to come late. Very happy with my product! Very convenient and makes it easier to clean up the mess my son makes lol thank you...but i would say that with the shipping fee you dont save anything its as if you went to the store and purchased them.	&&&
It seemed like overnight my little one decided she no longer liked the nasal bulb or nose Frieda. These wipes help me moisten the nose and then I can wipe away the boogies!	&&&
Easy to assemble, easy to operate, compact and small not too bulky. Really empressed with the vacuum aspect. It actually sucked up the dirt and short pet hairs off of my white tile floor and it didn't just spit it out the sides and spread it around like most do on hard floors. I'm impressed with this little machine all the way around! Gave it 4 stars instead of five only because it takes a while using the "dry" feature but WELL WORTH THE MONEY! Would definitely buy again!	&&&
I bought a few of these and am completely satisfied with my purchase. I prefer Pampers over Huggies. My hands don't have that film feeling after touching them like other wipes. Its easy to get them out in a hurry. The only down side is I can't take the tub with me because its bulky so I suggest a wipe dispenser or the Pampers Kadoos. Very happy with this purchase.	&&&
Too be frank I have always used baby wipes since the 1980s. They are great to keep in your duffle bag/ shoulder tote they are safe to use after clean up ie' ."cleaning make- up off your face in a pinch,freshing up from leaving the gym or wiping your hands from a fast drive thru lunch in the car. I purchased these in the multi-package because it was a good offer from the vendor/ amazon. Amazon bulk sales tend to be a better value than driving over to Costco/ Sams club. Remember please don't flush your wipes down the toilet...	&&&
Yes, they work with removal of the adhesive. Just could have been bigger	&&&
"Love this. Cute, functional, and reusable. It hardly takes up any room in my diaper bag."	&&&
I am unable to use these without immediately following it up with fresh water to wipe off the sticky formula they use. Sorta defeats the purchase of having them.	&&&
I got a free sample of these wipes from Smiley360. All in all, they work well. For me they tingle a little in the beginning...I'm assuming from the witch hazel. Price wise...I'd have to have a good coupon for them to purchase any more.	&&&
"I've been using these for a few days as makeup removers. They're quite effective at that -- they take off both waterproof mascara and lipstains easily. They have a large surface area so you could use them on your whole face if you wanted. The two sides have different textures; one's a little rougher and better to use away from the eyes, while the other side is smooth.

I'm iffy on the smell. It doesn't bother me, but I could see how it might bother some people.

My wipes were a little bit dry, compared to other wipes. They were still wet enough that I could use them to remove makeup. However, they were dry enough that they didn't transfer product (i.e., whatever was wetting them) to my face, so I am doubtful about the anti-aging benefits. Have to get the product to your skin before it can have any effect, after all.

Here are the ingredients, since they're not currently printed on the product page:

Water, Glycerin, Coco Glucoside, Olive Fruit Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Gluconolactone & Sodium Benzoate, Dehydrated Acid, Citric Acid, Grape Seed Oil, Grape Extract, Chardonnay Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Squalane & Ubiquinone, Rosa Centifolia Flower Water, Palm Oil, Ascorbic Acid, Black Currant Seed Oil & Carnauba Wax, Algae Extract & Pullulan, Fragrance (Tangerine & Vanilla).

Note: this is the same ingredients list found on several websites, but it's in an odd format (normally there are not & signs between terms, and online it said ""sodium benzonate"" which is not a chemical that exists -- I have a PhD in chemistry -- plus I have no idea what ""dehydrated acid"" is). So take it with a grain of salt.

I did not find my face oily after using these, but I typically used this as a first step before a regular cleanser, which may have washed away any residue. These did not irritate my eyes at all, which is nice.

In the end, these are OK but I don't believe the claims about anti-aging, they're a little dry for me, and I'd probably still want to use a separate cleanser afterwards."	&&&
This feels like a quality item and looks nice on my bathroom counter. I like the seal around the lid and the weight inside to keep all tissues from feeding out at once. Thanks OXO.	&&&
I chose this product because I would rather avoid using insect repellants that contain DEET when ever possible. This product is new to me, and I bought it to take with me while traveling, Haven't used it yet, so will need to come back and report on how well it worked	&&&
We love using the pampers sensitive wipes. They are soft, no perfumes or dyes.	&&&
Without going into full detail, these flushable wipes are a life saver for international travel. For both on the plane (yes, you can keep these in your pockets or carry-ons when going through TSA security) and for rural countries that don't have supplies available in the public facilities, these little packs are an absolute necessity. They are convenient to carry and conceal, and they stay fresh and moist with the resealable sticky-tape cover. They easily fit in most inside jacket pockets. With 10 wipes per pack, they last for several calls of nature. One tip: Be courteous and dispose of these in sanitary bags instead of sending them down the airplane toilet.	&&&
Great price, superior delivery, thank you.	&&&
A great product and a great value all around, especially at the subscribe and save price. Would buy again. Like having lots so i never run out.	&&&
And found the best. a few other wipes I have used have left streaks, these do not. I keep them in my car, truck, and on my job. My wife does the same. We appreciate how good they really are.	&&&
I do not give these 3 stars because they do not work.. On the contrary they work quite well I have been using them for almost a year... And in that time I have been searching for a way to buy them in bulk or perhaps from another company that is priced better. No such luck. these are just simply too expensive! Recently I had a baby and my husband and I were sitting in our living room diapering up our two chihuahuas (in diapers that are exactly the same as the diapers I put on my son except for a tab being on the end instead of the side, oh and they are 10 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE) so I walked over to my sons diapers grabbed one and put it on my chihuahua, I had to tuck under some extra fabric but they worked great! So wiki wags are wonderful but if you want to save a BUNCH of money... Grab a box of pampers :) sooo glad to be free of the hold wiki wags has had over me!!!	&&&
This is a wonderful wipe for cleaning silver and making it shine.	&&&
Just alittle to tight packed !	&&&
i would recommend these to anyone- the price was cheaper than an off brand- they can be used on adults also	&&&
I buy these all the time and have them everywhere in the house. My daughter has a continer in her room and she is always cleaning everything. love the different scents and not too expensive when you buy them in bulks. I like the fact that they can also be used on toys!!!"	&&&
"I am using this as a wallet. No one will rob my wipes dispenser.
I feel safer now. Thank you"	&&&
Best price I could find but they are not super durable. After having multiple wipes tear (one getting my hand into the present I was trying to wipe off) I have learned to wipe without straining the wipe, sometimes using more.	&&&
These are great! I took a pack on a 15-day Grand Canyon/Colorado River rafting trip and they were my salvation - the only way to really clean myself up.	&&&
"I GOT IT THINKING THAT IT WILL HELP WITH TAKING SOME MARKERS OF THE STAIRS

BUT IT DID NOT DO THE JOB BUT ANYHOW THANKS"	&&&
These are great if running water isn't easily accessible. I use them for camping or when I'm out of town. Or when I'm too lazy to wash my face.	&&&
YOUR BABY WILL NOT HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH THIS PRODUCT AND FOR THE PRICE IT IS OK	&&&
These are the best smelling wipes ever! They are also nice and thick.	&&&
I used these all the time growing up for chores and they were a lifesaver in college, especially when it was time to move out. Once the rag is full of dirt, rinse it off and reuse it. It goes a long way	&&&
Refreshing way to clean off your makeup before bed. I've been using these for years.	&&&
Sent to a free clinic in the Caribbean--they were well-received.	&&&
ok.. I don't know if my kid is different but oh boy, my baby girl can... ummm... well, she can use a lot of wipes! As a first time mom I tried different brands, different kinds, and these are the best. They stay moist (they don't dry out) even if bought in a case, they do the job, don't tear apart, simply the best. Really, I'll do you a favor, forget other wipes exist and just buy these, you'll love them!	&&&
These are a waste of money!!!! They are barely moist so using one does not do the job. Don't waste your money.	&&&
Love that there organic they smell and feel great especially for my boy	&&&
I always have one in my clutch bag and it always comes in handy.	&&&
These are fantastic - they are soft, they have some pattern to help with wiping, and they are just wet enough and consistently wet throughout the package (some wipes are dried out on the top and bottom, these were not). I also love that Amazon is so transparent about the ingredients and where these are made. We will definitely re-order these.	&&&
i love clorox wipes with my 2 yr old that touches everything in sight these wipes are great to clean and disinfect so he doesnt get sick	&&&
Love the consistency of these wipes. Not counterfeit.	&&&
I love the radiance cloths even better than the original ones, and they are great too! These seem to leave a healthy glow to your skin in addition to taking makeup off quickly and easily. And no scent!	&&&
Good, affordable; as stated on the product, it is sensitive to the skin. Does its job and very convenient; A must have-- especially if you have children that likes to make messes or dirty themselves!	&&&
The singles don't appear to be in the stores anymore. They are handy to have in your purse or car.	&&&
My wife loved these and they were great for traveling. Spent multiple days at the pool and no sunburn for our baby!	&&&
These are great wipes. I recommend using the smaller "fancy" refillable containers with the rubber surrounds on the ends.	&&&
Can not be without	&&&
great wipes and they come in 3 packs with a box to put the wipes in.	&&&
huge! Works as expected!	&&&
Great for kitchen cleanup without toxins.	&&&
my wifes uses these and leaves them in all the bathrooms and kitchen, even i can use them	&&&
Use these on every thing from glasses, cell phones, camera lens and even on my entertainment/navigation screen in my automobile.	&&&
terrible quality, even jagged edges, no way i'd let be around a baby	&&&
"First things first, and the reason for the lack of a 5th star - The box in which the wipes are stored is a very flimsy quasi-cardboard thing. It is not in the least bit substantial, and I paid the devil trying to get the tab in the slot for closure. I am not necessarily in favor of plastic, but a container with a little more substance would be appreciated.

As to the cleaning capability of the Clorox Triple Action Wipes, no complaints at all. Although I do think they are overreaching with the whole ""Clean the whole room with one cloth"". If you dust daily, or maybe every other day, and have a small room, with no pets...okay, maybe then one wipe will clean a whole room. For those of us who are not compulsive dusters, you can probably count on 2 cleaning the room.

I was most impressed with how the wipe grabbed up all of the dust on my TV stand, with one pass. The stand is black, and seems to attract all the dust in the immediate available area. I have a real love/hate thing going with that stand...the Clorox Dust Wipe may tilt the balance firmly to the love side.

I have tried MANY of the comparable products on the market, and this one is, hands down, the best one I have used. The surface of the wipe is a little sticky, not so it sticks to your hand or to the surface, but it does grab the dust up without spewing the dust particles back out into the air. There is no residual dusty smell, either.

Bottom line - I like this product, and will be incorporating it into my cleaning routine. It actually works, with one swipe, no wiping at the same spot over and over. I would absolutely recommend the Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes."	&&&
The pads are so thin I can only do a paw at a time, before it dries up.	&&&
"I always use it for stove and it cleans well."	&&&
"I received one as a baby shower gift and when found out was pregnant again didn't hesitate to buy another one!"	&&&
"this was a really good deal and they clean up and disinfect really good... they smell awesome also. forget buying them at the supermarket or anywhere else for that matter... this was a good price also and beat my local supermarket. Ill be trying the other scents soon as we get through them. you can buy these individually but for the best price get the three pack. they also have the other scents in singles but again but the three pack and save big. I especially like the lemon fresh smell left behind after you clean up a mess."	&&&
Love how these remove ALL my makeup and are alcohol free!	&&&
I have had these for several months and I still have issues with not absorbing water.	&&&
I love that this is made by a WAHM and is local to me! One cube makes a lot of wipes solution, doesn't get slimy or smelly, and leaves my baby's skin soft and smooth. Great product!	&&&
Came fast great product for price	&&&
"cleans and smells great, I use them all the time"	&&&
I use these for my dogs hotspots that pop up periodically. It seems to soothe the irritation and has a nice smell.	&&&
i use these wipes to clean the kitchen and to wipe out the tub after a bath.	&&&
At first I was skeptical but tried them and they are awesome. Cleans the nose and face so much easier and kinder on little noses.	&&&
"After exercising.
After tanning.
When too tired to use facial cleanser and water before bed."	&&&
These little wipe are a life saver.I had a flare up while I was away from home and all I had to do was go in my purse and get easy to use wipes which smells great take care of the problem.	&&&
I've used the typical car cleaners quite often and some grip into grime better than others. However, upon cleaning some old leather chairs myself, it is not only strong, but it lasted with a sheen on chairs for over a week (vs. days) and went over 6 chairs when others did 3 or 4. A client runs an executive office cleaning service and know he wants it for his buildings. Hands..together, applause for an awesome product. I'm done trying what's on sale."}},	&&&
Have used these for years and love the convenience of them. Can slip in a pocket, purse, luggage or, in my case, saddlebags for use on the trail. Don't know why the stores stopped carrying them, but wish they would re-think their decision not to. Must say I'm not a happy camper about it! Hate not being able to pick them up when I'm in the store. Besides, now I have to pay shipping. PLEASE BRING THEM BACK TO THE STORES, SAM'S!!!	&&&
I bought these wipes very impulsively. I wanted face wipes that I could use in a pinch for those nights where I'm just too lazy to fully wash my face or when I'm traveling! I also use waterproof mascara. Always. And up until now, I haven't found more than one brand of face wipes that fully take off my mascara without irritating my skin from rubbing :( I used these tonight (the night after Christmas) to take my makeup off because I was so tired! At fi rst, when I tried them on my waterproof mascara, I wasn't impressed. But with a little more patience and gentle rubbing, it came right off! I did use two wipes though just because I felt weird rubbing the one with my makeup on it over my face again...I used a second one just for leftover cleanup and much to my delight there was a VERY minuscule amount of makeup on it! My skin also feels really soft and clean with no strange residue leftover! I highly recommend these for anyone looking for an easy clean up for a lazy night or to freshen up after the gym, while traveling what have you. These are great! Will probably repurchase!	&&&
Was going to try to use for cloth wipes. Generally useless for any kind of wipe. Save your money. Ended up reusing the white huggies wipes bins once empty. Closes well with a good seal, but otherwise, bleh.	&&&
I have been using Seventh Generation baby wipes for several years. I believe they are the best wipes. They are thick and gentle. I always recommend them to my friends."I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
Great to keep in the bathroom for quick clean-ups!	&&&
We have been using these wipes for over a year. They work very well, are soft, and have a good amount of moisture (not too wet, not too dry). I recently tried the Honest wipes while visiting family and if Seventh generation could combine the slight texture of honest wipes with their current product they would be absolutely unbeatable. I still prefer Seventh Generation over Honest but taking note from Honest on the texture (which can help with removal of soiling) would improve these wipes in the only remaining way possible. I did receive a free sample of the wipes through Generation Good for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
Keeps wipes so warm! My baby enjoys diaper change because I dont use cold wipes on him no more! So easy to install, clean & use!	&&&
Good wipes gets the job done	&&&
Love these wipes. I love being able to order a large amount and have them delivered to my door. The fresh scent is so pleasing and smells so clean and soft. The wipes are strong and durable- we have even washed a few by accident that came out in the same shape and not torn up. We have used Babyganics, Pampers, Up and Up from target and these are by far the best wipe, scent, and strength for the price.	&&&
I didn't love these at all! They fell apart and they leave a ton of lint	&&&
"the scent is great and the product, Lysol, is great, but perhaps it's this 3-pack packaging that arrived with the outside of the containers quite wet"	&&&
I keep these in my car, kitchen, and bathrooms. They are easy to use and also smell good!	&&&
"Great for quick clean ups in the 3 bathrooms when the grandsons visit !"	&&&
yuk...not good...too wet and not enough absorbency in the cloth..	&&&
Wipe away the germs and clean all in the same wipe.	&&&
We use Clorox wipes for the entire house! From the kitchen counter to the floor. These wipes are great to clean any size mess.	&&&
I have been using this product for years. Used to love it. It appears an ingredient has changed. I had a horrible allergic reaction. Was told by my dermatologist that they added a new preservative. Please go back to old formula.	&&&
These are a great supplement to reusable wipes for those extra messy situations. No rashes or irritation.	&&&
It has been the perfect solution for keeping my hardwood floors in sparkling condition cleaning up after two medium sized dogs.	&&&
This helps my wheaton terrier not bite his paws after walking outside.	&&&
I have been using Huggies diapers on my kids for years now No other brand compares to them< my mother used nothing but Huggies as well. As far as the wet ones go I don't like them they rip to easy and I go through more of them due to them ripping. So I prefer another brand. Pros on the wet ones They stay moist and get the job done when they don't rip...	&&&
2 tubs came open (lid off) and the wipes inside dry.	&&&
Great wipes! This pack came with enough so I won't be running to the store by the end of the week or even month.	&&&
I love this Hoover. It is great to see how dirty the water is once you clean the floor. And it is so easy to use. I actually enjoy cleaning the floors now. Definitely recommend.	&&&
I received these today, but the stitching isn't multicolored like the photo shows. I have 5 each solud green, purple, and red. I wish I had received what I ordered. I can't find any contact info for the seller.	&&&
Got these because I had tons of streaks on my stainless steel appliances that were not coming off with just a washcloth. these work perfectly!	&&&
After two months of use, the top won't always stay locked down. Very annoying when you want your wipes to stay wet.	&&&
Excellent product!!!!!	&&&
I recently tried these wipes. The packaging caught my eye first, and while reading the label I liked that these are not only all natural, but vegan. I'm not vegan, but I just liked that these were. The price was right, so I grabbed them to try. While using, I LOVED the scent, but I also like that it didn't stick on me after I was done with the wipe. The wipe was nice and soft on my skin, not harsh. I've used the Cucumber wipes from Yes To Carrots before, and those felt very scratchy to me. These removed all my facial makeup, and did an ok job on my mascara and eyeliner, but I have yet to find a natural wipe that takes all that off, but I usually finish up with lotion for eyes so I don't rub too hard. I also like that unlike other 30ct wipes, these lay pretty flat so they're easier to travel with. Overall, I give these a 5 and will be permanently adding them to my regimen.	&&&
I truly love these and they work great taking off makeup! I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review	&&&
These wipes come in convenient travel size package. They fit perfectly in small purse. They are antibacterial moist wipes. Sample received for evaluation.	&&&
These wipes are perfect for sensitive skin. They have a nice light scent and do the job of removing makeup and refreshing your skin. They are perfect for frequent travellers. Plus I love that my purchase also helps a good cause!	&&&
These are honestly the best wipes we've used. I know other reviews said they dry the skin out too much, but we haven't experienced that at all & my daughter has fairly sensitive skin. I think the only downside (which isn't even a big deal at all) is that sometimes you get two wipes that seem to be sewn together.	&&&
Great product! No overwhelming scent and doesn't rip apart like Huggies wipes.	&&&
I knew nothing of these wipe cases until I watched you tube but I'm glad I ordered them. Not only do they keep my wipes moist with no problem   they are slim and flat making then easy to fit in a diaper bag, diaper clutch, purse or whatever without taking up a bunch of space. I love it now if only I could find a buti pod cover	&&&
like the softness of the papers wipes compared to huggies and others.	&&&
I love that these are chlorine free and we used these exclusively for our newborns first couple months of life, I took a star off because they stick together. They rarely come out of their dispenser one at a time.	&&&
It's good at repelling dust on lenses	&&&
smells wonderful. not so great for cleaning the matt, but does freshen it up :)	&&&
This product has a great scent and feel, but i found it just pushed around my makeup especially around the eyes. I just had black all over my face. It took 2 wipes to actually seem like the makeup was removed, but I coudln't trust it, so I end up having to wash my face after. I like wipes that get everything off with one wipe, this was not it.	&&&
"Toilet paper is great...admit it, toilet paper is an underrated invention. Without toilet paper life wouldn't be quite as sweet...especially if you're as full of...as I am. Anyway, why didn't somebody come up with this idea years ago! These things are amazing. I used to use other brands but they stopped making the individual packets. I tried Dude Wipes and damn! these things rock! They're big, they're strong, they have aloe and vitamin E so they are ""gentle"" where you wipe the most. Best of all is the individual packet that is easy to carry, keep in the car, take on backpacking trips, the boat etc. Let's face it, when you get used to using wipes and then you don't have them...you just don't have the fresh, clean feeling.

Try these! They're worth every penny."	&&&
I received one as a baby shower gift and when found out was pregnant again didn't hesitate to buy another one!	&&&
I'm pretty satisfied with the Honest Company wipes, but if you're looking for a way to try out a few brands and see what works best I recently found a site that will allow you to test different brands of a product (wipes/diapers/etc.). That might be a good solution if you're still figureing out what you like best. It's called StorkBox: www.storkboxdelivery.com Doesn't look like they've launched yet, but their offering a discount code for when they do.	&&&
Really like our new wipes, great for on the go for glasses. In the car for sunglasses and for the TV .	&&&
These work as well as any brand I've grid. The scent is light and pleasant and they don't leave any kind of sticky feeling. Great for traveling.	&&&
Best wipes you can buy and they smell really good too! Only wipes I buy any more.	&&&
I love the smell of these wipes. The only downfall is the large container. They also make spray hand sanitizers which are great for the purse or car.	&&&
I really enjoy the wipes I've only used them once but they didn't irritate my sensitive skin so for me that is a huge plus. I like that they have two sides depending on what I need to use.	&&&
This newer model of one I had before lived only a short time. It died today, of motor failure. I would like to have one that works. My previous identical model lasted well up to about 10 years. It was used in exactly the same way. Obviously they have "cheapened" it up and no longer does it have a good life.	&&&
Great to take with. Keep some in my purse at all times. These don't dry out.	&&&
Love Wet Ones in Single Packs. I don't go anywhere without them. They stay wet in the foil pouch and are lightweight and easy to carry several in a pocket or purse.	&&&
Arrived when promised. As pictured	&&&
This being our first little one I want only the best for her- so bought these toe begin with. I like that there are no perfumes or unnessesary ingredients. Trying to go all natural I tried cloth wipes, but they just werent for us. Then I thought I would save some pennies by buying the cheaper off brand wipes- What a mess!!! They were always ripping and it took twice as many to clean up a messy diaper. I buy in bulk from amazon which saves a little and my little one and I are clean and happy!	&&&
I got these wipes when i got a lavk in my welcome box for creating a baby register, and love them ever since. Tried other brands and they give my daugther rashes from being overly wet. These are just right, no rashes. Forgot to order and tried parents choice and huggies it was horrible. I will never forget again! These are my go to wipes noe, and love the two day shipping right to our door.	&&&
Great product! My 15 month old son had a bad cold and these unscented boogie wipes kept his little nose moisturized and clean the whole week he was sick. I used these wipes in conjunction with the Charlie Banana reusable fleece wipes since those are soft as well. This is definitely a staple to my discerning collection of baby products I use on my son.	&&&
This handy little tube holds alot of little towlettes, and you can buy a few and place them through out your home so you can have them handy to clean any of those little messes. As a mom of two I can tell you being quick to clean up a mess is a must."	&&&
They really work great with my baby. Didn't harm him at all, they did keep him moisturize and with a good smell.	&&&
These wipes are a great help to new moms; they clean well, and are infused with witch hazel and aloe- a soothing combination. I also like that they offer the option of being individually wrapped, for those desiring portability.	&&&
This product corrupts coating of glasses. Deleting does not be immediately apparent. It is understood that at the time of the coating is broken. I had two glasses of the coatings.	&&&
This product is exactly that we needed! Our beautiful Scottish terrier was starting to have leaking problems- even just for reassurance times- and these wraps are perfect!!! No leaks in between potty breaks outside- we were able to take this wrap off- and then put it back on (when not soiled). Very absorbent, excellent design, secure, and comfortable for boy. Highly recommend!	&&&
Love this product it cleans great and smells awesome I use them ever day and for just about everything being a mom this is great to use "	&&&
Soft, damp, durable... everything you could ever want in a butt wipe. Works well on little baby butts and big adult butts. We keep a box on the back of the John just for the adults. That's real.	&&&
Uh, these are baby wipes. I am an adult and I use them instead of toilet paper just in daily life. They are what you would expect from a wipe.	&&&
I haven't used them on baby yet but they're very very soft and I ran them under water and they seems very absorbent	&&&
Great product I leave one in every car we own. The don't dry out and work great. Can't got wrong for the price	&&&
My dog is 16 barreling towards 17. He just can't hold it like he used to. I was skeptical when I bought these, but they have turned out to work great. They aren't as absorbent as I would like, so I modify them by putting in a maximum (#5) Poise pad. The pad is the exact same size as the inside of the small size wrap. I tried maxi pads first, but they weren't absorbent enough. The thing I like best about these wraps is that they are easily adjusted to fit my little guy's waist just right and can be used several times thanks to the perfect fit of the Poise pads. If the Poise pad happens to fill up or spill over, the wrap serves as double protection. My baby's belly stays nice and dry - and so does my carpet. Check these out - they're great!	&&&
they are the only one that doesn't give a rash to my baby. all other I've try make her rash horrible. so this ones are the best for sensitive skin...they are also very affordable"	&&&
Excellent chlorine free and unscented wipes. 2 thumbs up	&&&
lets face it nobody likes something cold against their skin so why use a cold wipe on your little one during a diaper change? the wipe warmer pop is very convenient to have around	&&&
Very thin and flimsy and like paper even when wet. I do not recommend for the baby.	&&&
"I have these wipes in our vehicles and in the bathroom at home. They are a great value and do a good job."	&&&
Great for quick clean ups.	&&&
"Great product"	&&&
Product as described. Thank you!	&&&
The wipes are amazing. Having tried generics that we received, I continue to use Pampers. They are so soft and gentle for the baby. She enjoys them as well.	&&&
We don't have kids but these wipes are so great for so many things! We keep them in our car and in the house, they are handy to wash your hands off with, or our furbaby (puppy), etc. Love that they don't contain harmful chemicals.	&&&
3 for the price of barely 2 nice!!	&&&
Grandaughter loved it for her new baby he hated cold wipes and these warm ones made him and her very happy.	&&&
These washcloths are great! They are super absorbent and just the right size to carry around in a diaper bag so that you have a good cloth without taking up too much space. When you have two babies, you need to conserve space in the bag! They have always worked well everytime we've needed them, and even use them more at home now to wash for bath time! They are so soft too so my boys love it on their skin, and they don't make their sensitive skin break out like others have in the past. Definitely going to keep buying more as we use them!	&&&
They smell nice and do their job. It takes a few wipes for tougher "messes" but the baby seems clean.	&&&
Amazing wipes for sure, all around. We have luckily had no rash or issue with these wipes. We would only use pampers sensitive wipes from here forward. Our first child in February has only been wiped with these. Great clean up and no issues with harsh wiping on our little one. Being new parents we were given a great deal of diapers and wipes and quickly found that pampers sensitive wipes out perform anything else ..... Period !!!!!	&&&
i used affresh on my stainless steel appliances and it worked very well.more than i expected.great product.hoped it wasn't as pricey.	&&&
Good wipes, but they are in 2-packs with perforations between so they aren't as handy to grab and go as pictured.	&&&
Useful for quick clean ups like spills. But I needed them for baby bottoms and these are a lot thinner than what I buy at the grocery store. Don't know what makes thinner but that must be why they are so cheap. Going back to grocery store Huggies wipes.	&&&
This is GREAT too take off all your makeup, even that hard too get off Mascara!!!This one doesn't have a harsh smell like some other brands that is one of the things I love about this product.	&&&
use these all the time. very happy with these effectiveness and whatever is on them does not irritate my skin. almost everything else does.	&&&
I was amazed at how well these wipes worked. My two year old decided that my new leather office chair needed a little drawing on it and wrote all over it with a black pen. I immediately tried to wash it off with everything I could think of. I even tried hand sanitizer. Nothing worked. I tried one of these wipes and with a little rubbing it was able to get it all off. This is an amazing product. It saved my new chair.	&&&
I have the not fun task of cleaning 14 years worth of grease, gunk and who knows what else off some kitchen cabinets. Other products I've tried just didn't get the job done. I read the glowing reviews on Amazon and bought this. It came last night and I started using it this morning. I am impressed! It took a little elbow grease, but 14 years of build-up, what do you expect? It really works! The wipes clean a large surface for their size, and left the wood shiny and clean. I also really like that it conditions the wood. With regular use, the cabinets will be a snap to keep clean and beautiful.	&&&
These are great to keep in the kitchen and each bathroom. They make clean up quick and easy, especially with kids!	&&&
Not the quality I expected. small surface area and not too moist.	&&&
Works great. Cheaper than Wal-Mart.	&&&
As a mom of 4 these are my go to wipes!! I have some in various places throughout the house & vehicles!! I'm sure even after potty training is achieved I will still need these!"	&&&
I love this because my diaper bag has the pocket on the side to hold wipes with an open slot that fits thit perfect. I never take the wipes out of my diaper bag therefore I never forget them.	&&&
I use these everyday! With 2 kids, a bunny, and 2 dogs running around the house they are always needed!!	&&&
perfect for the chef who has all stainless appliances in their home. very convenient and easy to use. i keep them under the sink and use them once a week on all my appliances	&&&
I received this as a free sample from Smiley360, and let me tell you that it worked wonders.. Very good product that provided instant relief.	&&&
These smell amazing compared to other makeup removers. However, they seem to make your face sticky and stiff. I don't recommend.	&&&
I use it pretty much every day, this is the must have product if you have kids for disinfecting the bathroom and the kitchen table"	&&&
I have a container of these in nearly every room. I love have convenient they are and they make the room smell so clean afterwards.	&&&
If there is a chance your pet could have an accident while out or even in your own home this is the item to get. Very easy to use, work well, don't make any noise, but let's you relax while visiting, lets you be able to converse and enjoy instead of watching your pet every second.	&&&
I use these everyday! Being a beautician is a very hard job to do and stay healthy all the time. The amount of people we are touching constantly and the flow of people we coming in and out, I mean, who knows what kind of germs they have.....	&&&
This is a great smelling doggie wipe. I take them with us all the time and we have a dog that is still getting car sick. The only complaint I have is that it won't snap shut so have to use the inner seal to keep it closed. Don't know if I just got a defective one or what, but really like the wipe.	&&&
Perfect for potty training and beyond! These made it fun for my son to use and keeps him clean. Works great for my daughter as well.	&&&
I use these wipes on a daily basis from wiping down the bathroom to the kitchen counters and dining room table. They are great to always have on hand to sanitize whatever surface you need to work on!"	&&&
Love the button because the lid pops up and you don't have to worry about touching anything if your hands are dirty. We use water based wipes that are free of chemicals but they don't come in travel size packs, so this is great for the diaper bag.	&&&
cleans well, smells good, but could me more durable.	&&&
It is a great product and works very well. It keeps the little one calm when late night changes occur.	&&&
This is a great product. I use this on my four year old. It works very well. I will keep on using this until she is able to clean herself properly	&&&
I love how this item does keep wipes warm better than any other warmer I have owned. But I hate how the warmer pad always bet scorched. It seems like I would wet it every day and it will still scorch. The once a week per directions are beans. They do offer a warmer pad holder but this will not work with our wipes but might be an option for others. As much as I hate the scorched bottom it does work great!	&&&
"Best wipes out there! We use Luvs diapers because they are much less
Expensive but I cant go
Without pampers wipes"	&&&
This thing constantly opens and dries out the wipes.	&&&
"At first I was skeptical but tried them and they are awesome. Cleans the nose and face so much easier and kinder on little noses."	&&&
Very good for sensitive skin! Easy to use and dispense once you get them started.	&&&
justb what the Doctor orderd	&&&
These wipes work well for basic makeup. I like them for taking off my face makeup and eyeshadow. They don't seem to bother my skin at all. It really doesn't take off mascara though. I have only tried it with non-waterproof, and I have to pull at my eyelashes to get it off!	&&&
"I use this product for my 9 month old girls, to clean their face, neck, arms and fingers from all the mess they get into! Also I really like the feeling and scent myself and use them as tissues!"	&&&
The sensitive wipes are great for my daughters sensitive skin.	&&&
"This wipes dispenser is a must have in my book and my husband loves it too. You really only pull one at a time, it is easy to close and open and isn't bad looking. When my husband had to change the baby's diaper at the pediatrician's office, he pulled just about all of the wipes out of the travel case and was confused on why that happened--he didn't realize that the wipes dispenser at home was a special one. This wipes dispenser just makes life a little bit easier, and what new parent doesn't need little bit of that."	&&&
Love love love it!! I love seeing the dirty water and knowing it won't go back on the floor. You have to remember to go slow and give the scrubbers time to scrub. It's loud so I wear earplugs. It does a great job cleaning and drying the floor.	&&&
Got mine fast, i love pampers wipes.	&&&
Keeps the wipes wet and warm however, I think I got a defective product as the lid will not stay closed on its own.	&&&
"In my experience, these are the best bug repellant wipes on the market. While I'd rather find a natural alternative, the risks of some bug bites, for me outweigh my preference for a more eco-friendly product.

I've been on many trips, overseas and across the US, in all kinds of climates, from swamps to rural plains and from seasides to forests. In my travels, I've been bitten and stung more times than I'd care to count. But, when I know Im going somewhere biting bugs are likely, these are the wipes I pack.

These are also great when you need to apply to the kids, and want to avoid all those sprays that sting eyes, and give uneven application. The wipes provide a consistent dispensation of the product on the skin, and without the nuisance of sprays.

If you do have a natural alternative (product or home remedy), please do tell me about it in the comments section."	&&&
We like these wipes, they are thicker and more durable so you don't make such a mess using them, are safe on sweet baby skin, no harsh chemicals, and are also safer for the environment. I recommend them! Just wish they were a little larger so they covered more area.	&&&
This is a very nice facial wipe - love the way my skin feels after using. However, I do have to use 2 wipes to get makeup and dirt completely off.	&&&
Huggies are by far my favorite wipe and I've tried them all! My daughter is almost 3 and I find that Huggies wipes are thicker and I use LESS wipes than other brands to clean up after dirty diapers.	&&&
As other reviewers noted, these were barely moist when the package arrived. Also, the smell is so pungent that it drove both me and the cat crazy. Would not buy again.	&&&
The wipes are so tough it is hard seeing that I will ever be able o use them on a baby as they are intended	&&&
Arrived on time and works well	&&&
Bigger than I thought but so darn cute!	&&&
This is the second one I have owned and I still love the product.	&&&
A significant upgrade over its competition, it's much larger, seems less soapy and acts more medicated. My eyes feel cleaner than after using the other product, and the feeling lasts longer. I'm glad I tried them. Customer service is excellent.	&&&
I've used these since my baby was born. The name brand wipes have unnecessary ingredients and left a film on her skin. These do the job!	&&&
these little wipes smell great with the orange scent. Nice to keep in the truck to clean you face on a hot day.	&&&
"Picked up this product when we were at Babies R Us. We wanted to give our son a teething toy but didn't want to give it to him until we could clean it. Grabbed this product gave it a quick wipe down and felt good about him chewing on the new toy that god knows how many people had touched before we decided to purchase it."	&&&
Bought these again because they come in so handy. Beats having to use a microfiber and spray, i just keep 1 or 2 in my wallet and a few in each car, and a box at home... clean glasses everywhere... and phones, lcd screens, etc.	&&&
"Pro tip: flip package upside down when not in use so the wipes on top are nicely saturated.

Minus one star for the cost. $15 is expensive for two packs, 60 wipes total. Other than the price, I really, really like these wipes. The size of the wipe is standard size and they are not dry nor overly saturated. I really like how when I pull out a wipe, only ONE comes out, not 2 or 3 like I've experienced with other brands. (This is really due to how the wipes are packaged.) The wipes are not drying and actually do moisturize a bit. If you don't mind the $15 price tag, I highly recommend these wipes. I would love to purchase again if I can find a good deal next time.

I received a discount in exchange of an unbiased, honest review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product."	&&&
I use them to clean the oil off my face and seems to work well.	&&&
very handy and gives me peace of mind to these mask wipes to give my mask a quick wipe before putting it on	&&&
"These are very large at 5x8 inches, but note that they dry out very quickly. I discovered these during a hospital stay and a packet was sent home with me. Ever since I have used these when I am handling and preparing certain foods like chicken and seafood. I also keep a few handy in my vehicle for when I am out and about and need to use public restrooms.

The active ingredient is alcohol (65.9% by volume), and the remaining ingredients are water, propylene glycol, glycerin, carbomer, aminomethyl propanol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice and tocopheryl acetate. I am mentioning these in case you have sensitivities or allergies to any of the ingredients,

One of the reasons why I rated this so highly is they are used in my local hospital, which to me is a significant endorsement. Purchasing these in bulk makes them affordable, and the protection they provide makes them well worth it to me."	&&&
I bought this because I have loved every other Oxo Tot product I've bought (and I have most of them). But this one is a dud. For one, it's quite large. Takes up a lot of space in the diaper bag. (and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to hang it off of. The handle of the stroller??) 2: it's not very easy to open. You have to push the button hard and it takes two hands. and 3: worst of all- it has no seal to it and wipes totally dry out. Better off just using a ziploc bag. It's compact and practically free.	&&&
easy to carry with you everywhere you go, I have some in my purse and as well in my car. Great Price!	&&&
Great product	&&&
these are the best wipes out there would not use any other brand. I have and they all stink	&&&
Have owned previous Hoover products. This little machine really cleans hard floor surfaces. Does not scrub tile grout well, even with the Hoover Tile & Grout mix. Yet, gets that surface dirt and does not leave any water marks. Could not believe the dirt that came off hardwood floors. My house cleaner just pushed the dirt around with a mop and rags - she is no longer. We have four dogs, and cleaning up footprints on the tile is so easy. Just having to do some heavy duty on the grout, and something I regularly clean and seal.	&&&
"With our first son our wipe warmer completely dried out the wipes, so we decided not to purchase a wipe warmer with our second. Our newest little arrived on March 8th and after a few tearful diaper changes I sent my husband to buy a wipe warmer. He came home with this and I almost sent him back to return it because I wasn't convinced on the price!

I'm glad I gave this a shot! It keeps the wipes moist and the temperature is perfect for our little newborn! He doesn't cry at the touch of the wipe anymore and diaper changes are a little more comfortable for him. My only complaint is the size of the product, which only fits about 25-30 wipes before needing to be restocked. We all know babies go through wipes like crazy, however I imagine the size helps keep the wipes moist. It also comes with a car charger which is great for warm wipes on the go!"	&&&
simply the best wipes. a great scent, doesnt irritate my son's sensitive skin. they are awesome for changing diapers and cleanup. my kid had some gnarly blowouts when we were using Luvs (we switched to Pampers cruisers yesterday for my chubby dude), and these wipes are up to the task. Will always have them around, even after the baby doesnt need them for diaper changes!	&&&
Love the wipes they are wonderful been using them since my son was born I Recommend them to everybody	&&&
IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE EFFECTIVE	&&&
Great for cleaning glasses and the screens of gadgets when on the run. I always keep a few in my backpack and travel bag.	&&&
I have a 6 year old female bulldog with all those folds her face gets yeast build up especially above the nose fold or more like a pocket than a fold but these wipes keep all her folds so clean & smelling great!! Def will be ordering more!	&&&
Love these wipes I always make sure there in stock at home. Great quality good price.	&&&
These wipes are absolutely amazing! I highly recommend! What is so nice is you aren't too worried that your little one will get diaper rash since it's just water and fruit extract! And they work perfectly and keep moist!	&&&
I truly love these and they work great taking off makeup! I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review	&&&
Great product good price	&&&
I use these convenient wipes at home and they make for a quick cleanup. My daughters also use these in their dorms for daily touchups. Leaving sink area smelling fresh.	&&&
I love this product it makes my face fell so refreshed. Aveeno is a wonderful product. I have never had a bad experience with any Aveeno product. It removes alot of oil and make up that my face feels so refresh.	&&&
"We won't be buying these again. Here's what we dislike:
1. Packaging is refill-only. That is, you can't pop these in a diaper bag or travel with them because there's no resealable opening.

2. They're smaller and feel thinner than some other wipes. We prefer the Kirkland brand.

3. They're smelly. For ""sensitive"" wipes, they have a pretty strong scent.

4. They're kinda slimy. Obviously wipes need to be moist, but these feel slick."	&&&
These gave my son a rash so I had to give them away. They seemed like good quality wipes though.	&&&
Best baby wipes!	&&&
I really am grateful for this product; my baby was having a persistent irritation on her butt-no matter how freaquently I changed her diaper nor how much diaper rash cream I put on her. Started usung this Baby Bits solution and within 24 hrs the irritation significantly reduced. I had planned to use the big company baby wipes while we are out of home- but this past weekend on Sat alone within a few hrs she broke out a rash and by Sunday even more. By Sunday evening I started using the Baby Bits solution and by Monday morning the rash was resolving. So glad I gave this a try. The lavender smell is not too strong for me.	&&&
CLOROX IS THE ONLY BRAND THAT I TRUE IN DIFSINFECTING WIPES.	&&&
I cannot find these in local stores so I bought them online. They are great for cleaning white boards.	&&&
Great product. Fast shipping!	&&&
im always trying to choose the natural option but it isnt always fast and easy. These are natural, fast, and easy! my 3 favorite things	&&&
These are great. I don't like the boogie wipes because of the perfume they have. They are so strong, but these are odorless and very safe to use on my baby's eyes and face.	&&&
safe to use on sensitve baby but	&&&
"I use the wiper every day for my new born and not having a cold wipe on his bottom is just about the best thing next to not having a wipe go there.
The warmer does not get too hot and it keeps plenty of moisture inside the wipes.
You get the most bang for your buck for sure."	&&&
I love these wipes more than any other wipes. I seen other reviews about how wet they are but you can easily squeeze out some of the wetness. But they are perfect for my sons dried on food or dry mucus. They have a very faint scent that smells refreshing but I don't believe and added fragrance is added. The wipe isn't as thick as Huggies Brand but From my experience Huggies dried out faster and weren't wet enough. I use two at a time to clean his number 2s but I still never run out. My subcription is 1box every 3-4 monthsMy son has not broken out from them yet (2years old). When I have my newborn and try the wipes on that baby I will have to update this hopefully. I gave this product 4stars because I wish they were a little thicker but other than that these are amazing if you don't mind doubling up on their number 2s	&&&
"We keep the warmer with all the diaper essentials and use it every day. I love that the wipes not only stay at the perfect temperature, but retain their individual moisture as well and don't dry out. I don't like how you do not have the option of turning the warmer on or off. If it did have that option, I feel it would make the product perfect, and I wouldn't have a complaint about it!"	&&&
Was really happy with this didn't take no time at all to arrive at my house	&&&
After carefully reading the ingredients, I cancelled my subscription. There is no need for this chemical in these wipes, they already have parabens in them. Personal preference, I pass.	&&&
I purchased these because they were slightly cheaper than the Clorox Wipes that I usually purchase. Every time I wiped down my kitchen and bathroom counters, they left behind a streaky residue. I got rid of the Lysol Wipes and am now back to using Clorox Wipes.	&&&
"In my experience, these are the best bug repellant wipes on the market. While I'd rather find a natural alternative, the risks of some bug bites, for me outweigh my preference for a more eco-friendly product.

I've been on many trips, overseas and across the US, in all kinds of climates, from swamps to rural plains and from seasides to forests. In my travels, I've been bitten and stung more times than I'd care to count. But, when I know Im going somewhere biting bugs are likely, these are the wipes I pack.

These are also great when you need to apply to the kids, and want to avoid all those sprays that sting eyes, and give uneven application. The wipes provide a consistent dispensation of the product on the skin, and without the nuisance of sprays.

If you do have a natural alternative (product or home remedy), please do tell me about it in the comments section."	&&&
Have used for the past 2 years	&&&
It's not a gentle make up remover wipes, it stings around the eyes (Not for sensitive skin)and only good for removing non-waterproof mascara. The cloth is not soft as it is just an okay makeup remover. Try the KORRES milk protein wipes which is truly gentle and soft.	&&&
The only wipes we use for our daughter.	&&&
These wipes don't leave any residue behind and clean well. One wipe is enough for 2-3 pairs of glasses at a time, or I use mine on my glasses and then have enough moisture left to wipe my smartphone and/or tablet and notebook screens.	&&&
Cleans board great	&&&
They clean butts pretty good, I dont have a baby but I am sure they work good on them too....because they are smaller.	&&&
"Works great I use this everyday keep s bacteria away!!!!!!?:-)? my mother uses it I use it . Great for pet stains if u have a cat too! We wipe shoes down with one wipe too!!!!!!!!!!!! WELL WORTH THE PRICE USUALLY ON SALE TOO!!!! Lysol wipes are great but Clorox wipe s are for heavier duty jobs toliets kitchen grease window sills garbage can s and so much more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We get multiple containers we even recycle the container s too!!!!!"	&&&
These are awesome! Sensitive to skin, more than just one use for these wipes can use to cleanse your own hands too! Absorbent, not too franc rant, soft, not too wet.	&&&
"Good quality and quantity. My daughters love it!!"	&&&
Works like it should.	&&&
Great product. Kind of wish they were smaller pieces for when my kiddo only had 2 or 4 teeth. But the material tears easily if you want to 1/2 it to make them last longer.	&&&
These wipes are great they are soft and don't feel rough.	&&&
Great for the price.	&&&
"Useful for removing make up."	&&&
"you can not beat their deal at staples for bundles on cleaning supplies I highly recommend buying their cleaning items there, every time I go into their store I am always getting great savings that local competitors can not beat. And for them to have promotions every time I am in there says a lot since I go every other day."	&&&
We have hardwood floors and some laminate...I have tried the swifter products only for them to leave a film, these are wonderful, you need the pole / head piece, but I bought one of those in 2008 and it is still like new, only need to replenish the covers..love this product	&&&
I'm all for saving money on store brands, but not at the cost of giving up quality as is the case in these wipes. You have to scrub harder to make them work and the scent is not as fresh or strong.	&&&
These wipes are a life saver, I use them on my 19 month old, 5 year old and I'm sure I will with baby #3. I use them for my 19 month old stuffy and runny noses and with my 5 year old who has allergies. I even tried them on my husband (sinuses) and he loves them. They work instantly and loosen up mucus. The saline in them is awesome since my little one sometimes give me a hard time with the spray. I take these everywhere!	&&&
My baby has very sensitive skin. Pampers sensitive wipes does not irritate her skin.	&&&
Great wipes. The only brand I'll buy.	&&&
Works good	&&&
These wipes are amazing. I love keeping a container under all of the sinks in my house (ie: bathrooms, kitchen). It is quick and easy to just grab one and wipe down the surfaces and then toss them in the garbage. They disinfect and clean quickly! Love them.	&&&
Fair product. Horrible design flaw with dispensing. Too big really for stowing in a purse or backpack w/o taking up a lot of room, unless you've got a separate diaper bag for it, it's just not a convenient size. Too bad too, as I like the company & their products very much.	&&&
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I loved them. They relieve the pain and itch associated with hemorrhoids! As a mother of many babies I have suffered from these painful issues. These really do help! I recommend them to anyone who has any discomfort associated with hemorrhoids!	&&&
"My pedodontist told me that in a small percentage of cases (perhaps 5%), breastfeeding during the night can cause tooth decay in babies. I was surprised to hear that, because I've read so much about the subject, and most babies with teeth can safely breastfeed at night and not develop decay. However, my pedodontist has seen tooth decay firsthand in the babies of very well-informed parents who did everything 'by the book'. She wanted to make sure that I knew that although the risk is low, my baby could be at risk (and there's no way to know if your child has the kind of teeth that will be at risk - until the damage is done). For this reason, she recommended I stop breastfeeding during sleep hours (when a baby's production of protective saliva is greatly reduced).

I was reluctant to do that, however, because my baby won't drink cow's or goat's milk (and hates formula), and I produce much more milk at night than during the day. Given those circumstances, she recommended this product, and my baby LOVES the taste of both the apple and the grape. **BEFORE** I breastfeed her in the wee hours, I wipe out her mouth thoroughly with a Spiffie. The package doesn't say anything about this particular usage of the product, but I trust my pedodontist, who explained that by coating the teeth with zylitol (a wood sugar), you give the mouth's bacteria something to eat rather than the natural sugar in breastmilk. Somehow (the details of it escape me), this prevents the bacteria from attacking the baby's teeth. It's still not as safe as brushing the teeth, then not breastfeeding until daylight hours, but it helps mitigate the risk of decay.

The only downside is that my baby chomps on my finger -hard!- sometimes. It helps if I use a finger on my other hand to prop her mouth open. Another bonus is that the Spiffies really do seem to placate her if she's teething. She'll really chomp down, suck hard on the Spiffie, and then relax and sleep better after being 'Spiffied'. Just be careful that you have a good hold on the Spiffie; my baby loves it so much she sucks really hard, and might swallow it if I'm not careful."	&&&
I really liked the fact that when I opened them, they didn't remind me of an outhouse. but after I purchased them, then they made the headlines about having ingredients in them that weren't suppose to be there, and being made in China. I don't think I would purchase them again.	&&&
This is a multi use product that I always like to have on hand because you never know when there will be a mess or something to be cleaned. They work great and can be used for so many different things. And it makes cleaning so easy. "	&&&
Thick and fragrance free! I am able to get all our BIG messes cleaned up quick without worries about what I am using on my daughter's sensitive skin.	&&&
This product is a lot cheaper in the stores..I was not pleased at all with the price. I thought the ad was deceptive.	&&&
So I bought this product expecting for it to be amazing and well it's far from that. First of all, it's very hard to use and is not effective at all, it took me at least 5 minutes for me to wipe off my makeup. Also it is way to expensive, [$] for a package of facial wipes that don't even work?! Also it says it's for sensitive skin, but the wipe is too thick and it drys out my skin AND it leaves a sticky residue on my face. Bottom line- I will not rec ommend this to a friend HA even an enemy for that matter!	&&&
I love how convenient they are. Disinfects and smells good. They are a little pricey but I try to purchase on sale and with a coupon. Great product overall. "	&&&
My favorite wipes because they clean the board like new!	&&&
This stuff is absolutely wonderful! Being a Gold Eagle made product, I expected it to be good....but 303® Aerospace Protectant wipes exceeded my expectations. It's fantastic. It is so easy to use, cleans surfaces as it puts down a layer of super high quality protectant, and has unbelievable lasting power! It's been two weeks since I wiped down my interior, I haven't cut it any slack, and it STILL looks awesome! I'm a true believer now. I threw away the other brands of protectant wipes I had on hand....303® is the bomb!!	&&&
Nice and thick! Wet enough for even toddlers bottoms! LOVE them!!!	&&&
I really liked these. I actually like the cucumber scent. Not to strong. Does not dry out my baby's skin. We go through a ton of diaper wipes so this was a great value for us. They are also super thick which is important when things get very messy. I think we will keep purchasing!	&&&
Kind of pricey but a nice luxury to clean my baby's nose.	&&&
I bought these for my son and husband after seeing on Shark Tank. I should have listened to Barbara; they are very thin and break easily. Will stick with baby wipes going forward.	&&&
Love using these wipes they are easy to use and throw away.	&&&
These are great wipes. They dispense very nicely, even better than some of the other brand name wipes. They do not rip easily, like some I have encountered. I have 2 grand-babies in diapers so we go through a lot of wipes.	&&&
This product definitely gets the job done. I love something that can help me clean in a swift manner for my busy lifestyle that doesn't reduce the quality of my cleaning. I'm able to use it on most of my furniture and technology equipment. Very satisfied with these wipes.	&&&
They make him smell good	&&&
These are nice and gentle for the sensitive gal. They get up all the make up but do not irritate skin that suffers from rosacea.	&&&
Pampers sensitive wipes are an excellent companion to their Sensitive diapers or alone.	&&&
I bought these for my boyfriend and I think he was embarrassed. But oh well. He used them and he likes them! Likes the smell and the size. They're individually packaged which is great. He will be bringing these in his gym bag!	&&&
It made my dog break out in hives :(. I had to go back to my regular Petco brand.	&&&
I love these wipes. We got them as part of a gift basket with our first and I fell in love with them. They work amazingly for baby and even work extremely well in a clean up pinch in other areas of my home (what mom hasn't been there? lol) I love that they're natural and easy on baby's skin. The only complaint I have, and its a very very minuscule one, is that even the unscented ones seem to have a strange smell when I'm pregnant. But that might just be my sup er sensitive pregnancy nose! All in all, I highly recommend to any mom, dad, or caregiver!	&&&
The pen was better but still good	&&&
I'm very happy with these flight wipes. I've been carrying them with me everywhere I go and I really like that they are anti-bacterial. The are thicker and better quality than a lot of the wipes on the market, and smell better too! They are perfect to carry in my purse, or in the diaper bag. They leave my hands feeling moisturized too. Most antibacterial wipes don't do this. The small travel packs are easy to carry. I've even put them in the kids' backpacks, and it's great to have these wipes handy whenever I need them. I'm very happy to have received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.	&&&
This is the only wipes I've used since my baby was born. I absolutely love it! It's heavy duty, does not break up easily. I even use it to wipe my child's hands and face. Would definitely recommend Huggies wipes!	&&&
i love clorox wipes they are so convenient to use for quick messes i leave a container in the kitchen and in the bathrooms for quick messes.	&&&
"I have to have these.
Great for sanitizing door knobs and the handle on the toilet.
Never will I ever run out of these.
They are a must at my home."	&&&
Got a great deal! Great product!	&&&
A must have for cleaning your scanner bed!	&&&
These are great. I'm still on number one and have the rest of the bag to use this summer. I am going to buy another bag.	&&&
Great for hardwood surfaces. Eliminates getting on floor and scrubing floor.	&&&
I bought it as a travel supplement.	&&&
I loved these wipes from the first time I tried them. Something has changed; not sure what happened but I wish someone would take notice of the complaints similar to mine and do something about it.	&&&
Thank you!	&&&
These are awesome, removes waterproof make up and is good on sensitive skin.	&&&
I love clorox products! I feel more secure when I am using clorox over surfaces. Also shirts are cleaner when I use clorox.	&&&
They only give you one container for your Huggies and you are left with a bag that is sealable but with the potential they'll all dry out.	&&&
Are you a germ-a-phob? I'm a lil bit. Especially when flying. There are so many ppl on a plane with only a few bathrooms. These lil wipes come in handy. You get 6 15ct packs. The way I see that is one pack per person per trip. They are TSA approved. Non alcohol antibacterial wipes. Perfect for grabbing door handles, wiping toliet seats and even those nasty trays. I mean in today's germ filled world, and tight spaces you can never be too careful. Especially when traveling internationally. These are a must have in everyone's carry on. I'm so glad I was able to catch these on a promotional sale. You can't carry sanitizer these are the next best thing. Especially if your like me with a messy infant you'll really need these. To clean up messes, clean up faces and dirty lil hands.	&&&
I honestly love it.	&&&
"small package but great for price can't bet it"	&&&
Awesome possum	&&&
Great price	&&&
They remove makeup, but when I wipe my face my eyeliner/mascara comes right off of the wipe and back on to my face. The wipes also irritated my eyes and my skin. I don't have the most sensitive skin either. I will never be buying these wipes again.	&&&
"Have been using this for about a week. It's great for cloth wipes, we use both the Lionheart warmies and Grovia wipes, both fit nicely. It can fit about 18 wipes comfortably. Our baby hates cold wipes, with this warmer, he's made no fuss with diaper changes. We always used to heat the wipes under running warm water, which was a waste of water, so this warmer works well for us.
We aren't using the provided pad at the bottom, as we keep rotating the wipes with freshly washed damp wipes as we go through them with diaper changes. We plan on wiping it down once a week or so to make sure no mold grows, but haven't seen any yet.
There is a light in the front which is quite bright, so we had to cover it when baby was in our room, but it might be fine for when baby is in his own room as it adds a soft ""night light"".
Definitely a good purchase."	&&&
A large number of these were none dry when I took them on a trip to the UK!	&&&
"This is a useful product. I wear glasses but find that they end up in pockets or perched on my forehead. Smearing, finger prints, and general use gradually adds a layer of impurities on the lenses...usually so gradually, you don't notice until it's pretty bad. These wipes are perfect. Why?

Individually wrapped means I can take a handful and keep them in my suit coat pocket. Ready to go when I need them. This also means that every time I use one of these wipes, I know that it is clean and sanitary.

The solution works and is just enough to clean a thoroughly dirty lens. I purposely smeared my glasses and tried one of these wipes - did yeoman work. The wipe is large enough to do the job, has enough solution to handle a tough job but not so much that it is dripping, and is strong enough to clean the lens."	&&&
Lent free, and soft and great for lens...... I would buy again....	&&&
I have been using Neutrogena make-up removing wipes and love them! I also love the Neutrogena Grapefruit acne fighting body wash. So I thought I would love these wipes. They are HORRIBLE!! They sting your face and imediately made me feel like I had a rash. When I woke up in the morning my skin looked red and puffy. Basically it makes your skin worse. I am just going to stick with the make-up removing wipes they are awesome. DO not buy this one.	&&&
"Brought it on sale. Good value. Cleans and smells good."	&&&
Use them on my eyeglasses. Seem to work fine.	&&&
These are great. I don't like the boogie wipes because of the perfume they have. They are so strong, but these are odorless and very safe to use on my baby's eyes and face.	&&&
I'm finding several of the individual packets are completely dry when I open them. Very disappointing	&&&
Best thing for hardwood/tile floors. It even dries the floor as well. For houses that have nothing but hardwood /tile I would get an extension cord to prevent moving outlet to outlet if that bugs you.	&&&
Huggies wipes are by far the absolute best wipe on the market. I would never buy any other brand.	&&&
It is so soft and feel comfortable to use for child. We use this during meal time for our child. But I feel it is small to use as bath towel.... I like this softness..	&&&
These wipes work great, smell wonderful, and beat all other brands I've ever used. Highly recommend!!	&&&
"Started using this product. This is much better than Kleenex it doesn't leave their noses all red. And it has a great smell"	&&&
Got these not for a baby but for face cloths for myself. They are indeed super soft and seem to wash well.	&&&
I love these wipes. I have been using it since the birth of my son on March 17, 2015 and I am still using it currently. We love it and we recommend that you get it for your child(ren). This is a perfect gift for baby shower.	&&&
"I keep this product on my daughter's changing table and use the wipes each morning after she wakes to wipe her face. Also use throughout the day to wipe her runny nose or milk mustache. The wipes smell fresh and don't leave a residue on her face or my hands. Would definitely buy these again in the future. Very handy!"	&&&
I love these. I like that they are a little on the wet side...they make cleaning "bigger" messes easy. They are super soft and they don't irritate baby's skin. and for the amount of wipes you get, this is a GREAT price!	&&&
These wipes are pretty decent for the price. I've been using these to keep my baby clean all the time. These are a little thin but I dont think its a big deal. I generally buy these when these are on sale and for close to 1 cent per wipe you cant ask for more :)	&&&
I like the feel of these wipes. I've used them for both of my children after having tried a variety of types I've landed on and stuck with these.	&&&
Best wipes on the market and a generic does not exist that even remotely compares. Thick and clean well and keep their wetness.	&&&
"These wipes are gentle and soothing. They are just the right thing a woman needs. Love the scent too, it's fresh and girly.

I received a Free sample of this from Smiley360.com"	&&&
These are a great idea. They have lots of these things for women, but this is the first I've seen for men and I believe men would need something like this more than women.	&&&
I only gave it a 3 star because they sent me the wrong one..But this is not a good one if your trying to buy it for a makeup remover..But when I wipe my face it doesn't feel dry and I also know that I'm getting benefits like vitamins and nutrients -hope that helped	&&&
Whether you're cleaning up the kitchen after dinner or need to do a quick clean of the bathroom because your mother-in-law just texted that she's stopping by....Clorox wipes are where it's at. I love that the clean well without leaving a harsh smell. They are gentle enough to use on my bathroom fixtures and granite countertops. I like knowing the germs are GONE! Especially during cold and flu season. With an almost 2 year old daughter, it's important that I know everything is sanitary. These affordable wipes last a long time too	&&&
I like the price and thickness of theses diaper wipes. I hate that they don't come apart easily and that little pieces seem to break off when you pull on them. Pampers Sensitive wipes are the best out there, but these are a decent substitute.	&&&
Just like every baby my newborn hates cold wipes, especially at night. We love this product, & it warms them perfectly. Only thing i dislike about it, us that it has to be plugged in at all times, wish thet were battery operated. Otherwise this works wonderfully!	&&&
This removes some make-up but not all of it. Leaves residue behind.	&&&
Very reliable wipes. I even use them for my safety glasses."}},	&&&
"I was hovering between 3 and 4 stars... I would give them 4 stars for their intended purpose - pacifier/toy wipes. However, I really bought them in an effort to save money compared to the Medela pump part wipes I have been using, and for that purpose I'd only give them 3 stars. They are much smaller than the Medela wipes, and far less moist. So they don't do as good a job wiping the parts between uses. Also, because they are so small, it's difficult to wipe the inside of the pump bottle - the Medela wipes are large so they can reach the bottom of the bottle. These Munchkin wipes really require at least 2 wipes to do the same job as 1 (or even half of one) of the Medela wipes.

For wiping off pacifiers and toys that fell to the ground, I think they are the perfect size, and a good value for 36 wipes. I just don't use them for that purpose."	&&&
When you pull them out of the container, these things shred much too easily. You lose so many wipes. Not worth it.	&&&
As always these wipes never fail to achieve all I set out to use them for, from the typical diaper change wiping, to cleaning hands and faces. These things get the job done, and don't leave my son smelling like he just took a chemical bath.	&&&
great for wiping up after children, pets, or messy adults. Keeps the house germ free!!!	&&&
Love this thing. A few complaints but the good outweighs the bad. The good, is the obvious doesn't allow dirty to mix with clean water. Love it. The bad? It's heavy. Imagine doing 1500sq ft of porcelain tile. I was starting to develop a callus in the palm of my hand. Then (like my other Hoover products) the wear and tear on the inside parts start to take effect. It stopped dispensing the clean solution. So what i do now is while it's powered off I throw some clean solution on the floor, scrub it with the spin scrub then power it on to suck up the water. It doesn't kill my hand (it's easier to maneuver when it's off) and it does its job.	&&&
I was looking around in the store trying to find anything else I would need to get for my daughters new tablet. An associate was helping me and we came across this and I am super glad we got it.	&&&
I love these! I got them for myself, but they ended up being fantastic for my preteen son! Easy for him to use and working great on his face. Buy these!	&&&
I love these wipes! They are soft and a good size for clean ups without being hard to handle. I sometimes have to use two on really messy diapers (the same as disposable wipes). I have been using them for 6 months. I wash them 3-4 times a week. I have had NO PROBLEM with the seem unraveling, NO pilling, NO bunching (there is only one layer). They are perfect! I tried the geffin baby hemp jersey wipes, but they have a rough texture that my baby doesn't like. These need about 10 washings before they are FULLY preped and absorb water right away. You don't have to wait that long to start using them, but that's how many washes for full absorbency. 2 packs has been enough for me so far. These are a great value. I may buy more for baby wash cloths and for cleaning my face since they are so soft and durable.	&&&
It has helped me to reduce the swallowing of my hemorrhoid. Bleeding has been minimal since I started using it.	&&&
These are spectacular and handy wipes. I will get them again.	&&&
no phony gaggy perfume or 'antibacterial' crap. Just good useful wipes for EVERYONE to use. I have them in every room, car, saddlebag..........try and find them in the stores. I couldn't, just all that anti bacterial garbage.	&&&
Sam's Club price was less then 1/2 of what medical supply stores wanted for same identical product!	&&&
These are great! Nice quality! They are made like the nicer (or more expensive) ones I've used before. I use these in the car, to pick up after my puppies, and have them in 2-3 rooms of my house. The Fresh Scent is light and smells kind of like apples, to me. These are good to have around even if you don't have a baby!	&&&
Keep these in the car and they are a life saver	&&&
I love these wipes! They're soft, but they hold together even though the most traumatic of diaper changes. They texture really gets my baby clean, even a spaghetti face. The price is great, especially with free delivery.	&&&
"These things are so cool. Fascinated with their concept, I ordered EZ Towel and Wysi Wipe to compare brands for our extended backpacking trips. Here’s what I found:

At first when I wet them and laid them out, I thought they were identical to each other, but they are different. They seem to be made of the same gauzy-like material, but EZ Towels are somewhat thicker and sturdier. I love that the EZ Towels come with a storage tube that holds ten of their wipes. The full tube weighed in at 1.3 oz. I then refilled it with ten of the Wysi Wipes, which weighed 1.1 oz. But because the Wysi Wipes are slightly less bulky, I was then able to add three more to the tube to give a total of thirteen wipes instead of ten.

Pricing: at the time of our purchase, the EZ Towels were $8.15 for a 50 count. That put them at 16.3 cents each. The Wysi Wipes were $12.97, or 12.9 cents each. Perhaps they are the same price per oz. But! I just saw that Wysi Wipes also has a bag of 500! So, of course I had to calculate that too. Cost is $45.66, kind of hefty, but now the wipes would only be 9.1 cents. Good to know.

I can see the benefit to using both brands. I may even put a combination of them into the tube for different uses. The thicker ones will make good dish cloths, for one thing. Our family will use them on a trip in a couple of weeks to put them to the test. I’m not sure you should put these down a privy even though they say biodegradable. I will be ordering two more bags of the EZ Towels just so we can get two more tubes, one for each of us for our packs. Then we’ll also have a nice supply of these wipes."	&&&
"Easy to pack and carry everywhere we go. These work effectively. They are good at wiping little hands and faces too!"	&&&
Not only are these a required piece to every baby bag, they are great to have in general for wiping up sticky spills or hands, removing make up smudges and to cool you off on really hot days. So no matter what age you are, pick up a pack and keep some on your person at all times. I've found them to be quite handy.	&&&
"I have had this almost a year, and they have done some updates to the unit. However I have had no issues with this model, Used last night as well for more then 30min.
I wish the scrubbers came out a hair more. but I just leave on the 'wash' position, it dries fast, no need to switch to the 'dry'"	&&&
Really great wipes, wish they were a little thicker. They are very soft and durable	&&&
Great for a back up plan when the wipes dry out or all the burp cloths are in the wash	&&&
Best wipes, hands down.	&&&
I love these wipes, very durable! They don't tear like other wipes I've used. Good price for good quality! I recommend these wipes to everyone!	&&&
These wipes are thin and soft, but they are not as effective at cleaning as the one and done wipes. I won't be buying these again.	&&&
the best and most pure thing on the market. don't use anything else on your babies sensitive skin!	&&&
We've always been conflicted about all the stainless steel appliances we have in our home. (Refrigerator, Microwave, Dishwasher, Over, Vent hood) They look great, but keeping them clean can be a challenge. A neighbor recommended we try Enduroshield after they saw a commercial for it on TV and tried it themselves. So we tried it out. Much to our surprise the first thing we noticed was how "new" it made the stainless steel look and without leaving streaks like all the other products do. In addition, we noticed that it does not leave an oily film on the surface, like another product we tried. Needless to say we are thrilled with the results so far and highly recommend it!	&&&
Love it. I bought it as a gift for my sister's daughter.	&&&
clorox wipes are my favorite wipes. I use these wipes for everything. I have to have my clorox wipes where ever I go."	&&&
I love the Honest Company, I'm just not a big fan of these travel size wipes. The 10 wipes wouldn't last me a days outing if my daughter pooped more than once. I prefer to take the regular size container with me. The wipes themselves are very durable and soft.	&&&
While I've had hemorrhoids for a long time, they got worse after I had my son. I was relieved when Smiley 360 asked me to try these for free because I had spent so much money on other products that just didn't work. I was still quite skeptical though. Anyhow, I was having a flair you, which happens more and more frequently, and decided to try these. They worked amazing, got rid of the pain and itch and made me feel like a woman again. I highly recommend these to any woman whether you've had children or not.	&&&
Love! I really like these wipes, and have found that other brands are either too dry or too "soapy." These hold up well, and have a very mild, clean and fresh scent. I love purchasing wipes in bulk and having them delivered right to my door - much cheaper and convenient. Also, this box includes a combination of wipes packs - simple refill packs, to-go packs with plastic lids etc. Love!	&&&
"Has a nice scent. Like they are for sensitive skin. They are also lighter than other wipes, which is probably good for the plumbing system..."	&&&
I am a huge fan of these wipes! I thought buying them in bulk they would dry up, but they are very moist and did the job perfectly!	&&&
Was happy to find these. They work great	&&&
Love this product! If you like clean bottoms, buy this.	&&&
Love these wipes. They absolutely get the job done. They are great as well as cleaning up those whiteheads on my face. Ok if I use them too often on my face I will get a irritation on the right side of my face only con for me. My daughter loves these but the only con for her skin they will irritate her bottom. Doesn't irritate any other part of our skin.	&&&
My Fresh Scent Wet Wipes have just enough clean smell and moisture to not overwhelm the senses. they're e-z-2 use, dispense one-at-a-time [like they're supposed to] and don't tear and rip apart before exiting the container. LIKE!"}},	&&&
An improvement over the old model. This seems to pick up the water better and does not drip when you stop.	&&&
Good to clean stainless"}},	&&&
I got these to use mainly in the garage and after trimming some trees I had transferred tree sap to several surfaces including my steering wheel. Got the wipes out and it took care of the mess with relative ease. Finished cleaning the ordinary garage grime from the workbench as well. So far so good, definitely recommend.	&&&
Yes this is total of 600 wipes. 6 packs of 100 that has 2 packs in each of those that holds 50 each. I was crossing my fingers I understood the decription right that it would be a total of 600 and was so glad i read it right. I think the price is fair for all those wipes. Been using these wipes for over a year for my daughter and have had no problems.	&&&
I use these wipes everyday on everything possible. I have a toddler who likes to taste everything and it gives me peace of mind that all surfaces are disinfected. I also live in an apartment complex and we all know creepy bug like to come out at night so after dinner I make sure to wipe all counters and tables and it keeps tem at bay.	&&&
works as expected	&&&
So glad a friend told me about Boogie Wipes! I wasn't sure how helpful they would be until the little one had their first cold. These were great at getting the crust out of the inside of the nose and at grabbing the goo that we sucked out with the nose frida (a wonderful product pairing). Grape is by far the preferred scent for our little one.	&&&
Not what I expected, it doesn't carry much wipes in it, one use and they are all gone. I don't recommend it.	&&&
Work great - good for little noses	&&&
better than the spray for both convenience and finish. the spray leaves a discoloration residue the wipes do not, just crust clean stainless.	&&&
Inside this package are 3 individual refill packs. Each one has the reclosable sticky flap. The wipes are great. They are soft and have just the right amount of wetness. I use them for myself. However, the problem is that each of the refill packs was open at one end or the other. I don't have the case for them to fit into, so I put them into gallon storage bags to keep them moist. They still work and are great, but Pure'n Gentle could be a little more careful with sealing the packaging. Not everyone wants to put them in a hard case.	&&&
So great for stainless steel and granite counter tops. Love it!!!!	&&&
I have enjoyed using my terry cloth mop covers. They don't fit my mop head snugly, but I can still use them none the less. I will purchase them again. I was happy to find them because I could not find them in any of the local stores.	&&&
Definetly worth the price. I had a full face of makeup on and it came off so easily. I had waterproof eyeliner and it came off in like a second. It felt really nice on my skin and I loved the dual-sideness. One side has bumps and the other side does not. It feels nice getting to rub the bumpy side on my skin. It doesn't have a smell and works so well.	&&&
Good stuff. Tried and true.	&&&
great wipes to carry in brief case or purse.	&&&
"Starting using these wipes because that is what our hospital had when baby was born. Safe to say these are the best wipes yet. Baby hasn't had one day of diaper rash yet and he will be 3 months in a few days. I wouldn't use any other wipe.

Also we have a diaper warmer so not having a plastic seal to close the wipes isn't an issue. I do purchase the smaller packs from Target for less than two bucks that do have the plastic resealable closure for my diaper bag."	&&&
"Used them on my son when he had a runny nose. He wasn't too opposed to these as he is to tissues. Also seemed to make his boogers less dry. I would buy this again."	&&&
Where has this product been all my life? Rather, all my baby's life? No more digging your hand into a small hole of a plastic tub or opening the lid only to pull out 5 wipes when you just need 1. No more noisy plastic packaging. No more dried out wipes. It is the one product I will recommend to future parents! We use it with Huggies wipes and it works amazingly well.	&&&
I got a jumbo box of these at my baby shower and I opened up a pack when I was home and I loved the smell I couldn't wait to use them! They smell so clean and like babies! I love how soft they are. I just bought a new pack finally since I finished the one I got from my baby shower I will continue buying these	&&&
Can't live without these! Love them	&&&
"These work when a shower isn't an option. They can help you feel a bit more refreshed no matter the circumstance. These ship to APO/FPO military addresses and easily portable for the soldier in the field.

I last purchased these here on Amazon in February of 2105 and paid $8.51 for the 10 wipe pack. As of March of the same year the price has decreased to $7.51 for the same item. Shipping was free with Amazon Prime."	&&&
I use these for hands on the changing table. Also to wipe things down without harsh chemicals on surfaces where my Baby might end up. I really like them a lot. The only thing I would change is the dispensing. They are really tough to get out of the canister with one hand.	&&&
These Bamboo Washcloths are not only very gentle for babies, but for anyone who has sensitive skin. My daughter has always had skin issues since childhood, and we were searching for Washcloths that are very gentle. These cloths serve the purpose, and no reactions noted. They are so gentle, we decided to stock up on them, for both of us. Soft, gentle, extremely useful & good price. Highly recommended!	&&&
These pads are a lifesaver!!! No more screaming when I change my sons infusion site, every three days!!!	&&&
Smells so bad! Can't even use them. Returned them for a refund. Yuck!	&&&
Can you use this one for disposable wipes?	&&&
These clean great and the Shea butter ones smell awsome.	&&&
These wipes are a good size. There are a good number in the container, too. Unfortunately, they are already drying out, and I haven't had them that long. They probably need a little extra liquid in the container. Otherwise, I'm happy. The thymol smell takes some time to get used to, but I don't mind it at all.	&&&
I'm an OCD about keeping my house top notch clean! Absolutely loved it, my floors were shining. I vacuum and mop every week, was shocked how much dirt came up! Definitely recommend. Attached pics for better understanding what I mean by saying clean-clean :)	&&&
"These are easy to use, inexpensive, and very handy. Usually, I'll just clean off the pacifier in my own mouth, but sometimes it's good to have a wipe to do it instead. This does the job well!"	&&&
"So glad a friend told me about Boogie Wipes! I wasn't sure how helpful they would be until the little one had their first cold. These were great at getting the crust out of the inside of the nose and at grabbing the goo that we sucked out with the nose frida (a wonderful product pairing). Grape is by far the preferred scent for our little one."	&&&
These smell amazing. I use this when I want to feel refreshed or if I'm on my period. Super convenient and this product is inexpensive. Truly amazing and it's a life saver!	&&&
"Wasn't too sure about these, because I usually use the lavender scented ones. I couldn't find those and I hate the citrus, so I thought why not. These work great. My brother does a real number on my kitchen when he visits and tries to cook, so what better time than now to try something now. One wipe cleaned two long counters without a problem! I'm impressed.
The smell is a little potent, so don't do what I did and stick your nose right up to the bottle."	&&&
Love these baby wipes won't by any other brand. Good quality at a great price.	&&&
Your new rippled wipes are terrible. They are thin and shred/tear every time it is pulled from the dispenser. Please go back to the original, thicker, stronger, and better wipes. When you have an out standing product, leave it be, don't try to fix perfection.	&&&
These are just as good as Pampers and Up&Up (Target brand). These are now our baby wipe of choice and added to our subscribe and save.	&&&
I am not impressed at all with these wipes. They tear so easy. Every time I wipe a dirty bum, it tears and my bare fingers end up doing all the wiping. It's basically like wet tissue paper when it comes to doing the deed. I was really excited to try these wipes for the price and wanted to give Huggies a try, but I am just not impressed. If these wipe were thicker, didn't tear so easy, and separated easier from the container (instead of 5 wipes coming out at once and trying to tear them apart with one hand while your other hand is containing your wiggly child), I would love you. You're not user friendly one bit. Back to my awesome thick, plushy, never tears, one wipe comes out at a time, and my child has the shiniest and cleanest bum ever, Pampers wipes. Sorry, Huggies.	&&&
These wipes are the best thing for anyone who suffers from skin allergies and strange rashes to just about anything. They have been getting hard to find in our local stores.	&&&
These wipes seemed alright at first, but when I used one to wipe up some spit up off my little girl's chest and neck she got a rash from it. There's something harsh in these wipes giving my girl contact dermatitis.	&&&
Still using the first box we bought 7 months ago. Helps clean messes well. We use them with cloth wipes.	&&&
Ok, but half of these were dried out. Order another brand.	&&&
This is my wipe of choice for my little one. I have no complaints and use this kind at every diaper change.	&&&
These extra large facial cleansing wipes get rid of all the dirt, makeup, and daily grime as promised. It leaves my normal-to-combination skin feeling fresh and not too tight.	&&&
love this product have it in every room of my house	&&&
This is a perfect match for all statinless steel appliances.	&&&
Love it because they were a gift for my dad and he swears by these. : )	&&&
I use these wipes for the convenience, they are helpful when I am cleaning up dinner and I am wiping down my counter tops and table. When I am in between bathroom cleanings. I use theses to wipe down my bath tub and bathroom sink, to maintain cleaning and disinfecting.	&&&
These wipes are great for on the go or just being kept in all the rooms in the house, in the office, car, purse, etc. Will purchase again.	&&&
The packaging on these wipes is horrible, but overall i like how mild they are. Our 3 week old is developing a very mild rash on her bum, but I dont think its a reflection on these wipes.	&&&
Fast delivery and the product was delivered at my front door. My son is still on the first box (I ordered two). We chose the free fragrance only because my son has sensitive skin. i like the quality and the thickness of the wipes. Will order again.	&&&
They work fine, have used the same brand before.	&&&
This a good product. It does make you feel better	&&&
"We love these wipes! We have tried several brands of natural wipes, and none of them come close to Earth's Best, IMO.
They are super soft and sudsy, which makes cleaning a breeze (compared to some other brands which are thick and rigid, tear easily, or come out feeling too dry). I know some other reviews did not care for the wetness factor but to me that helps get baby's bottom clean the first time. No scrubbing necessary. By the time I dump the wipe in trash and get a new diaper (or now, panties) ready to put on, her bottom is dry.
I also love that these have absolutely no added fragrance, which is perfect since she and I both have very sensitive skin. This brand gets a low-hazard rating from the Environmental Working Group, too, which is a huge plus in my book. We use them for everything - bottoms, hands, face, tabletops at restaurants, toys, etc.
The price really can't be beat, either, when compared to other brands of ""natural"" wipes. I think we paid $0.04/wipe after getting the large 864-count pack through subscribe & save (the cheapest I've seen anywhere). I'm honestly not sure how that compares to other name brand, conventional wipe brands, but we've used a few of those and they didn't come close to these wipes in terms of effectiveness, durability and feel."	&&&
This worked wonderfully for my baby in the first few months then I didn't really need it any longer.	&&&
so convenient to get these by mail. We love these wipes.	&&&
great wipes! no irritation and effective for cleaning up baby with only one wipe. we started with fancy bamboo ones and found that at least 1.5 wipes were required.	&&&
"This is a useful product. I wear glasses but find that they end up in pockets or perched on my forehead. Smearing, finger prints, and general use gradually adds a layer of impurities on the lenses...usually so gradually, you don't notice until it's pretty bad. These wipes are perfect. Why?

Individually wrapped means I can take a handful and keep them in my suit coat pocket. Ready to go when I need them. This also means that every time I use one of these wipes, I know that it is clean and sanitary.

The solution works and is just enough to clean a thoroughly dirty lens. I purposely smeared my glasses and tried one of these wipes - did yeoman work. The wipe is large enough to do the job, has enough solution to handle a tough job but not so much that it is dripping, and is strong enough to clean the lens."	&&&
Worked perfectly. Just a few swipes and the adhesive was gone!	&&&
These work great. Removed all my makeup after a long night at prom!	&&&
I love these things. Great for the whole house. Even cleaned up the engine compartment in my vehicle with these the other day.	&&&
With 3 little boys we are the reason these things are invented! Convenient easy to use, great product! One thing we always keep in stock in our house. Especially during cold/flu season!	&&&
I love how gentle it is; but is too thin hate to use more than 2 wipes.	&&&
Great baby wipes, not to thin and they clean well.	&&&
I am very pleased with this product. It really works to remove dirt, make-up, etc., without drying out my skin, and after I have used this in combination with my cleanser, my skin feels great: soft, clean, ready for the regimen of toner, serum, moisturizer. I highly recommend Precleanse wipes. I also use them often after dance class to remove the build-up from one and a half hours of exuberant exercise. Great!	&&&
"This product is amazing and is the only thing my toddler will allow me to wipe her face with. I would not suggest buying the separate case for the wipes. It is quite bulky. these packages have a seal that is re sealable as long as it's not dirty. Save the bucks and get this pack for the value."	&&&
This was very disappointing because we've used these wipes in the past but this batch has a very odd odor to them. I'm debating returning them.	&&&
Absolutely obsessed. My 8 month old still has a runny eye that may need to be fixed at a year - so not only do we use them for the eye but also the nose during the winter months and to clean the sticky mouth and hands after eating. Does not irritate the skin since baby wipes are not recommended for use except for the bottom. I love the large canisters for home. Easy to dispense rather than the pouches.	&&&
"""These wipes are nice and thick and great to clean hands with. I will definitely be buying them again and again. I Love being able to carry them in my purse and I Love the fact that they are so convenient to use. I also like that they are individually packaged. I really don't have any negatives.

Sani-wipes are the way to go!"""	&&&
"Fabulous for an C-Store/Restaurant or Home. Place in strategic areas and your employees will automatically gtab and clean areas. Large size, cleans extremely well. Well worth the price!"	&&&
Thank you. The package arrived as promised and works well.	&&&
"Great to use in our community fitness room"	&&&
Love these. I keep the box at home, and grab one on the way out to work or whatever. Nice product, well packaged and very useful for a glasses wearer. I also use them to clean my watch face, phone screen, tablet screen and also the screen on my laptop.	&&&
great wipes, a little hard to pull just one out of the package, but very gentle and no harsh smell.	&&&
For the shower we received a ton of different brand wipes and this is the wipe I liked best especially for my LO's sensitive skin.	&&&
Special wipes for your nose sound like a scam but it's not. Prevents raw noses! And smells great.	&&&
"These wipes are great for keeping you clean. However, I do prefer the Cottonelle wipes. Not only are they cheaper, but with Dude wipes you need to finish off with more toilet paper or you will feel a slight burning sensation. The Cottonelle wipes do not burn and the packaging is also better.

On occasion, the Dude wipes will rip or not come out of the package cleanly. I would recommend to the Dude wipes makers, please make the packaging slightly better."	&&&
The sensitive pampers wipes are the way to go in terms of baby wipes! They are the softest compared to other brands.	&&&
Bought these for a friends baby shower. Got them half off!! Would definitely buy these again at that price!	&&&
I've started using on every surface I can find. Doesn't burn if it gets in your skin. I admittedly use Lysol for some things but now prefer Clorox wipes over the Lysol wipes for several reasons. Costs & efficacy being two of them.	&&&
"Eh...
I tried to give these wipes a second chance. They were referred to me buy a friend, and I wasn't impressed the first time. They were cheaper than my usual wipes, so, thinking maybe I just had a bad batch previously, I bought them again. Woof!

These wipes are much drier than your typical makeup wipe which makes rubbing them against your face a bit abrasive. Sure, no one likes a soggy face, but considering that you're supposed to wash after using a wipe, it's never bothered me."	&&&
You really can dust a whole room with one wipe. I've been using these for a few months now and really like them. Simple solution to a never ending chore.	&&&
I took these to a fitness conference where I had early morning workouts. These were very helpful!	&&&
I'd used 303 Aerospace Protectant before to protect black plastic from fading. Results were great (and much better than other products I'd tried) but I had a problem: controlling overspray and making sure I covered areas I wanted to protect evenly without mess. Those problems are solved. The wipes are saturated with enough protectant to provide great coverage and don't dry out so fast there isn't time to finish the job. The wipes are easily folded to hit all the crevices and are easy to control. I'm sold!	&&&
These are the only wipes I can use on my son without him turning beet red or breaking out in a rash!	&&&
I received this as a free product to try and review. I absolutely love these wipes. My daughter has really sensitive skin and they did not make her break out whatsoever. I highly recommend these wipes to everyone.	&&&
These wipes are good to remove makeup and other such daily facial cleansing needs, but after using the wipes my face always felt sticky and a little gunky. I always have to wash my face after using the wipes, which completely defeats the purpose for me. Also, no matter how carefully I tried, I could never get just a single wipe to come out.	&&&
Best wipes! I tried so many different brands to find the right wipes that has less chemical and these worked out best so far. They are thick and durable, and I LOVE that only ONE comes out when I tug on it.	&&&
It's opened used. The most disgusting thing is the first used wipe was filled back. NEVER GONNA BUY THIS AGAIN	&&&
I use these in the Prince Lionheart Wipes Warmer, the one for cloth wipes. They are two layers of nice, soft, thick washcloths and just one can often deal with a messy diaper change. I fold them in half and soak them in warm water to which I've added one drop of baby bath. (I use Episcencials.) and then gently squeeze them out and put them into the warmer. It holds about a 2 day supply. I just ordered another set of these wipes since I like them so much. They could also be used for a nice experience washing off makeup.	&&&
"Now let me preface this by saying that when I workout I don't sweat very much. I workout during my lunch break at work and these allow me to fit my workout and lunch in a 1 hour time limit. Taking a shower would add extra time. The scent if very light and the towels are high quality and do not rip easily. They don't dry your skin out too badly but might want to bring your lotion just in case.
Very satisfied customer."	&&&
Its cloriox wipes. They didnt leak when i got them and they clean well & smell good.	&&&
i was disappointed however, my face did not feel as clean as it does with a facial wash. i'll probably just use these for a quick cleanup. i did not feel like i was getting the full treatment as i do with a facial cleanser . my face feels really refreshed after a cleansing with a cleaner and water . also my face feels a bit dry after.	&&&
One of the only preservative free wipes on the market. It is hard to pull them out piece by piece - but it will just have do.	&&&
"I bought two of these when I was packing to climb Kilimanjaro. Obviously there are no showers on the mountain, so this was the next best thing if you wanted people to still be able to stand being around you.

I really liked these and they definitely served their purpose during the 5-day climb. Since I only used them for five days, I can't really speak of any effects of using them long term or regularly. However, I did use these all over my body and face twice a day for five days, and I didn't have any reactions then. I have sensitive skin on my face, so I was actually pretty surprised at how mild they were.

Each wipe is fairly large and VERY wet. To clean my entire body, I only needed about 3 wipes. I felt that they were able to remove not only the grime, but also my sunscreen and left my skin very clean. The smell is a bit overwhelming, but it does dissipate after the stuff dries. I think the smell comes from the tea tree oil, which FYI is toxic to hedgehogs. Just a little warning for any hedgehog owners out there.

Anyway, if I were to go on a long camping trip or another mountaineering trip, I would absolutely bring these along. They were a little bulky in the container though, so I would probably repackage them in a thick zip lock bag or something next time."	&&&
These clean up great hands really well with a nice. Items sent, great for off reading	&&&
The scent is good.	&&&
Good for removing makeup	&&&
Great product . Will reorder them for sure.	&&&
So soft. I lkve how soft these are and the fact that they are all natural and safe for babies skin. They do a great job.	&&&
My baby is 5 weeks old and we love these wipes! They smell delicious and pick up everything on her bottom.	&&&
These are reallllllly nice baby wipes, but they are really expensive too. But they are NICE. Honest Company's wipes are comparable.	&&&
Love these wipes! You get TWO packages of these wipes, each with 30 wipes. They're so good, you only need ONE wipe for your entire face worth of makeup. They have these little exfoliating dots all over them which really help to get all the makeup off. I normally have issues with eye makeup remover burning my eyes but this is a very gentle formula. They smell great too! *sample provided for review*	&&&
Convenient large box of wipes. The 3 travel packs of wipes included are great for the diaper bag. The wipes work really well for cleaning and do not irritate my babies skin.	&&&
Use it daily, a good buy	&&&
"My son caught RSV while we were visiting the Northeast. We bought these hoping they would prevent further chaffing under his already hurting nose do to the congestion from the virus. I can not say if his nose condition worsened because of his illness, the extremely dry weather, or the failure of these wipes, but the truth is the didn't do enough."	&&&
I received my wipes sooner than expected. AWESOME!! Great Price.	&&&
Great product . Will reorder them for sure.	&&&
these a wonderful cleansing tissues, gentle and thorough.	&&&
"I actually really love my case. It's cute and I like that I can refill it whenever I want. However, like others mentioned the pop top is just sticky glued on and has fallen off more times than I can count. I could deal with it as long as it stuck back on but after three months it will no longer stick back on.
Also worth mentioning that I can go to a store and buy this for a quarter of the listed price."	&&&
We have been using Pamper's sensitive wipes since our daughter was a newborn, and at almost 9 months old still love them! They are soft and clean well, and have never caused any irritation during diaper changes.	&&&
They smell like something is rotten and make me gag. I'm disappointed in a baby product that has such a heavy scent.	&&&
I really wanted to love these but they gave both of my girls a really bad diaper rash. We've used many brands of wipes and have NEVER had a diaper rash with any of them. Also, these are a little too wet, the flip top is hard to open and the wipes stick together often.	&&&
I use these so much and love that I can get them through Amazon. They are such a life saver for me having a pup who has accidents from time to time plus helps clean up other things.	&&&
I absolutely love this brand of baby wipes for my son. We used to purchase another name brand of wipes but he would constantly have rashes and cried when we used them on his bum. Ever since we switched I haven't seen anymore redness or heard any more crying. I did receive this product for free for review purposes. All opinions expressed here are my own.	&&&
I am in LOVE with these wipes. We have been ordering them for quite some time now and won't go back to the other brands. I love that I can scan the label on the back and it will tell me exactly where my product came from, what's? in it, etc. My baby has sensitive skin and other sensitive brands will break her out. We have never had and issue with these and I love that with the auto shipment I never have to worry about it!!! Thanks Amazon for such a GREAT product!!	&&&
Not Boxed... advertised as if it were in a box, but not boxed. Wipes where strink-wrapped and I am hoping there are actually the number promised... like the promised (and advertised) box!	&&&
These wipes are of good quality and convenience. A very great price and I don't leave the store without them!	&&&
I love these wipes and use them as part of my nightly routine. I also pack them in my overnight bag or on trips when I'm unsure I can do a thorough cleansing at night. It takes off pretty much all my makeup face with just one wipe, but I'll admit they aren't great on taking off mascara. Doesn't sting or feel tacky on my skin afterwards. If I'm drunk, I'm pretty comfortable using just these before I pass out instead of washing my face.	&&&
I love these convenient wipes! I keep at least five bottles in my house at all times. My kids know to wipe things down now due to my , uh, cleanliness lol	&&&
I am a fan of OXO products but this one is a miss. The case is rather bulky and heavy for the diaper bag, but I could let that slide if it worked. When i put wipes in it, they dry out within a few days, making them unusable! So I would have to remember to put new wipes in every day. That's a extra step I don't need as a busy mom. Disappointed.	&&&
These are ok. They are nice and thick but they aren't very wet so sometimes they can be harder to use than other brands. I like that they are better for baby though.	&&&
I Love all Clorox Wipes! Great 100% germ free! Good for door knobs, toilet seats, and for wiping off table spills! :-D I even take them on the go for gross public toilet seats!! "	&&&
I have been very impressed with Seventh Generation Products in general. When we had our first baby I knew I wanted to try to be as natural as I could with products I chose. I am not always able to afford these wipes, but when I can I pick them up. They are nice and thick, great quality and do seem to last me a long time. I like that they are free of scent and don't irritate my daughter's skin.	&&&
My little man is allergic to everything. So when i bought these i just got the travel size hoping that i wasn't wasting money…i didn't he isn't allergic to this kind of wipes…and they are wonderful they clean well and they are durable.	&&&
Excellent purchase price and a VERY effective product."}},	&&&
Just as you would expect them to be. Handy to carry in the car or in a purse.	&&&
"""I screwed of the cap to open and take the tin foil protector off and wipes break off. Cannot even feed it into the hole/feeder to use properly.

I purchaes two packs and it the same with both packages.

Not great."""	&&&
I am really enjoying these wipes for my newborn . it's not harsh on his skin which is what I was looking for.	&&&
These wipes are great as I love anything from Pampers.They get almost everything on the first wipe and I dont have to use as many to get my daughter nice and clean. They smell great I definitely recommend these to any new mom.	&&&
I hate germs. Glad Staples provides this product as their choice."}},	&&&
I used to like these wipes, but they changed the design and now every time I try to pull a wipe out, I end up getting like 4 or 5. Basically, I am wasting wipes because they keep sticking together and so I moved to Seventh Generation because I don't want to pay for wipes I can't or don't need to use.	&&&
Cleans my glasses well. they have to dry a few seconds after I wipe them.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes (besides honest) Do subscribe and save and you will love your life.	&&&
I bought these for my dad and he just loves them! They are thick and have a wonderful clean smell to them. The price was great! I will be reordering again and again.	&&&
These wipes are recommended to me by my ophthalmologist, and this is the second purchase. I like them with one exception (that's why I gave four stars), you have to rinse your eyes following use.	&&&
My husband does not know how to expand the use of a wipe so he uses like 10 when he changes out son! :/ but when he uses the one and done I notice he is using 1-3 wipes! Saves us a lot and saves our baby's butt!	&&&
These used to be the best wipes when they were labeled Think 'n Kleen. The most recent shipment I received is totally different and completely terrible. Prior to the change, these wipes were great because they were thick, and you could do a few wipes with just one. I felt like I had to use much fewer wipes than other brands. Now they are useless! The company is obviously trying to cut corners by changing their wipes to be much thinner. I was shocked when I opened this package and very disappointed. My son is 16 months old, and I have only ever used these wipes on him. Unfortunately my most recent order will be my last. I do not even want to use the other 2 packages (they come in a 3-pack), but I will so that it is not a complete waste of money. I will be searching for a better wipe that does not use chemicals, and I will probably end up trying Babyganics competitors. They really blew it with this change!	&&&
Before I wash my face every night I remove my makeup with baby wipes. They are gentle enough for my sensitive skin but do a great job of getting off all my makeup. "	&&&
"Would not want to live without this now that I have it!

The wipes dispenser is perfect for holding baby wipe refills, dispensing one at a time without any hassle. A heavy plate rests on top of the stack of wipes once you pop them in the container, and you pull them through the wide oval which extracts one, leaving the rest behind. So, no more fussing with pulling multiple wipes apart, and Hello One Handed pulls!

The top opens with just a click when you press down on it, and closes with a simple press down. Could not be easier or more convenient.

Also, it is well made and looks lovely and sleek, so you can leave it out in any room and it is completely unobtrusive. Comes in some cute color bands, too. It's heavy duty plastic but really the whole thing almost appears to be ceramic."	&&&
I am very pleased with the Sensitive wipes. We have been using Kirkland, but I decided to change over to these. I noticed that I can use these Amazon wipes on my toddler's face, and it doesn't irritate her skin like the other brands do. These wipes don't rip and clean up dirty bottoms AND countertops, etc. I like them.	&&&
The purest wipes I've found.	&&&
We love our cloth wipes warmer!! These are the replacement pads and they seem to do the job well. Cloth wipes are easy to keep up with and less chemicals on your baby's hiney. Plus they clean so much better:) Highly recommend this product along with the actual warmer.	&&&
My bathroom can get pretty nasty in a house where I'm the only female with 4 males! These live on the back of the toilet for everyday mishaps! Even my 4 year old knows to wipe the seat with one if he makes a dribbly mess!	&&&
Love these wipes	&&&
Don't leave home without them...we travel a lot and they are a must...	&&&
these are great.. No spray,easy dispenser,clean great. I thought they would smudge but when dry but mystainless stuff looks perfect.	&&&
"it does work
make sure you dont get it in your eye but it does work pretty good."	&&&
The best thing about this product is the fact that it removes ALL stains from fabric sofas: Grease, soda, juice, ink, etc.!!!! Recently had a party, and my guests spilled mixed drinks on my beautiful, red sofa. Lysol Dual Action Disinfecting Wipes completely removed the stains after having set in for more than one month!!!! Found out about this use for this product from my Daughter! She's a genius! And this product is fantastic!	&&&
This product was able to clean all of the smudges, fingerprints and most of the tape residue after a recent refrigerator installation.	&&&
I like the wipes a lot. Good price and does its job right!!	&&&
"These wipes are nice and thick and great to clean hands with. I will definitely be buying them again and again. I Love being able to carry them in my purse and I Love the fact that they are so convenient to use. I also like that they are individually packaged. I really don't have any negatives.
Sani-wipes are the way to go!"	&&&
Convenient, wipes away grease, stains, etc. No need for paper towels.	&&&
I bought a box of these wipes a week ago and so far I love them. They don't seem as moist as Pampers Sensitive wipes, but they better than a lot of other brands I have tried. I also like that they come in a large bulk size.	&&&
My children use them as part of their skincare regimen. I like that there aren't harmful ingredients in them. They like the convenience of only needing to wipe their faces and throw away the cloth. I wish they came in more formulations but they still work nicely.	&&&
I ordered a large box of Huggies Sensitive Wipes, which is a good product in itself. The website price was equal to what I would pay in stores, but the flat shipping cost is $8. I ended up paying $25 for a box of wipes that would have cost me under $15 elsewhere. If you are making a very large purchase (over $150) the shipping might be a good deal, but otherwise Id say, avoid the website and just visit a store.	&&&
This brand of leather wipes seems to clean pretty good and the shine seems to last longer then the leading brand.	&&&
Terrible! I've used other products before but this one is the worst! Once I clean then, I have to use a dry cloth to get the streaks and spots off. And here I thought I was getting a fantastic deal from Costco! ...not so much!	&&&
These wipes represent what a baby should feel and smell like, a baby.	&&&
These are by far the best baby wipes on the market. Since discovering one and done, I've never purchased another brand or variety. I'm a mom of 5, so I'm pretty experienced with wiping bottoms!	&&&
Out of all of the makeup removing wipes/cleansing wipes that I have ever used, these are my absolute favorite. They remove every stitch of makeup, including waterproof eye makeup. I was a never a fan of this sort of packaging (sometimes the wipes dry out really fast), but even the very last wipe left in the package is wet enough to remove everything. Most times I can get 2 uses out of each wipe."}	&&&
Never have and never will use any other wipes! Competitor wipes are pitiful compared to these super wipes!	&&&
Good product at a reasonable price.	&&&
I like that all your eye makeup is removed w/ one wipe. They aren't wet or oily which is nice.	&&&
One of many solutions for keeping my Bulldog's facial folds infection free!	&&&
This being our first little one I want only the best for her- so bought these toe begin with. I like that there are no perfumes or unnessesary ingredients. Trying to go all natural I tried cloth wipes, but they just werent for us. Then I thought I would save some pennies by buying the cheaper off brand wipes- What a mess!!! They were always ripping and it took twice as many to clean up a messy diaper. I buy in bulk from amazon which saves a little and my little one and I are clea n and happy!	&&&
We loves these wipes. My son has very sensitive skin. These wipes are great for his sensitive skin. No bumps are skin irritation. All mothers with babies with sensitive should use these.	&&&
The wipes work well for the price. However, the seller keeps spamming me emails now weeks after ordering this product. Satisfied with the product. Dissatisfied with the seller!	&&&
Hands down the best wipes on the market!!	&&&
Clamps don't clamp down like they are supose to and the bar is really long. Waste of money!!!	&&&
I love Clorax wipes! They make cleaning the dreaded bathroom so much easier & fast. I am confident that bathroom is disinfected!	&&&
Always great to keep around the office.	&&&
I love WaterWipes but pulling them out of the packaging is super frustrating. They just do not pull cleanly. We bought this dispenser to use while we were moving and using disposable diapers in transit and it was perfect for holding our disposable wipes at that time. Now I stuff it with out cloth wipes and it still works great because the weight keeps the stack down and lets me pull one cloth wipe up at a time. Great design on this.	&&&
The cost is great, the wipes work well. The wipes are pretty thick and they don't smell bad, but a little off. I'm happy with these but I feel bad because they're so thick -- it feels like a waste! That's just how I feel about it, I know others won't have the same issues but if you do, you may not want to get these.	&&&
One and done are the only wipes I buy after three kids in diapers at once. The cheaper wipes slip off skin without taking the mess with it. these get it the first time and you use less wipes per change. My kids have eczema and other sensitivities. These do not irritate their skin.	&&&
I love this product! They are gentle and the scent is great. My husband used them on deployment and now we are using them for our baby!	&&&
We usually use Kirkland and those are much thicker and bigger in size. Otherwise it's okay wipes.	&&&
Love pampers products and these wipes are great! I only wish they were the to-go style packaging rather than refill for a wipe container.	&&&
"Pricey, but good product. Pleased that the smell was pleasant, as I hate the overwhelming desire to wash when you are miles from a sink.
I buy these for myself, so I am going to find a less embarrassing container."	&&&
I keep one of these in almost every room in my house. I have two young messy boys and these have been a major sanity saver for myself. It also makes cleaning so much easier. I can get my bathroom cleaned really well in just a few minutes using these.	&&&
great diapers absorbent and would buy again jhghjhvuy	&&&
So easy to use. They are thin but depending on the amount of makeup you are trying to remove one to two of these should do. I even use it to remove my mascara.	&&&
This is an excellent cleaner for hardwood (and likely other) floors. The Sh Mop covers a wide area, and it's so great to be able to replace the worn out mop covers (ours are many years old). We also have two of the microfiber covers for a quick dusting up of hairs, etc between mopping. We use a spray bottle with 1/2 water, 1/2 clear vinegar, spray as we go. It sanitizes the floor, shines it, and when dry, no vinegar odor. No weird chemicals either!	&&&
"This product is great to use when you're on the go or just around the house. I use it the most when I leave my house. My son likes to take his pacifier out and look at it which means sometimes it ends up on he floor. This product does not have a strong ordor or harsh chemicals that can negatively affect my little one and I think it's great. The package is also small enough to fit anywhere!"	&&&
"This hard floor cleaner is better than I expected! We live in Arizona (north west) and our house is primarily tile flooring. Have been using a steam mop for the past 6 years with what I thought were good results. I knew the steam mop wasn't sucking up the water from the floor and was looking for a floor cleaner like my carpet cleaner to get the tile really clean. After using this Hoover cleaner just once I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the floors are now. The machine is what I expected and is easy to use. Delivery was on time and in excellent condition.
The longer cord is a real plus."	&&&
"Great for small messes, I need something that cleans much deeper!!

Perfect. Came exactly as described.	&&&
I love these wipes, just toss them in your purse or tote and go as well as can keep them in a drawer at home for quick lip product removal. It leaves lips clean and hydrated. Longer and lips stains are no issue with these wipes.	&&&
working great	&&&
"Love it i cant live without super nice price !!!"	&&&
Works great and leaves a pleasant smell	&&&
"""My daughter had a very sore nose that eas even bleeding. Within a day of using this product and nose was not as red she was feeling a lot better. Neither ofvus want to use anything else to wipe her nose.

I recommend it all the time to parents and other adults that suffer from allergies."""	&&&
These wipes are pretty good compared to others I have used. Its nice and thick and has a nice scent. My son is use to these wipes and we have never had any issues with these wipes.	&&&
HUGGIES WIPES IM MY OPINION AFTER THREE KIDS ARE TE BEST WIPE OUT THERE. DURABLE, LESS USED IN ONE CHANGE.	&&&
These are perfect for my newborn baby's sensitive bottom. They are super soft yet durable. The best wipes I've tried so far!	&&&
Not boxed like in photo. Just a plastic bag full of loose single use wipes. Avoid "Preferred Mart".	&&&
I can't say I'm a huge fan of these....I love that they are all natural/plant based but I dint think they do a good job wiping or cleaning up. I switched from the Medela wipes to use these to clean my pump parts while at work but I realized very quickly that they leave a residue on everything. I don't know if it is just wrong the milk around but it doesn't seem to clean up at all. It also leaves a bit of a sticky/tacky feeling on things. The Medela wipes didn't do that at all. The price is nice but the product isn't. Others say they work well to use on pump parts but not for me...	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.These are great wipes, right up there with our regular go to brand.My husband likes that they have zero perfume scent, are thick and do not rip!	&&&
Love these. I mtn bike at lunch at work and keeping these in the fridge leaves me feeling cool and clean after. Great price as well. When you can't shower these are a good substitute.	&&&
These Huggies wipes are a must have to keep around. Soft but sturdy. They clean without the mess leaking through to the other side. The packaging makes it easy to transfer wipes into various household and portable containers while keeping the remaining wipes fresh!	&&&
Great for quick cleaning jobs. Use gloves--drys out skin.	&&&
"""With our first son our wipe warmer completely dried out the wipes, so we decided not to purchase a wipe warmer with our second. Our newest little arrived on March 8th and after a few tearful diaper changes I sent my husband to buy a wipe warmer. He came home with this and I almost sent him back to return it because I wasn't convinced on the price!



I'm glad I gave this a shot! It keeps the wipes moist and the temperature is perfect for our little newborn! He doesn't cry at the touch of the wipe anymore and diaper changes are a little more comfortable for him. My only complaint is the size of the product, which only fits about 25-30 wipes before needing to be restocked. We all know babies go through wipes like crazy, however I imagine the size helps keep the wipes moist. It also comes with a car charger which is great for warm wipes on the go!"""	&&&
"I bought this wipes to try it, Im really impressed with the quality of them and I love the fragrance of fresh scent.

I recommend this wipes to everyone who ask for wipes, and I hope Amazon start selling diapers too."	&&&
Great for carrying on the plane to wipe down seats and arm rest. also to wipe down seats in the airport. we touch a lot of places when we are out in the public but, we can cut down on some of our own germs by just wiping down the areas we use, to include our own automobiles.	&&&
Best wipe holder! This is actually our 2nd. The 1st one had a piece break and wouldn't stay closed. I would have rated it lower because of this, but it keeps wipes moist, opens & closes easily, is cute, and the weight really works to help you only dispense 1 wipe at a time. The nice thick wipes don't always dispense one at a time, but it's still better than anything else out there that I know of! It makes buying wipes in bulk make sense!	&&&
Babies need and deserve the best care and products that provide tender care. This set of bamboo washcloths provides excellent cleaning with ultra softness! I am a huge fan of bamboo products. They are not only high quality but good for the environment since it is sustainable. I was intrigued when I saw this colorful set of washcloths was made out of 100% bamboo! I was very excited when I given the opportunity to try this set and review it for a discount during a promotional launch. They are easy to launder, because they are machine washable! The arrived safely and just as described in a reusable clear bag with snap closures. This packaging makes this set perfect for gift giving!	&&&
A very good Wipes. We take it for care of the sick woman, who 101 years old.	&&&
These are my fav I use these for everything! With kids these are a must!! Lol	&&&
The perfume smell is overwhelming and the wipes are sudsy. Super disappointing and un-usable.	&&&
Clorox wipes, easy clean up. Enough said, buy them.	&&&
Good for hands and face. No scent and easy clean up. Very happy with the sensitive ones - ordered online since the local stores don't carry.	&&&
Not good for an eczema baby.	&&&
full of bad chemicals	&&&
These are perfect. I don't like the huggies ones bc they are too thick. These are tough and thin and have the right amount of moisture. They remind me of the Sams or Costco brand of wipes which were great until the sams ones had bacteria growing in them. But we switched to these and are very happy with them!!	&&&
PERFECT FIT!	&&&
I really do like Clorox Wipes. In fact, I like them so much that, when I run out of them, I begin to go into Clorox Wipe withdrawal. I can do without just about any other cleaning item on the planet but not this one. They are even good for removing stains on clothing without causing any damage to the material. I've wiped up stains on the carpet with them too. The kitchen counter feels and smells clean after using one of these wipes. I recommend Clorox Wipes to everyone.	&&&
Great Product!As a member of Smiley 360 I received this product free to try. This is a great new product for women that suffer from this condition. it is gentle and effective...not to mention nice smelling! Give it a try you will not be disappointed!	&&&
My baby got a rash because of the perfume on the wipes. As my mom said your baby got a rash b/c I apply a/d every change and never let her sit in a dirty or wet diaper. I did an experiment and changed to another brand for a few weeks and then tried the luvs wipes again and her rash was back. The remainder of the wipes are in the bathroom for mom n dad to use.	&&&
These wipes did the job in removing makeup but the wipes were too dry like it didnt have enough makeup remover in the package. They kind of made your skin feel dry afterwards too. Overall, they work ok but had a few drawbacks.	&&&
These are great and I always buy them at Costco when we're in the store. However, "Kirkland Signature" is charging TWICE the price for them here in order to get them into the Amazon Prime program. Lame.	&&&
I buy the Sensitive wipes for my son because he has excema and breaks out easily. Pampers Sensitive wipes not only clean his diaper messes extremely well (I only have to use a few wipes instead of like 20 generic wipes) but I also keep Pampers wipes in my vehicle and kitchen! I use them to wipe up messes, wash my son's hands and mouth, clean his feet, dust the vehicle, wipe out booster seats at restaurants, wipe up small messes on the countertop, clean up handprints off my s tainless steel fridge, and a million of other uses! These wipes do it all, are soft and gentle and well worth the price! You'll find you can't live without them. I can't!	&&&
great deal and good quality	&&&
Nice and thick; hold together really well when used. Suit my baby's skin - the wipes are soft, gentle and do not irritate his skin.	&&&
I received a free sample of Boogie wipes in a gift bag after registering at Buy Buy Baby. I was skeptical about them at first. To me it seemed that they were just glorified baby wipes, but after my little one had a major cold I saw that the boogie wipes didn't dry out his skin while the normal baby wipes did.	&&&
I received this product for free from SMILEY360. Never tried this product before. So, now I can say this product meets my expectations: made from high quality ingredients, contains natural Witch Hazel + aloe and chamomile. Works really well. Very easy to use and dispose, good size, moist enough, discreet.	&&&
"So far I really like this warmer. I use purified water to wet the little pad that goes inside and the wipes don't dry out or turn brown. I would recommend this to anyone who has a lite one who hates cold wipes, especially if you have a boy ;)"	&&&
Love these wipes	&&&
Love these wipes. They're great on my newborns sensitive skin. Imneven comfortable enough to wipe down her face with it since she doesn't get a rash like other wipe companies. The only thing I'm not to crazy about is that these wipes do dry out, BUT! It's no problem as long as they're put in a wipes container Disclaimer:I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own	&&&
Great wipes. Don't "shed" like pampers sensitive do	&&&
These smell amazing and tear easily. Pampers seem to shred when you pull them out of the container. Huggies, you really don't need to send a new wipe dispenser with every box of these. I have had to recycle so many wipe containers.	&&&
After watching videos and reading reviews I purchased one. With 2 dogs and a lot of traffic, this is the real deal! It cleans easily and folds in half for convenient storage. You won't ever have to clean or scrub on your hands and knees again. Great product, you can see the dirty water! Cord is nice and long and has 2 separate tanks, one for solution with water and the other that sucks in the dirty water. Suction is excellent. Used on laminate floors, tile and vinyl and they are came out beautiful! Thank you Hoover!	&&&
These are so good to have with you when your out running around and just want to make sure your fresh,or even when your excersicing!	&&&
Too thin of wipe with so much soap. Hard to clean off muddy paws.	&&&
The are the best in the restroom, the smell is wonderful.	&&&
Wipes smell really good and great for when they do number 2!	&&&
These wipes are adequate. I feel like I've purchasad higher quality ones at best buy before. Always great customer service at the Riverdale Coon Rapids Store!	&&&
Exactly what my bulldog's yeasty nose rope needed.	&&&
Definitely gentle and mild, but nearly impossible to pull only one out. Ended up switching to cloth wipes and water after fighting with these.	&&&
this stuff calms sensitive skin, and has sunscreen. It's great stuff.	&&&
These are the best wipes I've used. They are gentle and never irritate!	&&&
Decent value	&&&
Perfect in my craft room to clean up my tools with alcohol. Strong and absorbent.	&&&
Useful for removing make up."}	&&&
These are great products--price is reasonable and you can carry one or as many as you need with you.	&&&
Convient and clean...great combination	&&&
They are kinda thin. I prefer the huggies one and done... They're MUCH thicker, but Can't find them in the store, and Amazon wants $23.00 for a 184 count refill that normally costs $8-11.00 for THAT size refill.	&&&
my box arrived damaged, looked like it had been dropped kicked, but luckily it was just the box that was damaged, the wipes were fine.	&&&
I really loved these so am sad to write this negative review, but the seams attaching the zipper to the case broke on both of these within 6 months, and I cloth diaper so only use these very rarely for travel purposes. If the company could solve this issue, it would be an amazing product.	&&&
I was very interested in trying out Amazon's baby wipes. I like the packaging because it's not a plastic tub, but still has the flip top that closes securely. My only issue with them is that when I am mid-diaper change and reach for a single wipe, I always pull out more than what I need since they don't separate on their own when you pull them out. Aside from that, they are great wipes for a fantastic price (I never like to pay more than $0.01 per wipe).	&&&
Good for quick cleaning at home or for the car.	&&&
The green tea is the best wipes out there i've tried the rest and they're not as good as this one.	&&&
They do the trick.	&&&
Anytime I need an easy and fast helper to clean, I rely on Clorox wipes. They always do the job, every time.	&&&
"My daughter has been sick twice this winter and I only use the boogie wipes because it doesn't make her nose dry and it smells great. She loves them to because she never let's me wipe her nose with anything else but boogie wipes she loves."	&&&
I love everything about this product! I use them for everything, every day! I have a need to know what is considered a 'safe' age for children to start using the wipes? I have an overly ambitious helper on my hands and need to know. Thank you!	&&&
good product, love it for greasy hands, cleans them up nice. thanks	&&&
Perfect for most surfaces...disinfects and deodorizes	&&&
Hopefully I'm not the only one who doesn't mind spending 20 minutes putting makeup on, yet loathes spending 20 minutes taking it off! I can never seem to get my waterlines clean with a wipe since they tend to irritate my eyes, but that was not the case with these! I was able to wipe off every trace of mascara and eyeliner in a swipe or two with no pain or tearing up. I love how clean they leave my skin feeling and I especially love being able to go to bed that much faster! I did receive a discount on these but price says nothing about how effective they are!	&&&
I really like these and use them daily. They are food grade, so safe for your baby.	&&&
Sorry for the lame review, but it's all I got here.	&&&
Bought it for the family to use and everyone loves it over the spray.	&&&
Great for any cleaning project. I don't like germs or dust, so I use it for everything!	&&&
I love these wipes! They are awesome! I have already recommended them to others, for both babies and the elderly!	&&&
I love this Aveeno product and the price is good.	&&&
A clean butt is a happy butt.	&&&
To much money for wipes that stick together and that are just water. Cheaper to make yourself	&&&
I love these wipes. I have a 6 month old son and was given a pack of these as a gift when he was a newborn. These are the only wipes I've used since. They are moist, wipe easily, don't tear(like I've seen some brands do) and clean well without having to use a ton of them. This is a great price for this size box. I wish I had found it sooner.	&&&
i like these wipes	&&&
Love these wipes. They work really well and clean my make up right off and leave the skin soft and refresh	&&&
Works great! Warm cloth wipes every time!!!	&&&
I love this productss I like the way it feels on my skin	&&&
"Love the wipes they are wonderful been using them since my son was born
I Recommend them to everybody"	&&&
I am excited to get to use these when my son gets here. It's an excellent price for so many wipes, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the plastic pouches do reseal.	&&&
We usually buy the sensitive wipes. These are thinner and have a strong perfume. I gave them away to a friend.	&&&
I like the wipes natural qualities but they are really hard to get off the packet when you need more than one.	&&&
"When BJs discontinued my favorite wipe and changed their formula, I was in search of a new wipe. The wipes from Target just don't cut it and BJs' new baby wipe is terrible. The Huggies wipes rip easily and irritate my son's bottom. The Pampers wipes are good, but they are really wet and kind of slimy and they don't have any kind of ""grip"" on them.

Along came the Amazon Elements wipe, which I had low expectations for. I was pleasantly surprised! They have a nice pattern which allows them to clean and grip my son's bottom. They have not irritated him and they do not have a real scent. The pouch they come in has a nice snap close and they work well in my Perfect Wipe dispenser.

While I miss the wipes from BJs, these are an excellent substitute and I will continue to order them."	&&&
This is something that is essential when you have a baby. My baby just turned one and I still use this on a daily basis. I also give this to every new mom or mom to be. Its great because you can open it one-handed which obviously is important when you have a baby. There are a bunch of different colors to choose from which I think is great. My wipes never have dried up in this because it has a seal that keeps them wet. You can fit a lot of wipes as well.	&&&
I use these to clean my Shih Tzu eyes, decent product and much less than dog specific wipes. Also if I personally need a wipe these are perfect and the price is just right.	&&&
For some reason these wipes are different from the way they were previously made? I specifically wanted Earth's Best wipes because they were the softest wipes I'd ever used for my kids. But now they feel very similar to Huggies/Pampers wipes. I am disappointed, but either way they get the job done.	&&&
Item arrived in good order and as described. Thanks.	&&&
Okay. Dog able to get out of the wrap. Tape not too good. Very absorbent when stays on dog	&&&
Pampers have great products...except for the wipes. The wipes smell great and are super soft....too soft! They do not clean very well and basically just wipe over the mess. We have them and use them to wipe faces and clean up messes not on the body, but they just don't work that well for messy diapers.	&&&
After a few months, it no long has a tight seal causing the wipes to dry up. don't overfill it, not even a little bit.	&&&
loves these wipes	&&&
These are smooth clothes unlike the ponds cleansing clothes that have a rigid pattern. These are also very moist cloths. Some brands are dryer which means you have to use more and it tugs your skin and doesn't get eye makeup off. I plan to order more of these when I am done. For the price they're great and takes off all of my makeup, even the waterproof mascara.	&&&
great eye glass cleaner. no mess or smudges, great for kids	&&&
These are the best wipes. Great for babies with or without sensitive skin! They don't break and are super thick for the worst messes. Highly recommend!	&&&
"I use these wipes for many purposes, including: wiping my kitchen counters, cleaning my bathroom sink, and cleaning my desk. Occasionally, I'll even use them to wipe up messes from my floor. They smell about like you would expect, but it fades eventually. As is the case with many convenience items, these are not great for any one purpose, but you can sufficiently use them for many purposes. Overall, I would recommend them (or something similar) for use in the kitchen, bathroom, or office."	&&&
Fantastic wipes and only brand I trust	&&&
I love these wipes. They glide across my little ones bottom and just one wipe is enough even for the messiest of her diapers.	&&&
Works as advertised.	&&&
I love these wipes!!	&&&
"I love these so much!! They feel a lot better than toilet paper and not to mention cleaner feeling too!
Thanks Charmin"	&&&
Good quality wipes - 4 in pack, good value-for price	&&&
I like this much better than the Simple wipes I was using. They effectively remove my eye makeup and are soft on the skin.	&&&
These are literally the worst wipes Ive ever used. They are overwhelmingly perfumed, and I had to use more than one to get my makeup off. Then they left my face red and burning, and the smell, I just cannot believe they would scent something so strongly. YUCK!	&&&
They work wonderful. I love all huggies wipes!	&&&
These wipes I have found to work the best and they smell so good.	&&&
These do a wonderful job of cleaning my eyeglasses and cell phone screen.	&&&
"I loved that the wipes are easily accessible from the package. There is also no residue left from the wipe and no taste which I love."	&&&
I always buy these when I run out. It is an amazing product.Its affordable and easy to use. I always store these disinfecting wipes in the kitchen. Its great to keep in the house just one wipe cleans and disinfects."	&&&
glad I got these for those minor touch ups. love it, as they don't streak my stove top. does'nt work well on heavy soils, but perfect for just light weight cleaning, which is what I wanted it for.	&&&
I buy these wipes all the time. Very convenient! I use them in the kitchen (Lemon Scent) and bathrooms (Fresh Scent).	&&&
used to get similar product from a vet website. This is just as good at a better price	&&&
I received this product for free for purpose of my review. My opinions are 100% my own. Preparation H Wipes are fast and discreet - they're perfect for on the go. They're individually packaged and good for when you're out and about. I love not having to go through some messy creams. These wipes are not overly damp, are a good size and they're infused with chamomile, cucumber and aloe. They are very delicately scented and give you the relief you need on contact. Using these wipes and making sure that I stay hydrated, have a high fiber diet and get plenty of exercise has cut down significantly on my discomfort. If you haven't tried these, I'd highly recommend it.	&&&
I could not live without my Clorox wipes. They are perfect for small messes or cleaning up the kitchen in general.	&&&
Have bought these over and over. Best scent in the market for "disinfectant wipes"	&&&
"The ""milky residue"" the Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes leaves, needs to be buffed off. If you've got major grunge on whatever you are cleaning, of course, you should clean it off first. Think of it this way, you wouldn't wax your car without washing it first, would you? And, you wouldn't put wax on expecting it to wipe itself off into a shine.

I use these wipes on the stainless steel parts of my stove, my grill and stainless stell microwave. It works brilliantly and leaves a great shine. I absolutely love these wipes. As with most wipes that dispense out of these containers, the top wipe can get a bit dried out, so before using them, I flip the container upside down for a few minutes so the liquid saturates the top wipe I pull out to use."	&&&
It's very basic and has a mediocre scent, nothing special. It gets the job done but I've had better wipes for our dogs.	&&&
Pampers baby fresh wipes are by far my favorite. I received several different brands of wipes and diapers at my baby shower and out of all the brands Pampers baby fresh is my favorite. They are so soft and smell so good. I can definitely tell they are made with lotion with how soft they feel and how gentle they are on my baby's bottom. I have also used Pampers sensitive and those are great as well..especially if your baby has allergies or anything, luckily my daughter doesn't and I can use the baby fresh just fine. I will be trading in all my other wipes for Pampers baby fresh!	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes is one of my favorites that I use here in my house, it cleans and disinfects, I use it all the tme for everything. I actually cant stay without it. I received this product complimentary from Influenster"	&&&
Great option for women. Soothing and gentle product. Effective and nice scent!	&&&
We have been trying out different wipes that are free of chlorine/harsh chemicals. The ones from Honest Co. pleasantly surprised us - these are much thicker/stronger and easier to use since they are cloth wipes. Eventually we will switch to reusable cloth wipes, but for now these wipes seem to be the best bet (claim to be biodegradable). Pricing/shipping at nordstrom.com was very competitive as well...	&&&
I use these daily for quick clean-ups.	&&&
Opened the bag the first time and none of the wipes were very wet. Used it on my son before he went fishing and he came back in about 10 min with five new mosquito bites.	&&&
These wipes aren't my favorites. I'm a huge fan of pampers diapers, but these wipes just feel funny to me. They don't get her bottom clean enough. I have to use far more of these than I do either seventh generation or huggies wipes (funny, I hate Huggies diapers). In short, when I run out of these I probably will buy a different brand of wipes. I do like that they're soft, and they also have no scent at all. I'm crazy about using I scented things on my little girl!	&&&
We do the subscribe and save and always receive our order just as expected!	&&&
one of my best purchases, I want one in every room because they are so easy to use!	&&&
So handy, no home especially with family should be without. Makes for easy quick cleaning of multi-use places in home like bathroom sinks and counters, toilet seats back of toilet tank outside bowl.....perfect.	&&&
I use these every night to remove my makeup and they work better than any wipes I have tried! Others have made my face feel like its burning, these are cool and refreshing, no sell and no harsh chemicals.	&&&
This is my second SpinScrub and it works better than a larger, earlier model. The squeegee picks water up off the floor better. This also works well with finished wood floors.	&&&
Staples Screen Wipes are easy, fast and effective. I use them on my smart phone and both my laptops and tv screen."}},	&&&
Love this product	&&&
"Excellent product. Easy, convenient, removes makeup well and leaves skin hydrated."	&&&
These are great. My son loves the smell and so do I. They are so convenient as well. They fit perfectly anywhere. I like the semi big package for the diaper bag and I love the little packages for my purse or pocket. I highly recommend these. I used to buy the sensitive wipes so I could occasionally wipe his hands or face ( I know you're not supposed to use wipes on face, but I figured since they were the sensitive ones it'd be ok) and he still got a little rash. These brings the boogies right off. No fight, no redness. I do have trouble when I'm trying to clean his nose and he's following the wipe every where trying to lick it because it smells so good and he thinks it's candy. Other than that it's such a great product."	&&&
I am a member of Smiley360 and was given this to try it is great I will tell everyone to use them they are very soothing and work great	&&&
Don't want to order this anymore!!!!!!!!!!	&&&
"These things are so cool. Fascinated with their concept, I ordered EZ Towel and Wysi Wipe to compare brands for our extended backpacking trips. Here’s what I found:

At first when I wet them and laid them out, I thought they were identical to each other, but they are different. They seem to be made of the same gauzy-like material, but EZ Towels are somewhat thicker and sturdier. I love that the EZ Towels come with a storage tube that holds ten of their wipes. The full tube weighed in at 1.3 oz. I then refilled it with ten of the Wysi Wipes, which weighed 1.1 oz. But because the Wysi Wipes are slightly less bulky, I was then able to add three more to the tube to give a total of thirteen wipes instead of ten.

Pricing: at the time of our purchase, the EZ Towels were $8.15 for a 50 count. That put them at 16.3 cents each. The Wysi Wipes were $12.97, or 12.9 cents each. Perhaps they are the same price per oz. But! I just saw that Wysi Wipes also has a bag of 500! So, of course I had to calculate that too. Cost is $45.66, kind of hefty, but now the wipes would only be 9.1 cents. Good to know.

I can see the benefit to using both brands. I may even put a combination of them into the tube for different uses. The thicker ones will make good dish cloths, for one thing. Our family will use them on a trip in a couple of weeks to put them to the test. I’m not sure you should put these down a privy even though they say biodegradable. I will be ordering two more bags of the EZ Towels just so we can get two more tubes, one for each of us for our packs. Then we’ll also have a nice supply of these wipes."	&&&
Before I begin, I understand these are intended for babies... These are extremely small. If you lay one over your face it barely covers your entire face. If you are buying these as an alternative to a face wash cloth I probably would search for something else a little bigger. Sucks washing your face with a itsy bitsy wash cloth. WHAT IS THIS A WASHCLOTH FOR ANTS?	&&&
Great wipe for newborns/infants, so delicate yet firm hold and doesn't tear easily and smells SO GOOD!	&&&
Fast shipping. Item just as described. Great!	&&&
Soft, strong, gentle... perfect wipes for my newborn's tush!	&&&
Love these wipes. They're the only ones I'll use on my 2yr old. A new baby coming soon and I'll just be buying them more frequently :) My only complaint is that they include the plastic wipe disposer bin every time. I wish that there was an option to not receive it because I just immediately chuck it into the recycling bin. My old disposers (that come with the wipes) work fine for 6 months to a year. Don't need a new one every month.	&&&
highly recommend, family loves this. Love the convience. Use everyday.	&&&
I use a CPAP machine to assist with my sleep. I use the "The Sensitive Skin Wet Ones" to clean the mask before use each night, between weekly mask washings. These do not have any odor and have never caused any issues with the skin on my face during the 5 years that I have used the CPAP equipment. I have tried other brands and they have caused some irritation.	&&&
These wipes are typical wipes that clean well enough, but not strong feeling. Thick enough that they don't tear when using, but not thick and strong.	&&&
The lysol had leaked out when I opened it was soaked and I am concerned the the wipes will dry out. I was also concerned because my order contained food items. I do not think it's wise to put food and lysol wipes in the same box. I have cancelled the lysol wipe subscription.	&&&
"This comes in handy when were out and there is nowhere to wash off her binky. Life saver!!"	&&&
This is the only product is on our household	&&&
Wipes are very strong they don't ripp easily like timer brands, they smell good and cause not rashed.	&&&
Works great!	&&&
Love this product. Hands seems to be cleaner then Purrell hand sanitizer	&&&
Huge containers, bigger than the store size. They will last forever. I love the way I can wipe my stove and it removes the grease from cooking. I don't need windex to shine it either.	&&&
Cleans great, and leaves a nice scent.	&&&
Theses are great! They remove my makeup easily and without irritation. Perfect package for traveling too!	&&&
"These wipes are a life saver, I use them on my 19 month old, 5 year old and I'm sure I will with baby #3. I use them for my 19 month old stuffy and runny noses and with my 5 year old who has allergies. I even tried them on my husband (sinuses) and he loves them. They work instantly and loosen up mucus. The saline in them is awesome since my little one sometimes give me a hard time with the spray. I take these everywhere!"	&&&
I don't like the scent of these wipes. And I have to wring them out before I use them, but they get the job done.	&&&
These are the best for cleaning hardwood floors. They have nice tight elastic to hold them in place. they wash up wash too. This is my 2nd order, I don't have enough to do my whole house.	&&&
Can't see how it removes heavy metal, doesn't seem to remove ordinary dirt that well. Cleans my hand about as good as tissue that Wal*Mart hands out by the shopping carts for disinfectant.	&&&
These wipes do just what they're supposed to. The scent is light and fresh, but some may want more texture...as the wipes are pretty basic. The resealable bag doesn't always stay shut, especially after several wipes have been dispensed. However, these would be great in a reusable, resealable box.	&&&
Thank you	&&&
great easy to use and easy to put away. though i do have to say if you don't close off the top well enough they will dry out, and if you don't use them often they will eventually dry out. even though closed the top doesn't create a seal good enough to keep the moisture in so that they don't dry out.	&&&
it works fine and does not sting so my small niece does not mind when I occasionally apply this on their skin compared to when I apply the eucalyptus product. unfortunately this product does not long too long (need to re-apply for all night protection)	&&&
Worked awesome , just wish more came in a pack :-/	&&&
I really like these wipes, however, like some other reviewers I'm really disappointed in the smaller packaging. These wipes were already fairly expensive, and now they are even more so. I think I'll be looking into some other natural wipes to replace these. Unfortunately, I hated the smell of both the seventh generation and babyganics wipes.	&&&
An absolute disappointment. These are very small in size and with hardly any sanitizing solution included. What we thought was a good deal on price really wasn't. A classic case of pay more, expect less.	&&&
I love this product. Not only is it super convenient as a wipe and quickly applied, but this is ALSO a mineral-based sunblock: it uses oxides of Titanium and Zinc. Mineral-based sunblocks form a physical block of the sun's harmful rays. Think of it as applying pieces of rocks over your skin. This is just like the iconic white mask seen on lifeguards, but it uses nano-particles, so it absorbs into your skin and disappears. Mostly all other sunscreens are chemical based. The chemical based sunscreens degrade over time in the sun and have to be reapplied frequently. Moreover, they have been shown to be endocrine disrupters. Physical sunblocks work longer, cover a broader spectrum of the sun's rays, and do not sting or burn because they are just rocks.	&&&
I like the scent of these wipes, they are thick, and these packages can be used on-the-go. This particular order had "Frozen" characters on them but who cares.	&&&
These wipes are amazing! So soft, and I love the fresh, clean smell! Very thick and durable. I use them for everything-taking off makeup, washing my hands etc. The price was great too. Will definitely order again.	&&&
I bought similar wipes at CVS for far less money, and the product was good. I like these and find them handy. But I won't buy them again due to cost	&&&
I really like this product. I just wish the sheets were just a little bit bigger.	&&&
These are very convenient wipes in a handy container that makes it easy to pull one sheet at a time. You can also refill this tub once you are done with refill wipes by Huggies. The wipes themselves are soft and moist and are great for the originally intended use but if you use them to wipe rougher surfaces you will see residues as they tear rather easily due to its softness (which is a plus for the intended purpose of wiping after babies).	&&&
Pampers sensitive wipes work best for my baby. I use less wipes per changing than the other brands available and they are just right for my babies skin.	&&&
Was not packaged for easy use in a purse. This is my wife's statement.	&&&
Perfect for cloth wipes.( I don't soak my cloth wipes and keep them dry and it's still work perfect) Im very glad i purchased this container. I cloth diaper and wipe and have not found a container that would just stay still when pulling a wipe out. This works perfect for my cloth wipes. I don't have to worry about using two hands to get a wipe out. I don't soak my cloth wipes and I do use dry cloth wipes and a spray bottle for cleaning. The cloth wipes I made myself. I cut up 2 of the receiving blankets (flannel blanket) into 16 squares each. They ended up around 7"x7" each. This is perfect if you're wondering about cloth wipes that you keep dry. You don't have to worry about weight. I can hold about 32 cloth wipes in this container.	&&&
needed something better than then cleaners i had used in the past and thought i would try this hoping would do a decent job. trying it for the first time i was amazed itworked so well and was so easy to use.	&&&
This are great to keep in the car for puppy licks and nose prints	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes line of products and always use them on my kitchen and bathroom countertops and other surfaces. The smell is so fresh and clean!	&&&
My husband has around-the clock nursing, home visits by the doctor, R.N., and physical therapist. That's a lot of hands bringing in germs to his room, and using these wipes has helped prevent his even getting a cold for years (knock wood). His bed and bed table are wiped-down after each visit, and they leave a very pleasant smell in his room as well as clean the surfaces of a multitude of germs.	&&&
The Pampers Sensitive wipes are great for little ones with ultra sensitive skin like mine. Other sensitive wipes just don't match up.	&&&
My favorite facial wipes. They have a fresh, clean scent and gets all the makeup off my face. Some other brands were too harsh on my facial skin and irritated it. Not the case with the Simple brand. These wipes are gentle and keep me coming back.	&&&
The best invention ever! Beyond buggers these wipes clear off dried on food better and faster than baby wipes. I do like these small packages over the round container which dries out to fast. I can't believe I ever though these were a silly invention. EVERY parent needs these.	&&&
I love these wipes. They smell great and are super soft for my daughter. And are a great price too.	&&&
Great bath cleaner!	&&&
Keeps mask fresh. I use this on the mask when I wake up and again before putting it back on in the evening. It has no obvious scent, dries quickly.	&&&
Zoe, my Brussels Griffon puppy, loves it!	&&&
Great for on the go, always moist wipes when you need them.	&&&
I bought these on sale at Target-attracted to them because it was a natural cleaning product. I'm very happy to be cleaning naturally however these wipes have a terrible smell! They smell nothing like the lemongrass and citrus stated on the container. Worst of all though is that the scent lingers for quite awhile. I had to open the bathroom window to air out the bathroom and get rid of the smell. Maybe it's just me, but when I clean with something I expect a pleasant if not olfactory pleasing smell left behind. I would not buy again	&&&
Love them! Gently on our little one, you must try.	&&&
They are great when my son doesn't have time for a shower in between PE class and his next academic class. Give them a try.	&&&
I have never had such difficulty with a wipe in my life. They are dry in my opinion and stick to the skin while I try to wipe my son's bottom. After I used these when I switched from Pampers Sensitive, my baby developed his first rash. I only switched because I was given two huge boxes as a gift, and I do feel bad. However, I do blame these wipes. I discontinued using them and switched back to Pampers Sensitive and viola.	&&&
I love this for personal wipes. It makes the bathroom look so much nicer than having "baby-wipes" on your grown-up counter.	&&&
Smiley 360 gave me the opportunity to try this great product and submit a review. I am delighted they gave me the chance to do so! The flushable wipes are so convenient to use. Not only are they convenient but so much easier than ointments! The wipes leave a clean soothing feeling. I would recommend trying Preparation H Medicated Wipes for Women!	&&&
haven't used them yet, bought because of the good price. Will come back and update once I start to use them.	&&&
would've preferred a top opening, but I guess they're refills meant to go into a dispenser. We carry them in the truck with us to have on hand as hand and face wipes, so I just use a pocket knife to cut a slit on the top for an opening and a gallon zip lock bag to keep them from drying out. It works.	&&&
Smells so fresh and my cats enjoy being wiped with them. Plus non-toxic!	&&&
I must say I am not a fan of Huggie's daipers, but their wipes are the only ones that we buy! Perfect texture and amount of moisture.	&&&
These face wipes are perfect. They don't burn my face as many others do. My face feels so clean when I use these, almost as if I used a cleanser! They are very concentrated and one wipe can remove all my face makeup and eye makeup.	&&&
It's fair, it was safe on the hands in that I don't see my hands drying out, but I do have to use quite a few wipes to remove grease off kitchen cabinets. It does leave a bit of a streak on kitchen counters, so I had to use another cleaner to get the shine on the granite. I used this on a wall to remove dirt off a wall where my kid had his feet put up against over the last year, I've a few photos, works pretty good on walls with an orange peel finish, in my particular job, I used about 6 sheets to get most of the wall clean. If the wall were smoother, I could have used fewer sheets. I would use this on my home repair type projects and probably not so much for kitchen cleaning, although it does work on grease. Not a complaint, but the dispenser does not really work that well, I kept having to remove the cap to pull out new sheets because as soon as I tore off one sheet, the next sheet would fall below the cut line. Not a big issue, just an inconvenience.	&&&
"Smiley360 gave me the opportunity to try this product for free and submit a review. Opinions are 100% my own.
Preparation H wipes for women are handy to have as they are packaged individually and make it easy for on the go. These thick medicated wipes are very soothing made with cucumber, aloe, vitamin E, Shea butter and chamomile. They really help give relief when dealing with hemorrhoids or just when you want that extra level of freshness. They also have a pleasant smell and are flush-able. I highly recommend to anyone who suffer from itching and burning. This wipe brings great relief."	&&&
This is a great product for women. It is gentle and soothing and I would recommend this to any woman..	&&&
HATE. These smell awful. These feel gross. And I switched to Huggies :(	&&&
I've tried toothbrushes on my small dogs before but it's just never worked. I don't feel like I have any control with a brush. With these I can control the pressure and direction much better. You need to be careful to hold on to them well though.	&&&
"“I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”
I love how refreshing this product is. After having 2 children I have suffered from occasional flare ups of hemorrhoids and these wipes are a god send!"	&&&
I would and will use this product over any brand out there.	&&&
I love Papmers sensitive wipes. It is more soft and works great especially at night time.Very soft and make the baba have a good dream. Love love	&&&
I used this to clean every electronicical component in my house and it works wonderfully. No smears or anything. It also seems to add some sort of anti-glare to my lens and my monitor, which I approve of.	&&&
I gave Pampers wipes up completely after the first time I used these wipes. They smell amazing and make clean up so easy. Maybe amazon will come out with makeup remover wipes.	&&&
"We use Boogie Wipes and Schnozzle every morning and evening to help our son's congestion."	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. My son has a very sensitive to allergy to fragrances and it has been hard to find wipes that don't irritate his skin. When I tried these wipes on him he did not break out at all! After doing more research on the product I found out that the wipes are free from fragrances, parabens, phthalates, alcohol and dyes. Which amazes me because it works better than Big Name Products. Definitely will buy this product in the future.	&&&
If you want to make sure things are thoroughly clean; you've found the right disinfecting wipe. I'm particular about cleanliness and clean everything with a duster, which is then followed by wiping all my surfaces down. These wipes smell great, are durable and convenient! You can't go wrong!	&&&
The best wipes I have ever used for my family!! My son has sensitive skin just like mommy and daddy and these work for all of us! Never ever had a rash, super gentle and gets the job done. I love these and can't live without them. Super soft for my little baby's toosh and great for his hands and face. Also great for removing my makeup.	&&&
Great deal on this larger package of diaper wipes. After having 5 kids I still say Huggies are the best wipes	&&&
"""Have used these wipes since I had my first daughter.

Used them on everything: pacifiers, toys, bottles , cups. Whatever fell on the ground!"""	&&&
Aside from stock photo needing to be updated - there's no complaints with this product. The Flight Wipes anti-bacterial wipes are a wonderful investment for someone on the go or a multi-person family.. since you receive 6 packs of these wipes, you can share them if needed. I keep on in my purse, one in the living room, one in the car and three for later! They are super moist and I appreciate the packaging they're stored in as they keep wet and don't dry out.. and also, the scent is not over-powering as other wipes and brands can be. If you like to be sanity and find you can't carry your beloved liquid gels and cleaners with you while travelling, then I do recommend this product for your needs. I'm really excited to have been a part of the special coupon deal so I could receive this for a discounted cost to evaluate and give an opinion on.. If you have any questions, just post them and I'll be happy to answer as best as I can.	&&&
"This new version of the Member's Mark wipes are a big step below Pampers and even Costco's Kirkland brand wipes. While there are more total wipes than other bands, the wipes are noticeably much smaller. I would measure one, but I've already returned them.
Additionally, these wipes are noticeably drier than other brands. Because of this, it is more difficult to wipe up feces and because of their smaller size, it seems that more wipes are needed to finish the job.
So, while you may initially think you're getting more wipes for your money, you're not getting that value in reality. Because of these issues, we returned them to get our money back and ended up buying Pampers wipes."	&&&
These wipes do an exceptional job at removing face and eye makeup. As part of my nightly facial cleansing routine, I use these wipes followed by a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil for a fresh face before bed. This box contains both larger and smaller packs of wipes. The small packages are great for traveling or for going to the gym to wipe makeup off before working out. the patent pending resealable package stays sealed and works well. The wipes have just the right amount of moisture on them, and don't drip or feel to dry.	&&&
They are easy to use and smell nice. I use them for wiping my hands down after drawing blood. They work well.	&&&
"We keep this product for everyday changing. When I first put my wipes inside I was disappointed, because the wipes tray wasn't wide enough. I could fit the wipes in but it was about half an inch shorter than the wipes so the whole standard pack wouldn't fit. I saved the rest of the wipes and thought no big deal.

I'm still home with the baby so I use the wipes in the warmer frequently as I change her diapers every couple of hours. I started to notice that the first wipe was kind of dry. If it's more than three hours the first wipe is too dry to be effective. I had it on the lowest setting.

Now I have just shut off the heat. I'm not interested in wasting a wipe with every change. So my wipes are still cold and I wish I hadn't wasted my money."	&&&
I love these wipes, Ive been using pampers wipes on my daughter since she was born. They clean very well and you dont need very many even for the messy clean ups! They are very gentle on the skin, even thought they are unscented the lotion and aloe give a very clean smell.	&&&
This is a great product. I use it every night before I go to bed. In fact, both my mom and sister use it too. It takes off all my makeup, leaves my face feeling super clean, and oil free.	&&&
I use my Clorox Wipes to clean my toilet because I know the stuff is clean--DP	&&&
Great cat wipes that keep your cat's coat smelling good and clean.	&&&
I lived by a Costco and I got used to using these because they come in large quantity and with babies and kids you need large quantities. We now live 4 hours from the closest Costco and I have missed these wipes the most out of everything from Costco. I was forced to use other brands that rip, smear, stink, and don't clean well. I love Costco wipes the feel, size and how they clean. They are a little thin, but because they are so large, I just fold it in half. I am so happy that I can order these online now!!	&&&
Great for the quick clean up of those little messes made by little people and dogs!	&&&
Works just like my old one, which didn't have as much sucking power anymore. Love it for all of my tile floors.	&&&
dont take up space and holds perfect amount for on the go.	&&&
You can just stick a few in your back pocket ... and off you go! Love 'em!	&&&
"This was great to have, especially during the freezing winter. Make sure you buy the replacement pad. As long as you keep up with moistening the pad every week, it should last you 2-3 months."	&&&
As great as the Purell name, and great service!	&&&
i love the value on these. large pack for a great price. non irritating wipes. makes me feel good that my baby is always nice and clean after a diaper change.	&&&
Don't have enough liquid on them to really clean old marks. Great for quickly wiping a board though.	&&&
Use them all the time	&&&
Very handy to have on hand. Works well.	&&&
Excellent product. This was a re-order. I put them in my son's lunch--he uses one before and the second one after he eats--great convenience at a reasonable price.	&&&
Love it. Smells great	&&&
Very nice and smooth material for baby. Easy to wash and reusable. Good bargain for the price of 6 pcs.	&&&
Love it! Best healthy alternative to all the baby wipes out there	&&&
They're great for the bathroom, but also for when we're camping! Sometimes I use them when my face feels dirty or I need to remove makeup.	&&&
These are so good to have around for your EDC, picnics, day trips, hikes, travel and numerous other events.	&&&
Simple and handy	&&&
Love this to keep in my car!	&&&
The scrubber was very easy to set-up and use. It's amazing to see the dirt that accumulates in the receiving tank. This scrubber has a vacuum so if you need to vacuum something up while using the floor scrubber, it's right there! No going to get another vacuum !! I actually had this recommended to me by a "high end" builder, so I felt comfortable using it on my new wood floors. So glad he suggested the Floormate. Home Depot, by far, has the best price. I'd say you can't lose with this product .	&&&
I like these and use them fairly often but one complaint-they taste terrible!! I was wondering why my baby was crying and pulling away, and then I licked one-YUCK! I use water wipes for her diaper, and now I just use a (clean) one of those instead. much cheaper and no bad taste!!!	&&&
Was a gift for my daughter to use on my new Grandson so those typically COLD wipes aren't so cold and so far so good as to the design and function of the product.....Of course my grandson is a bit too young (one week old) to comment on the product himself.	&&&
So glad Sams has these wipes again. I love the texture and the smell is not overpowering like others. I prefer these over all others & I have twins & change a lot of diapers!	&&&
Perfect product.	&&&
It did a little but not like it say it deal	&&&
Greatest product ever for anyone sensitive to fregrance or chemicals. Doesn't leave residu or smell after use. Perfect for on a go person.	&&&
I'm quite disappointed with the quality & strength of these Huggies One & Done Refreshing Baby Wipes. They are soft & feel thick, but they seem to tear quite easily... ick! Just about every sheet I've used has torn a hole in them. I'm just glad I didn't order several boxes of these. You get an empty plastic canister for the wipes & 2 fairly large zip bags full of the wipes. I just do not think I want to swap softness for the fragileness these seem to have. I don't like to end up with "poopy" hands! For me, these just don't hold up to the "job at hand" ;) I'm going back to the cheaper ones I buy at Walmart.	&&&
The BEST wipes out there. They don't leave any lint.	&&&
great item works the best out of all other products	&&&
best wipes on the market and they tear in half easily if needed.	&&&
The quality of this product is absolutely amazing I won't use any other brand I've tried the bargain brands and they just fall apart when I wipe my son with them	&&&
Great Product	&&&
can not live without they r great for everything and anywhere	&&&
I use this product every night to take my makeup off. After the first time I used it, I have never used another brand. One wipe will remove all makeup and leave skin feeling great.	&&&
They are wipes and they work I just wish there was a dispenser included I don't feel like I should have to buy that separately everytime.	&&&
"I always go for the easy options when it comes to cleaning...I particularly love the ability to eliminate whatever mess or dust is offending me and throwing the wipes away. The smell isn't too strong, and I don't find it offensive like I do many other cleaning products. I especially like the packaging...they are easy to keep all over the place. I use another brand of cleaning wipes as well for more substantial messes (like if a puppy has an accident), but keep a pack of these by my desk...in my car...in my husband's truck...in my room...you get the point. They're kinda everywhere!

They work relatively well, although I do wish they had some that were a bit fluffier...so that they would hold onto a bit more dust and dirt. I would be able to get away with using fewer wipes (although that might be the point...).

I also wish they were a bit cheaper. They aren't unaffordable for us at the moment...but for the number of wipes per package, I feel that if they lowered their prices a bit they would still be able to make money, while also making them more affordable for more people to buy as many as they need, when they need them. I do keep these on subscribe and save to help make sure that I don't run out."	&&&
The wipes are also great for cleaning faces and messy hands. You can have peace of mind knowing that you are providing a safer, natural option for your children. Thanks WaterWipes! Glad to see you in the U.S.!	&&&
I decided to give these a try after some not-so-fresh days of long runs. These wipes are big and thick and you don't have the feeling that your finger is going to go through them if you know what I mean. I'm not some sissy, but these things work good and no one needs to know you use them. They say flushable, but I'm not sure how they could be since they are so thick. I throw them away just to be safe.	&&&
I work in Information Technology at a high school. Beside the fun technology stuff, there is some dirty work, and I mean dirty. Keyboards and Mice have been proven to have higher colonies of bacteria than public restrooms. So in order to help prevent the spread of bacteria I wipe down all the Keyboards and Mice often. These disinfecting wipes have had no deleterious effects on our equipment. Additionally, I wipe down all my cooking and food prep areas with these wipes. I have also found no harsh effects on my skin from using these wipes, and they have a pleasant smell. I highly recommend this product.	&&&
I have found that these wipes work best out of any of the other brands I have tried. They seem to be a little longer than Huggies (which get stuck in the container so I can't pull them up but have to open the holder to grab one). These are a good quality and soft but the nicest thing is they easily pull out of the reusable container.	&&&
These are definitely the best on the market. All of Huggies wipes are thick & great quality and I would recommend ANY of them to a friend, family member, etc. I prefer these ones in particular because of how gentle they are on my little ones, even with the worst diaper rash. These are definitely my go to for all 3 of my babies.	&&&
I know I probably shouldn't, but I'm one of those awful people who use these. I try to use them sparingly, but they really do get you so much cleaner! I just hope they never pull an impacted glob of wipes out of the sewer line the size of a city bus - that freaks me out. If you don't know what I'm talking about, Google "fatberg" GROSS.	&&&
"Recently, I had an unfortunate experience with a backed up plumbing system in my bathroom. The plumbers came and fixed it, but you have no idea of the mess that resulted. After scrubbing everything thoroughly with a sponge and a chlorox solution, I felt I wanted to go over everything one last time. I bought these wipes and they were so easy to use. I felt that I was disinfecting the floors, appliances etc, but there was no bad odor. I cannot emphasize the ease of using these wipes. I will definitely be purchasing them again."	&&&
Very useful wipes when you are using reusable diapers. They do the job, and you keep helping the environment.	&&&
Nice, sturdy, durable, and fits an entire bag of wipes and then some. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.	&&&
I love these Flight wipes...It has a fresh scent..And great for travel..I have kept these wipes in car....At times when we travel we really need these wipes to sanitize and make ourselves germ free..Especially with kids this is an essential thing in your bag...It fits perfectly in my purse..I take these wipes wherever i go and even put some in my kids bag so that it comes handy .Its non alcoholic it will not dry your hand...No residue... I am very happy with this product...Glad to receive this at a deep discount in exchange to my honest and unbiased opnion....	&&&
I used the wipes for a few days, by the 3rd day my skin started to burn and I know have big patches on my face that are rough, dry, and burn like. Anything that I put on my face, even aloe and coconut oil irritates it. I can't even touch it with makeup, and I work in a professional setting, and having a red blotchy face is not good. Very unsatisfied with this product.	&&&
These sanitizing hand wipes from Purell are amazing! I first discovered them at a Chick-Fil-A restaurant when the cashier handed me my drink with the Purell wipe resting on the lid. These wipes are a nice size--5 in. x 7 in.--and do a great job wiping away germs and "generic" dirty stuff from hands. They also dry out fast, and leave a clean smell behind, not perfume-y like some pre-moistened wipes are. Each unopened wipe package is not quite an inch and a half square, and fit in purses, pockets, suitcases, duffelbags, first-aid kits, or wherever a quick antibacterial swipe might be needed. If you are wondering whether or not you will get your money's worth in buying this box of 100 individually wrapped sanitizers, wonder no more! These little gems are worth every penny.	&&&
The first time I tried these wipes I was really taken aback with their softness and strength. What a find! I highly recommend them to one and all, young and old, female and male. Who'd a thought that something so soft and effective could be so durable---even re-usable---and as pure and clean as new fallen snow. And they're so completely degradable that I'm almost persuaded to throw them out my car window----(almost).	&&&
These are not only natural but they didn't leave a rash on the bum.	&&&
Love them just that they are alittle. Otherwise i use them everyday	&&&
I've ordered this product multiple times - I LOVE it. It removes my waterproof mascara and eyeliner with ease and smells great. Originally, I thought it was oily or something, like it left residue on my face, but I've gotten used to the "feel" of it. It's not oily at all, it's just the moistness from the towelette that I felt. I won't use any other brand now.	&&&
We have used pampers sensitive baby wipes on our son since he was born. They are soft and cleans amazingly!	&&&
I love huggies wipes, these were great.	&&&
I can't write anymore than has been written by others. Do yourself a favor, get this product pronto; BLISS	&&&
these are great to have in your purse! you could use them when your on your period or whenever you feel like you need freshness! they work great and take any order away"	&&&
We have been using these wipes since our son was a newborn (he is now 2 years old) and have never had any problems with skin irritation.	&&&
Gave my grand daughter terrible diaper rash switched to Luv's and no more diaper rash. Took baby to the doctor for rash he said to try didn't brand it did the trick, he said a lot of times in Huggies the skin can't breath with is ok for some babies but not for other's. Rash has been gone ever since I quit using Huggies."	&&&
I use Clorox wipes in all areas especially kitchen and bathroom areas. It's a quick simple way to stay germ free, they smell great and get the job done. Also don't forget to wipe down all small areas too - light swtiches, door knobs and even remote controls. I prefer the lemon scented ones"	&&&
My baby girl has very sensitive skin. I had to eliminate chemicals from her products. She had so many rash issues with Pampers Sensitive and Huggies Natural Care diapers and wipes. I switched to cloth diapers, but was still using Huggies wipes. She still had rashes. So, I searched for wipes free of harsh chemicals and the Honest wipes seem to be the most gentle. Within one day of replacing the Huggies wipes with the Honest wipes, the rash is gone. It still hasn't come back. They are thick and work great! They are not slimy like Pampers and don't tear like Huggies. They are perfect!	&&&
Love these wipes for my baby's sensitive bum. They stay moist compared to other brands	&&&
Great for wiping poo. Smell good. What else is there?	&&&
These wipes are wonderful as they do not cause my baby's sensitive skin any issues. Great wipes:)	&&&
Easy clean up anywhere in the house. Easy to use. Kills germs. Clorox is my kind of brand I use everywhere."	&&&
These baby wipes do get the job done and are moist enough to work. However, I wish they were stronger and more durable. They tear apart to easily which can sometimes make it messier during changing time with shreds of wipes everywhere.	&&&
Easy way to deal with a baby's new teeth and mouth without having to torture them with a toothbrush.	&&&
I only use pampers on my little girl since day one!!	&&&
I brought this product just as a backup and I love it. It works 100 times better than the original one I purchased. It stays warm and my baby loves the warmth. It seems to be very comforting for her even for a full body wipe off.	&&&
It does what is suppose to do, durable	&&&
These wipes have been a life saver for my little one who is allergic to every brand/type of baby wipe on the market. These don't irritate her skin at all and they clean up messes well. The moisture level is perfect too and the wipes themself are soft, but strong. I do use extra caution not to touch any of the wipes except the ones we are using to avoid contamination. I am fearful that bacteria could grow easier since they are just water. I haven't had it happen yet, but you never know.	&&&
Our little boy has sensitive skin, and these are the softest wipes and they do a great job cleaning too!	&&&
Works great for times you can't shower, two wipes took care of me after a Spartan race.	&&&
I was very excited about this purchase but it turned out to be a big disappointment. First issue we had was the wipes wouldn't fit into the container and when we finally got a brand that fit in the container, the wipes still wouldn't come out without ripping. Even on the highest sitting the wipes aren't very warm. The product claims to lock in moisture but our wipes are always drying out. All the moisture collects on the clear lid, and even though we have only had this product for a couple weeks mold began to grow on the hinges of the lid. I would say the only good thing about this product is the light on the top, everything else is terrible.	&&&
"These wipes really come in handy, especially durning cold and flu season. We use them around the office all the time. The three handy sized containers make it easy to stow away. The fresh clean scent is an added bonus."	&&&
These are pricier due to the individual wrapping and branding, but they are pretty good. Sometimes, especially for those with health issues, just toilet paper doesn't cut it. These are a nice solution so you can keep one on you if needed since the other brands all come in big dispensers.	&&&
"Started a subscription for this because I am due to have a baby this August and wanted to start stocking up in advance. The price was decent for subscribe and save for a box of 6, but unfortunately when the first box shipped I decided to cancel and go with something else. I trialed them out on myself and I can say a few cons to the product: 1) The sticker on top starts losing its adhesiveness after about one week. 2) when you pull a wipe out, 2 or 3 more come with it. Kind of a waste. 3) the wipes themselves are not very large or moist. I can see this getting messy with diaper changes.
So I switched to the Seventh Generation thick and strong wipes with the flip top case. A tad bit more expensive, but I hear they are much better."	&&&
These are every bit as good as Cottonelle inbdividuals and cheaper.	&&&
These wipes are not what I expected. Very thin and looks more like mesh than normal wipes.	&&&
I have to say I have to give these Brooklyn Bamboo Baby Washcloths a 5 star review. I wish I could rate these more than 5 stars. First I love that they come all packaged in a very nice package with each washcloth rolled and tied with cute ribbon. Just with that would make these a great baby shower gift for that mommy or expectant mommy. These are sooooo soft.. Did I mention how really soft these are. Well I just have to explain how soft and gentle these washcloths are. I used these on my daughter the other night and I have to say they are just the right thickness and boy do they lather the soap just rest. we had sudsy soap with a gentle wash down. I loved how I got the soap out just right and the wash cloth still stayed very soft. I hate running into stiff ones but theres no stiffness in these soft babies:) I am def buying another package for my newborn nephew. These state they could be used as wipes. They def are gentle enough to. I recieved these in exchange for honest unbiased review which is 100% my own and may differ from yours or others.	&&&
Smell of these wipes seemed to have improved from the last time I tried them. I'll add two stars as a result. Again, the packaging and quality of the wipes is superb. My only real issue has been the powdery feminine smell which I think Aloe Vera contributes. I've noticed it less with the second purchase I made.	&&&
I bouught the Cleaning Duster and Monitor wipes at the suggestion of the Best Buy sales associate. I admit before I bought these, I was not sure how good a job they would do on my computer. I tried the Cleaning Duster first. It did a great job in getting the dust out in between the keys on my computer. It is easy to use and does a great job! Then I used one of the Monitor Wipes on the screen of my computer. The Monitor Wipe did a great job cleaning the screen of my computer with no streaks! I am glad I bought these items as they do a great job!	&&&
We use these all of the time to keep insulin infusion sites on and for IV shields. It doubles the length of time the site adheres to the skin. I'm going to start using these for band-aids on locations that they usually don't stay on long.	&&&
I've tried about 3 other sensitive skin makeup wipes and these are the best hands down! Zero irritation and a FULL FACE of makeup with ONE WIPE! I will be buying this again & again :-D	&&&
Saves me time from taking showers, love it. I get tired of having to shower daily, great to use if your wife complains.	&&&
I love everything about Pampers wipes! They are amazing!	&&&
These wipes work really well. I was told by the salesman I was buying my dishwasher from ( it's stainless ) that these worked really well. He was no kidding. They are great.	&&&
These are terrible! How can a product specifically marketed to bald men make a product that can't hold up to a little stubble?? You'll spend the next 20 minutes removing strands from the wipes off your head after every use. Do yourself a favor and buy the "baldguyz" wipes. Cheers	&&&
"These have to be the softest Baby washcloths I have ever purchased before. These are so super soft that they are perfect from newborn to toddler stage, especially if your baby's delicate skin is prone to dry skin or rashes. Asher has had a really bad bout of Pneumonia as well as the Flu this past week and as you know, when that happens, especially with a fever as well, babies have runny noses and their facial skin tends to get very dry. When we would use a wipe or washcloth to clean his face he would cry in pain. Once I received these and felt how soft they were, plus the fact that they were organic, I knew or at least hoped this would be the answer we were looking for and thankfully I was not disappointed and I had a happier baby when we wiped his face. Bamboo is naturally soft and these really are just perfect. We were able to wash his little face without him crying at all because of how soft these were. These are a great size, 10 x 10 and are perfect not only for just facial washing but for the entire bath. Many other Baby washcloths you buy are so small that it's hard to really use them and normally I end up using a regular sized washcloth, but now these are the only baby washcloths we will use on Asher and Lilly. We also cloth Diaper and prefer to use as much organic items as possible, and we use cloth wipes as well and make our own cleaner. We actually have now started using these as our cloth wipes because they are bamboo and organic which makes them perfect for using on delicate areas to clean. We simply keep them in our wipe containers ( we have one for the Diaper bag and one for home) and just pull one out and put a small amount of our homemade cleaner on them and they work excellent, especially if your child ever has diaper rash, I would highly recommend these. My Friend was over and changed the baby's diaper last week and raved about these Organic baby Washcloths and actually decided to order a couple of sets for her sister who is about to have a baby as well. These would make a perfect addition to a new baby gift basket as well and the colors are great fro either a boy or a girl. I plan to order another set just for myself because I think they wold be great to use on my face when I wash it and clean off my makeup.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, all opinions and statements are based solely on my own experiences with the product."	&&&
Best wipes so far!	&&&
This is my fault for my desk a work. I grab these wipes to use for my desk artwork daily. Keeps my work area, clean, disinfected, and fresh smelling. Love it.	&&&
These Cleansing wipes are great. I use them at night before I go to bed. They make my skin feel so fresh and clean. It works well in removing the oil from my skin. I am definitely satisfied with the quality and thickness of the wipes. They are definitely worth the price.	&&&
End of day When i hv no time to clean my face this wipes cover it all answer"}	&&&
No joke. The best product we have ever purchased to clean our boat. This was the only product recommended by the manufacturer of our boat. Being new, we want to keep it looking great. After a few weekends of partying we had a lot of scuffs and black marks. These wipes cleaned every one of them with minimal elbow grease. Great product!	&&&
Gentle on the bum, larger than most wipes and a fantastic price!	&&&
This review will be tricky as it can only refer to me and my skin type. I have been dealing with acne on and off since I turned thirty...sucks for me. I've cleaned, toned, washed scrubbed, inscribe etc. I started using dermalogia wipes once in the evening and this product has proven to be very effective against reducing the amount of acne flare ups. Leaves my face feeling deliciously clean. This will be my big staple when I travel to France this year	&&&
These wipes come in handy when you need them. I always keep some in my bag when traveling.	&&&
We use these to wipe toddler hands in our church nursery. They are not super wet, which is good for our purpose, and it helps to reduce possible allergen residue, which is a great concern for us. We have used other wipes, but these don't have as strong of an odor as some and the alcohol free is great for little hands. I would recommend these wipes.	&&&
We actually like these more than the Clorox wipes because Lysol does not bleach your clothes if you rub it against you. They clean everything very well. Convenient and useful dispenser. Great deal on subscribe and save	&&&
These wipes are amazing. So much softer than the Walmart brand. Takes less to use during a mess than generics also.	&&&
I have purchased this for my daughter, who is expecting early September. I purchased it because of the functions it offers. It looked like it would be a good addition to their nursery needs. Also, another new mother told me that it would be a nice thing for new parents to have.	&&&
These wipes were perfect for my daughter just the right amount of softness and they clean really well.	&&&
The only eyelid scrub that really works. I need to order more as there is no store in Bozeman that carriesit.	&&&
The exfoliation side was a bit rough for my sensitive skin. However, when used very gently it wasn't as bad. Great that the other side can be used a regular cleanser/make up remover.	&&&
Bought for my sister in law for her first baby and she loves them!! And they are soooooooo affordable!! Can't wait to try them out myself!!	&&&
Fab. Great that they're flushable.	&&&
I'm running out and need more! I have the spray but sometimes you just need to wipe and go. I love that it doesn't have harsh chemicals in it.	&&&
I wanted a disposable washcloth as I like to have a clean facecloth each night, and for travel to countries where hotels typically don't provide a facecloth. These are small, convenient, and disposable but fall apart once they are wet and I try to wring out the excess water. I couldn't wash my face with them alone and absolutely couldn't use them to remove facial cleanser. They are so fragile, I'm not sure what you could use them for. They certainly would not hold up for washing off a child's hands and face while at the park or camping. You couldn't use them to wipe counters or handles.	&&&
It really can’t be avoided that white boards start retaining marker stains after a while. When that happens, just use this and problem solved!	&&&
Love these wipes!	&&&
i wish it was air tight, the wipes dry out	&&&
"Nothing cleans hard floors the way this product does. Highly recommend for anyone who wants really clean floors without back breaking drudgery.
Arrived quickly. Highly recommend"	&&&
we are using these as cloth diaper liners not as wipes. they are great as liners for easily getting the dirty diapers dumped into the toilet but as wipes I needed to use too many at one time.	&&&
"I am in love with these organic bamboo washcloths that I just got for my baby (she'll be here soon!). I have had a lot of washcloths in the past, but these are amazingly (and surprisingly) soft. I'd recommend them to anyone as a shower gift. The pack has 6 cloths (2 yellow, 2 white, 2 green) and come packaged in a plastic wrapping each tied with a green/white polka dotted ribbon. Just perfect to either put right into a gift or take out and add to a gift basket.

Each cloth is 10x10 - and I appreciate this. Too many ""other"" washcloths are teeny! I'm so excited to use these on my new arrival.

I received this product free in exchange for an honest review."	&&&
"Love love love love love this. My son is now 3 and potty trained, but we still use wipes on the go. I wish they would've made this 3 years ago!

It's the first on the go wipes dispense we've come across that keeps the wipes wet, holds a good bit (about 1/4 of a large refill package), doesn't leak into my bag and makes the wipes super easy to take out 1 at a time. We've used the organic baby wipes since my son was born as a result of his uber sensitive skin. The hardest part of those wipes is getting them out of the package one at a time and keeping the package sealed in my bag! With this dispenser, getting the wipes out is a breeze and no more wipey leaks into the bottom of the bag! One at a time, no mess, no hassle.

The only downside for me is that you have to make certain that you do not to overfill the dispenser. If you overfill it, it will not properly close which could result in some leakage or the wipes drying out."	&&&
DO NOT ORDER these from BLUE FADE MARKETPLACE. Their product is straight up DEFECTIVE GARBAGE. I've used these wipes for years and they do work great and are very convenient to carry if you don't received a DRIED UP BATCH WITH NO SOLUTION ON THEM. BLUE FADE MARKETPLACE charges Return Cost + 20% Restocking fee to return DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, and you'll have to get Amazon involved just to get this resolution.	&&&
I have been using these water wipes for about two years now and love them. I haven't had any problems with black mold, but I am careful to not contaminate the remaining wipes when I pull out the wipes. I also do not repackage the wipes into another container or bag. I love these water wipes and use them for everything; bathroom, car, school, office, sporting events, etc. It smells like paper and water.	&&&
I love the Clorox wipes for everything in and around the house. Bookbags for the kids, remote controls, door handles, places where people forget to wipe as well as countertopops, sinks, childrens play toys. I keep a container in every bathroom. Also they dont leave that streaking behind that most wipes do and it has a nice clean scent, it doesnt smell like a hospital.	&&&
I have used these wipes pretty much since my son was born. With the exception of trying some knockoff brand wipes (that didn't last very long ) I love them! They also don't have any negative reactions on the sons sensitive skin or his eczema.	&&&
I love these wipes, so so much. They're gentle yet very, very effecting in cleaning, and they're so inexpensive! They do an amazing job removing all the make-up and grime from the day, and leave my skin feeling clean and not stripped. My skin is somewhat sensitive, so everything from the feel of the wipe on my skin to the cleansing formula matter. These wipes are not thick but not thin, they feel soft but are very sturdy and have a gentle texture that cleans everything away. I alternate between only using this before moisturizing before bedtime, and using this before using the Elemis cleansing products.	&&&
These are the best wipes out there for when your kids have a cold, they are so soft, smell yummy, and don't make your nose raw or sore. We always have these on hand in our house and could never go without them!!	&&&
We have 24 of these wipes in our cloth diaper stash and love them! A few have stained, but who cares? They're cloth wipes. I wash with my Flips diapers and bleach monthly with the inserts, which does remove most stains. Would definitely buy again if I needed to, but after 6 months of use these have held up beautifully.	&&&
I live how cloth like these wipes are. They are much better than the cheaper brands	&&&
Clorox clean up wipes are my favorite wipes hands down !!!! They smell great and work even better. They are easy to use and i love that they get rid of a ton of germs !!!	&&&
Smell bad, and cause diaper rash. I have to rinse it by water then use it on my baby's butt. I will go back to the sensitive wipe. And the refill packages don't have an opening on the top, I have to take out all the wipes and put them in refill box, which cause the wipes get dry really quick.	&&&
I dislike these wipes. Though it is strong it is littlebit soapy so I always need no dip it in water , squeeze and then use. Otherwise it slips from hand or on baby's skin.	&&&
Works great and is a good natural alternative but the wipes have a very strong botanical scent that lingers.	&&&
I keep a pouch in my car, in the diaper bag and one in the house. I Love them for runny noses and/or crusty noses for my little one. They're gentle and work Great!	&&&
"I use this product on multiple surfaces...my desk, cabinets (made of pine), computer monitor, keyboard, and even computer mouse...and it does a very good job at removing any dirt/grime/grease. The little baggie reseals by itself (you simply fold the cover back over and it has a small piece of sticky material to keep the flap closed), and it's easy to remove one wipe at a time from the bag., much like you remove kleenex from a box.

What I also like about these wipes is that, while they are moistened with cleaning detergent, they also soak up fluids a good bit. I've cleaned up a trillion soda spills on my desk with these wipes, and didn't need a paper towel to soak up the soda...these wipes did the job by themselves.

They are strong enough to hold up for any basic cleaning tasks...they never fall apart during wiping.

I'd recommend these to anyone looking for a quick solution to wipe up any sort of dirty/dusty surface."	&&&
These cleansing wipes are the bomb! Quick, easy cleaning. Size of wipe is adequate to do both lenses. I use these wipes for glasses, Smartphone, tablet, etc. Store some at my desk, in purse and at home. Often give them away to friends/family; then they're hooked!	&&&
"Very useful, keeps wipes in place, easy to use/clean, keeps wipes wet."	&&&
These wipes rip way too easily. They dry out super quickly as well. Not my first choice in wipes.	&&&
my son doesnt need the sensative wipes but when he tried them they worked just as well as any other wipe.	&&&
I love these wipes! I use them almost every day for cleaning. They are amazing! And I love that they are sold at costco! Got big or go home, we buy them in bulk and have them stored in each bathroom and the kitchen!"	&&&
These wipes aren't terrible. They get the job done and they are a good price. But in this case you get what you pay for. The wipes do not come apart when you try to take one out of the container. So you end up having to shake and shake and shake it to get it to come apart. Which is very annoying when you are trying to wrangle a wiggly toddler with one hand. The wipes are also very thin so I always felt like I was getting mess on my hands when I used them. I also wasn't a fan of the container they came with. The design of the lid just isn't the best, in my opinion.	&&&
There is nothing like a natural product and these wipes are pure water. My 5 month old tried all brand names wipes out there, alcohol free, hypoallergenic, no fragrance, etc and the diaper rash was not getting away. Until I found this product. Literally, these wipes save my baby's but. As of today I just use these wipes and the up? diaper rash from target.	&&&
Little expensive, but great/convenient for quickly throwing this in your diaper bag. Wipes are sturdy and thick.	&&&
"These are my favorite wipes. I am now on my second 12-pack box and will continue to buy these while my baby is in diapers.

Pros:
--High quality--big, soft, never tear
--Good ingredients--no chemicals or scents
--Very moist--easy to clean without rubbing
--Convenient--easier than making my own
--No residue

Cons:
--Package could be easier to open.
--Sometimes closure starts to fail before I use the whole pack.
--$$ I wish these were as cheap as the Kirkland ones, but I think they're superior enough to warrant paying more."	&&&
Love the product but this order arrived with a completely soaked and damaged inside box (the product must have leaked). We only use these wipes on our son's face or hands.	&&&
I'm not too picky when it comes to buying wipes. Luckily my daughter doesn't have sensitive skin so i can buy different brands. I only buy papmers wipes when they're on sale or i get a good deal with coupons. In my opinion they arw very then and break apart too easily.	&&&
Best wipes there are!	&&&
I have tried all of Pampers' wipes and love them all! Always have a good scent, always cleans well, are always soft and never dry!!	&&&
One container leaked a bit in the box by seeping out of the lid, but that just resulted in a disinfected doorstep - enough moisture remained to keep the wipes in good shape. These rarely tear coming out of the container and do a good job at wiping down surfaces, but they have no scrub texture so they don't really pick up anything crusty.	&&&
I purchased these but I don't remember seeing anywhere on the advertisement that they where "kitchen wipes" maybe I missed it but I am still using them on everything and they work great	&&&
Pampers baby fresh wipes have more liquid to clean up even the worst of messes. Some of the other brands are really dry and don't clean very well.	&&&
Absolutely do not like Huggies wipes, they are too rough feeling.	&&&
all purpose wipes. work great.	&&&
Quick delivery and product is as expected.	&&&
These used to be my holy grail makeup wipes, and I would purchase them 4-6 times per year. Unfortunately, the formula has been changed recently. I am so disappointed. I do not have sensitive skin, but these towelettes irritate my skin leaving it red, stinging and dry. Don't even consider using these around your eyes now - major burning. Plus I think these new wipes are drier than before making it more difficult to remove makeup and necessitating too much rubbing. Ouch. These are no longer usable for me, and I will no longer purchase this product. The previous formula was more moist, did not sting my skin, and left my skin feeling a bit soft. They were so good before. Why the change? Please, bring back the old formula of makeup wipes!	&&&
Use them all of the time. Work great. The glass wipes don't leave any streaks, the cleaner wipes clean, and the leather protectant wipes leave leather soft, clean and shiny.	&&&
These wipes worked well, I just prefer the unscented ones.	&&&
I like the weight of this warmer. It doesn't lift up off the table when you pull a wipe out. However, it doesn't warm the wipes very well (I tried multiple brands of wipes thinking that was the problem). Also, the lid locking mechanism doesn't work very well sometimes and it opens up when you pull a wipe out. I am returning this.	&&&
I tried the amazon wipes not expecting a lot but they are great. The only wipes I like to use now. Great price too.	&&&
The fact these not only clean but they disinfect too makes these a major thumbs up for all your needs. Car Uses like car seats and doors and they also male great diaper bag size to wipe down those high chairs and tables also shopping carts each time. These smell great have no bleach in them so really the most handy multi purpose cleaner made. This Invention was one of the best in my time.	&&&
I bought these because of some of the reviews. I cannot use them though because my newborn had gotten so irritated from the wipes that his little butt was raw! It does have a chemical scent to them as well. I threw away the box so I cant even send back what I have left! I now use pampers sensitive wipes.	&&&
"I love how soft these are. Unfortunately, they don't really absorb or hold a wipe solution. So I use them after ECing, to wipe after spraying the bottom directly. Work great for that.

Plus I'll keep these around for colds after diapering to eliminate the need for kleenex."	&&&
Great when traveling!	&&&
I thought these wipes worked amazing for my two little ones. I have never met any babies that had sensitive skin like mine! These wipes do not irritate them at all and are strong enough to use half as many during changes! Amazing wipe!	&&&
My favorite wipes.. although more expensive then the pampers wipes.. they are more on the dryer side but i like it because it oesnt give my baby a rush. they are super strong and thick so usually just one would be enough!	&&&
I love how thick and strong these wipes are! I prefer these over huggies and most defiantly over pampers. They are not over wet as some leading brands are, they do not have any smell that I can tell. There is no concern over your finger going through these wipes at all and they clean very nicely. The only complaint that I have over these is the resealable packaging. a few times of opening and the sticky part starts losing its sticky. I fixed this by putting the wipes in an old huggies container.	&&&
I love these wipes because they are mostly water (and a little grapefruit extract), so I feel safe using them on my baby's hands as well. Each wipe is pretty wet so it does a good job of cleaning up poop. Does not irritate my son's skin. I will order these again.	&&&
I received this product sample for free to review. I really like these wipes for my daughter because they are gentle on her skin. She has somewhat sensitive skin and these never seem to irritate her skin and when she does have a diaper rash, the wipes never seem to burn her skin or make her flinch when I use them. No weird smells from the wipes either!! I've used the wipes on my own face to test them out and I haven't noticed any issues!	&&&
I got these hoping that not only would it keep the paci's and teething toys clean but wouldn't leave a nasty residue or gross taste, and these totally passed! Love these! No more using wipes to clean bottles or pacifiers on the run!	&&&
Have used this for years on my children and love that I can get them in a bulkier size and delivered to my door. Whenever my children have runny noses this works great because toilet paper and Kleenex can make their poor little noses so raw. This is a great alternative to wet wipes because wet wipes have so much perfume in them that if their nose is raw, it just burns. My children have no issues letting me wipe their noses with these when need be and I highly recommend them!	&&&
One of the best lens wipes available. Excellent price for the quantity received. Also, the lens wipes have plenty of moisture. Highly recommended.	&&&
It is a really messy process and I would recommend it to anyone. It hardly gets any hair off and to get the wax off is pretty hard itself.	&&&
I love my Lunette! I bought this kit as a first time cup user after a lot of research. The Lunette cup has been working very well for my body. The wipes are great for the times when I'm on the go and need to clean my cup. The soap cleans my cup and smells great, which is a plus during a messy task. I'm very happy with all of the Lunette products I have been using.	&&&
we use these wipes all the time. They are so soft and even with the messiest diaper they ALWAYS do the job! Other wipes are very dry and you have to use numerous wipes to get the job done with Pampers wipes its as easy as 1,2.3.	&&&
Huggies wipes are our favorite. They are thick and not slippery like other wipes, so they clean well. We won't use anything else!"	&&&
"These wipes are wonderful for frequent diaper changes, especially if your baby has sensitive skin. Our daycare changes diapers every 90 min, and after switching to these wipes, our baby girl didn't have a red hiney anymore; and we could stop using desitin! We buy in bulk because they go through so many, but these wipes are softer and less abrasive than others we've tried. The only thing thatt I'd say I don't like is that they don't come apart very easily; the wipes tend to stick together when I'm trying to get them apart with one hand. But otherwise a great product!"	&&&
These are my favorite wipes. The natural care wipes are a little rough, but these have a smooth texture. They are also thinner than the Pampers wipes which I think gets the baby cleaner. The only complaint is that sometimes they tear when you pull them out of the container but again, sometimes. My daughter also has sensitive skin and these wipes are gentle on her.	&&&
Love these softer, finer wipes for young babies and the other thicker wipes for older babies.	&&&
I love these. Very gentle with no chemicals. My only issue is they don't always pull out out easily.	&&&
Made my face burn!! I was raving about how good it smelled and then 30 sec later, ohhhh, my face started burning! I don't have sensitive skin either. The burn did stop though as soon as I rinsed my skin with water. I can't use this product.	&&&
Best wipes out there. Great for sensitive skin, unscented, and work well to wipe up anything.	&&&
Only wipes we use. We find them to be good and "wet", I like to have some moisture on my wipes to help get at poop residue on kids bottoms. A friend prefers the "drier" Huggies wipes and says these are too "wet". I will say we pat our kids bottoms dry with a tissue after using these wipes but I prefer this to the possibility of leaving anything behind. Pleasant scent, not too strong. Wipes are touch and your fingers will not break through. EXCELLENT price on Subscribe and Save/Amazon Mom, at least $2 cheaper than at Walmart for same box, sometimes more depending on price changes/coupons on Amazon.	&&&
My daughter is prone to diaper rash and other wipes we have tried only seemed to contribute to making her skin more red and sore. The Pampers Sensitive wipes were the only wipes that were gentle enough to use without irritation. She has been rash-free since we made the switch!	&&&
As a first time mommy I wasn sure what kind of wipes I should use. I wanted wipes that were gentle and didn't irritate my baby's bottom. Pampers Sensitive wipes are just that! They're soft, gentle, and have no harsh smell. The refills are also easy to pop into existing Pampers wipes container. I would definitely recommend this product for all mommies and daddies!	&&&
I bought 2 of these after using the free Huggies hard cases that come free with the diapers. It was always such a pain to access wipes especially since I kept diapers and the wipes in a fabric case. These are the perfect solution because it's compact. I keep one in the diaper case and the other floating around the diaper bag to get to easily. Wipes stay moist!	&&&
I just love this Huggies gift package it also has a wipe pouch that is pretty it can be used for a boy or girl it's soft & durable very convenient I've put it right in my grand son's diaper bag	&&&
These wipes are softer than the average wipe. The solid flip top is nice & snaps closed so you know the rest of the wipes won't dry out. However, while using them there is a slight sticky feeling on my hands that lingers until the moisture from the wipe dries. Almost like lotion that isn't completely rubbed in.	&&&
"Okay, so I'm usually a buyer of Pampers wipes, but considering the price cut that was going on I decided to get Members Mark for fourteen dollars (for a thousand wipes!).
I love the hardware that is on the wipes! I was shocked at how great quality they are. Plus the opening for the wipes is small so when I pull for a wipe, I pull out one wipe at a time not 3 or 4 like I do with other wipes.
Also, I get more waste cleaned with one wipe than I do with three pampers wipes. I was absolutely shocked. Also, there is no overwhelming scent which was just a bonus for me. I just needed a cheap wipe that worked well and this passed my standards by far.
As long as they continue working this well and don't change their product, I will continue to buy.
Great product overall."	&&&
I bought these cases when I realized that my diaper bag was unnecessarily heavy because I had a huge package of wipes in there. These had the best reviews and the wipes do not dry out. I've had wipes stay moist for weeks, months even. I've never had them dry out using the ButiPod, I've just used them all and needed to refill! We buy the bulk wipes through Amazon Mom and use them to fill our wipes containers at home as well as the ButiPod. I've started getting these for every new mom I know as a gift. They are that good!	&&&
Wonderful quality wipes, doesn't leave streaks.	&&&
We have two of these and they both work great. I've been using this multiple times a day for over a year and it still is functional. I love that the wipes are so easy to access and have had no problems getting this to work. Great product!	&&&
absolutely love this wipe dispenser. ended up buying a second one and I am thinking seriously of buying a third one for different type of wipes. it keeps wet wipes moist much better than the package in which they arrive. I like the fact that it has a weight to keep them down and be able to take one wipe at a time. it's also good for dry wipes, again easy to use.	&&&
This wipes are perfect and super gentle for mi babies sensitive skin.	&&&
What can I say? They're wipes. They do the job and depending on how often you use wipes, these do last a long time. I ordered these exact ones twice so far and will be purchasing a third time soon!	&&&
These wipes are awesome. My husband uses these after he picks up LO from daycare and wipes her down. Also great when your out and about and need to keep LO clean.	&&&
These wipes smell great and are very soft. I have basically used these wipes since my child's birth.	&&&
Love these wipes would recommend these wipes to anyone. very happy with them.	&&&
I've loved these wipes since discovering them when my son was two weeks old (he's now one). My husband complains that the wipes are way too thin (think wet paper towel WITHOUT the breakage factor - somewhat elastic), but I love that about them; I'm able to clean all around his delicate parts and get in and out of every crevice whereas the thicker wipes seem like they are much harder to get to reach all the icky "crumbs" leftover.	&&&
When using these wipes I am reassured that they will not irritate my son since they have no scent. They r also a good size so I don't have to use so many	&&&
baby wipes can be natural, clean, fresh, and safe!!! these are great!! I will order again, recommend, and use for years! I have been looking for the purest, safest items for the baby, and I am thrilled with these - I think they are a great hand wipe for travel as well, and so much better than the chemical filled option	&&&
Love these Windex wipes. I keep a pack in my car for touch-ups on windshield, inside and out. I don't use them so terribly often as to be a burde on the environment but find them very handy. And difficult to find now, except for her on Amazon!! Go, Amazon. You're the greatest!	&&&
I bought this because my method of using zip locks quickly dried out the wipes. This fits in my purse and it is easy to open and keeps the wipes wet for a very long period of time.	&&&
"I am expecting a baby and so excited to used these organic bamboo washcloths! This is far from my first baby and I know what I am looking for in fabrics these days. I learned long ago that bamboo is one of the best, softest, and most absorbent fabrics for baby out there. Unlike other natural fabrics, this one doesn't tend to get covered in chemicals and I love that! I knew when I saw these that they would be one of the first things I got for baby who is due in August. I am also of course getting bamboo cloth diapers too! Did I mention I love bamboo fabric? All 6 of these wipes are in perfect condition, as one would expect for this price. I love the soft colors and think they would make a great baby shower gift. Too often baby washcloths are too small and they get annoying. Not these ones though! I am so thrilled with them. No icky scent when opening and they are already really soft and I know with washing that they will be even more so.

Disclaimer: I received this item without charge to facilitate my honest opinion."	&&&
"These organic bamboo washcloths are unbelievably soft. After washing and drying they are remarkably even softer. I was pleasantly surprised by the larger size considering most baby washcloths are smaller than my hand. A soft washcloth makes cleaning dirty little faces a lot easier! Our babies are precious. We want the best for them. I think you'll be thoroughly pleased with this product.

The natural colors are perfect for boys or girls. Brooklyn Bamboo baby washcloths are made well and will make a really nice gift for baby showers!

Disclosure: I received this product for a free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."	&&&
I take these wipes on the go. They are easy to use and put away. Works great! I use a lot of wipes to clean everything and they get the job done. I like that they are a good size to use when your are out and about. They are thin wipes but a little long.	&&&
I recorded this product at a discount for an honest review... When I purchased these I was under the impression it was for make up removal Where it states it's exfoliating wipes that can be used as a make up remover.. My wipes happened to be dried out I had to rinse them in water to moisten I preferred NOT to use the wipe near my eyes the material is to rough for my likings I wasn't very impressed again I was under the impression this was to remove make up	&&&
A year ago I purchased Josie Maran Bear Naked Nail Wipes. I loved them! However, after the summer, I stopped wearing nail polish and concentrated on strengthening my nails with TIPS. This past week I was going to a training class and decided to polish my nails. Tonight I had to remove my polish and grabbed the Bear Naked wipes. I figured they would probably be dried out since I purchased them thirteen months ago. When I opened them up, they were just as moist as they were the day I opened the container!! My nail polish came off in a snap, and my nails look so hydrated! Don't ever stop making these!!	&&&
We have used these wipes for adult care, and have had no problems with them.	&&&
We the wipes everywhere we go because we can use them for multiple uses and they are really dependable in cleaning.	&&&
Works great	&&&
These Pampers wipes are super soft and are moist, unlike Huggies wipes. Would recommend!	&&&
Great way to buy for best price! I didn't know you could buy these refills until I saw them here on Amazon. I have always bought them in the plastic container which I have repurposed many of them. Since I don't need the container any more and only need one for the refills, this is a good way to purchase the refills. Never have they been irritating and the light scent is just right-----not to much but just enough. These packages stay moist until the very last one. The seller does everything the way it should be done. This is the only way I will by Always Wipes.	&&&
Use these wipes as you're putting your gear away at the range. Good for hands & face. There's lots of liquid on these wipes!	&&&
These are so soft! So much better than the ones you typically find.	&&&
It would be perfect if it's a bit thicker.	&&&
Great wipes. Basically all I used on my now 8 month old with no rashes. Not too wet, unscented and tear easily. Buying my second box	&&&
"This has got to be one of my favorite purchases for our first baby. It's extremely easy to know when to refill because of the little window and the wipes consistently come out one at a time without fail. We used those self-dispensing soft packs downstairs, but it was always so frustrating trying to pull out only one wipe at a time with a squirmy baby, especially if he's extremely dirty. I use Seventh Generation wipes and they are always moist. I can fit about two packs inside. I love that I can pull wipes single handed or even close the lid with an elbow if my hands have gotten a little messy. We loved this dispenser so much that we have three of them: one for upstairs, one for downstairs, and one for daycare.

Pros:
- Window easily lets you know when to refill
- Simple one-click lid makes it easy to open or close when hands are dirty
- Tight lid keeps wipes moist indefinitely
- Sturdy construction (I've dropped it several times and it still works like new)
- Weighted insert consistently keeps wipes coming up only one at a time
- Clean look with just the right amount of color accents

Cons:
- Do not like the glue used on the packaging sticker. Frustrating trying to get little bits of stubborn glue off.
- Relatively heavy. This is not something that can easily be toted up and down the stairs. That's why we bought two for home!"	&&&
They help keep the wipes moist, but don't last as long as the package says.	&&&
I wanted to love these because I'm a huge fan of Yes to... brand, and facial wipes... but these were so rough that I demoted them to being post-workout sweaty body wipes... and use nicer ones for my face.	&&&
I've been using these wipes since my kids were born, but this new formula is awful. The wipes are small, thin and dry. Inexplicably, they stick to my baby's skin while at the same time slipping over the mess I'm trying to wipe. It now takes double the number of wipes to clean up after a poopy diaper. I love Seventh Generation, but sadly I am now searching for a new brand of wipes. On a positive note, I do like the new flip-top dispenser.	&&&
I don't recommend these wipes and won't be buying them again. They aren't strong at all and rip apart very easily such as when I pull them out of the dispenser, when I'm wiping my daughter's bottom and basically when I'm wiping almost anything (her nose, face, etc.).	&&&
Gets little bottoms very clean Nice moist wipes I purchase these all the time.	&&&
Am a Smiley360 member and used this product. Loved the difference between these for women and the ones for anyone to use. Felt softer and made me feel more comfortable.	&&&
I love these wipes! It is difficult to find wipes that are both flushable AND do not contain many of the harsh chemical additives most other popular brands contain. These are gentle on the skin, the sheets are fairly large in size, and for a pack of six, they're a great bargain! I'm a new fan of LadyGroomer!"}	&&&
I use these wipes to clean quickly especially the baths and kitchens in our home. Love the scent!!!! I wish all cleaning was this easy...	&&&
these are dry wipes , they work ok	&&&
Germ-X is by far the best antibacterial wipes available, and Sam's price is the best. The wipes are not skimpy in size or content.	&&&
Huggies Natural Care Wipes cleanse very good and it's very gentle compares to Pampers brand. Love Huggies Natural Wipes and would recommend it to my friends.	&&&
Favorite wipes EVER! I love that they smell so fresh, which is always a plus when it comes toweling baby bottoms.	&&&
This is the perfect size, strength, and price. It is convenient and effective. I have tried the 'survival' body wash towels, but they are more than six times the cost. The dispensable towlette wipes are useless and smell bad. These are just right, And the fact that the package reseals after each towel is used makes it one of the most useful male hygiene products available. A road warrior would never have to shower -- just a hair wash in a sink every few days, and you're good. My daughter uses them now after horseback riding, where there's nothing but a hose to clean with.	&&&
LOVELOVELOVE these wipes! Fast, easy to use, and gentle to 67 year old skin. What else could you ask for?	&&&
This warmer does what it says it does. I decided to buy this because my little guy (5 weeks old) hated the cold wipes. The problem is that the wipes pull apart as you try to take them out of the warmer. So everytime I need a wipe I'd have to open the holder up.	&&&
The individual packages are extremely difficult to open; sometimes I have to resort to scissors to open one. After opening, the wipes do a reasonably good job. I wish the wipes were a bit softer; after they dry they are stiff and paper-like. This makes me wonder why they are called "cloths".	&&&
Seems they have downsized big time!! The wipes are so small and thin. Not worth the price either if you must use more to compensate for the smaller sheet size!!	&&&
Wipes, they work!! We only use pampers.	&&&
These wipes are great, remove all makeup from foundation to eye liner. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn't dry my skin out or cause any problems.	&&&
This product made our life much easier! The wipes we use are very natural and don't have a lot of additives, and so they are hard to take out of their package. I am so happy I got this wipes dispenser- it works great. I love that you press on the lead for it to open and that there is a heavy cover on the wipes that avoid them from sticking to each other. I don't know if all wipes dispensers work similarly, I only tried this one, but I am very happy with it!	&&&
I received a samples of these for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I love the quality of these wipes. They work so well. They are thicker than other wipes, and it takes less wipes to clean up a mess!	&&&
These are the best lens wipes I can find...and I bought them at a bargain here on Amazon!	&&&
These are really great wipes. They are gentle and eco friendly. They are not overly wet or too dry- a very happy medium. I discovered this brand right before I had my baby and I'm so glad I did. I highly recommend.	&&&
Life saver...total life saver. We used these for the the first few months after several other brands caused so many problems. After a couple months our little cutie's butt had achieved the structural fortitude to deal with regular wipes but I'm so glad we found these when we did.	&&&
Awesome lens wipes. Individual packaging is awesome, convenient and keeps the wipes moist and sanitary. They aren't overly wet and anything you clean will dry on its own and be perfectly clean. They work great so far for camera lenses, computer, tablet, and phone screens, and my sunglasses. The price is very affordable as long as you don't get what your cleaning, dirty every few minutes.	&&&
i can always count on huggies soft skin wipes to leave my childs skin so soft.	&&&
I've been using Pampers Natural Clean wipes since day one. Originally purchased for the hypo-allergenic quality, I also love how strong the wipes are. Big messes are cleaned quickly without using a ton of wipes.	&&&
They work great on kitchen surfaces	&&&
We used Pampers Sensitive Baby Wipes on our newborn and loved them. They don't have much of a scent, which is fine by me. They never irritate the baby's skin. They are soft and gentle, like all things Pampers, and durable enough to get the job done. Would recommend to anyone.	&&&
I love OXO's wipes dispenser cases for the baby's room and was excited to try this item but it left me very disappointed. The button to open the thing is hard to press and the case doesn't seal well, so my wipes kept drying out. I don't use my diaper bag frequently so every time I'd need wipes they'd be dry and useless.	&&&
These makeup wipes smell almost exactly like gojo soap. It's a very citrus and vanilla scent, which is nice to smell as you're wiping your face. This removes all of my makeup except a little bit of waterproof mascara. The wipes themselves seem a little less wet than the standard wipes from other brands so I'm always afraid I'm going to dry it up before I'm done using it, but it always gets the job done! I also have very acne prone skin and after about 4-5 days of use every night before bed it hasn't broke me out, which is awesome.	&&&
Economical, gets the job done. Not the softest wipe out there but they don't irritate	&&&
Love these wipes! My daughter went thru a period of time where all mainstream diaper wipes irritated her super sensitive skin -- but these worked wonders -- thick and soft and non-shredding....and perfect for sensitive skin!	&&&
After I had my son I suffered from hemorrhoids, but was too embarrassed to carry anything with me when I left the house. When I got these samples in the mail I fell in love because I could take them with me and not feel that embarrassment. I would definitely recommend them to everyone.	&&&
Leaves you refreshingly clean.	&&&
We have cats and dogs. This product is a must have and is used very often.	&&&
Best wipes ever! Feels much better than toilet paper, that's for sure. And the packaging is perfect enough to carry in your back pocket on the way to do your duties in the workplace.	&&&
I like these wipes because they are not ridiculously thick and saturated with slimy soap like most other brands I've tried.	&&&
It's a pain having to disassemble and clean my face mask daily, so I decided to try these wipes instead. I gotta say, it's quite convenient and just as good as my warm water and dish soap method from before. The price isn't horrible for the convenience because I always forget to grab my mask on my way to bed so I have to get up and retrieve it from the kitchen after I'm warm in bed! So, for me it is good!	&&&
Nice wipes, soft and moist, easy to wipe.	&&&
used them the last couple of days. They are thick and the container the refils fit into is easy to get the wipes out of when you need them quickly. Impressed!	&&&
This OXO good grips flushable wipes container is awesome. It is much easier to use than the "disposable" Cottonelle or Charmin dispensers. It has a spring loaded top and a nice weight to it. The wipes come out one at a time and you never have to "restart" the pile. The next one always comes up no problem.	&&&
I love the Pampers sensitive wipes. They do not bother my sons skin. They are thick and I have never had one break while cleaning up my son. Very rarely do I need to use more than 1 wipe when cleaning up a messy diaper.	&&&
Wipes are great, but the packs are for refilling a box and I did not realize that when purchasing. Great price though!!	&&&
I've been using wipes since 4 years for my kids and has always used pampers. Being an Amazon fanatic, I thought of giving these wipes a try... I personally didn't like them at all.. wipes are not moist enough and so I have to use 2 or 3 in place of the 1 pamper wipe. Just tried them for the sake of it... not going to buy them again... not worth....	&&&
Much too "wet"...my mat doesn't dry quickly enough, especially using at the gym.	&&&
These wipes are must have, especially for pet owners, but my puppy keep chewing it which drives me crazy I have to stick my hand in his mouth trying to take it.	&&&
When I ordered these I was expecting some thin cheapie wipes. I was so shocked when we used them for the first time and they are nice and thick, smell good and get my baby's booty clean. I have a pack in my car, bedroom, kitchen, and living room!	&&&
perfect after a messy food session! use them all the time just wish they were slightly cheaper! Also they dont pull out very easily a lot of the time id end up pulling out half the wipes	&&&
I tried several different wipes. My son has very sensitive skin and actually got a chemical burn from some wipes. These however are the only ones that did not do that to his poor little tushie. Very happy with these wipes. The Honest Company wipes even gave him a chemical burn, just FYI.	&&&
These wipes are awesome.!! They take off my makeup with one wipe,even my eye makeup and leave my skin feeling soft, not drying at all. Love them!	&&&
These are out favorite. Little one struggle with SEVERE diaper rash until about 4/5 months old. These were the only wipes that we could find that genuinely seemed to have nothing "extra" in them. All of the other natural and organic wipes we bought were too expensive and seemed dry. These wipes seem very moist and don't have an smell. We love them.	&&&
Very soft, durable. Great for facial use	&&&
I was happy with these wipes. Size wise, they are very close to the Huggies Natural Care wipes and just as thick. I found they clean poop off well. I love the 'fresh" scent, it smells like a cucumber scent.	&&&
Best Wipes I can find	&&&
These wipes are great. They aren't thick, think Costco brand wipes if you've ever used those. No complaints about moisture. The only complaint I have is the scent. They are too strong for my family. We usually get unscented wipes but decided to try these out instead. It's reminiscent of hand soap and really strong. Love Amazon products. I will definitely be buying these again, but unscented next time.	&&&
These are the softest Baby Washcloths on the market. My daughter has sensitive skin so I always hating rubbing harsh washcloths against her skin. Now with the help of these Bamboo Baby Washcloths I can latter them up with her body wash and clean her entire body without her clinching. These washcloths are amazing and have been used by my 18 month old, my 4 year old, my 5 year old as well as my husband and myself. I'll never go back to a regular washcloth for my family again! These are simply amazing and make the most perfect gift as well.	&&&
"I have seen a number of critical reviews here about smearing and residue. These make no sense unless the users did not understand the basics of lens cleaning. I have tried many brands of these and compared them to the control of using hot water and detergent followed by a gentle blot-dry.
For example, Costco brand which only contains isopropyl alcohol and detergent leave a messy wet residue with fibers. Completely unusable.

These Zeiss wipes are without question the best available and I can say unequivocally that when used properly they leave no film - only a crystal clear result. I have been in the lens, microscopy and eyeglasses world for a lifetime. I wouldn't offer this review if I wasn't sure of the results."	&&&
"I'm a spoon collector; I collect spoons that are meant to only be displayed to represent a past time or travel in my life. Recently I had gone through my collection and noticed some of the silver was becoming tarnished. I decided it was time to get some polish and clean them up.

When I first read into this product I was skeptical on how well it worked. I also was afraid it would be too small of an amount, but previous customer reviews convinced me that it could potentially work. So i went with my gut and I just bought it. I got it with prime so naturally it was here in two days and I used it immediately.

I give this product 5 stars for multiple reasons. Firstly, the container, though looks small, contains a tons of polishing wipes inside. Also, as you'll see on my before and after pictures that this product worked it's magic! I was impressed and completely satisfied with this product and the results it gives. I polished about 20 spoons and only had to use maybe 5 wipes total. The only thing I would note is that it does take a little time to get the tarnish off so you might have to ""scrub"" a little more and have some patience. But other than that, I would recommend this product to everyone! Thank you Weiman Products, LLC!"	&&&
"Wish they would eliminate the ingredients that give everyone a rash. The worst is MI (methylisothiazolinone). I love this product and used it for years then began getting a rash from it. Cottonelle actually has less of the bad stuff than baby wipes. But I could not give them up and now just use them sometimes.
The building I live in has banned the flushing of all wipes. Cottonelle insists that they are ""flushable"" but they do not dissolve fast enough and clog up most sewer systems. The February 2015 NY Magazine has a big article (Public Enemy no.2) about how bad this has gotten just about everywhere. There may soon be laws to remove the word ""flushable"".
In the meantime, if you can't give them up, just throw them in the trash. Don't flush them."	&&&
These are such great facial wipes! They don'tleave that gross rresidue on your face like other wipes do. They don't dry put my face either! If I'm feeling too lazy to wash my face at night I can just use one of these and I'm good to go.	&&&
"Well, this is going to hurt my considerable street cred. Nothing says ""bad @$%"" like a five star, excited review for triple action dust wipes. But these are AWESOME! Among my many manly qualities lurks a particularly manly species of obsessive compulsive disorder, which, to the consternation of my wife, will result in me stepping over mounds of laundry and half eaten plates of food to dust our TV, or piano, or computer. The inside of my car? An operating room. The living room? Mayhem. With most things I'm pretty slovenly. But if it's electronic or moves, I'm like Martha Stewart after a cocaine binge.

What's so good about these? They are impregnated with something that makes them dust magnets. Not sure what it is, but there is a very subtle tackiness to these such that they just grab dust, and don't spread it around not matter how much you dust something. I tried them on a really dusty table in the attic, and the wipe came away dark with dust, but the table was perfectly clean.

Keep in mind, though, that these are ONLY good for dusting. Because of the stuff in them, these probably won't absorb liquid very well, and aren't useful for general cleaning."	&&&
My mother loves these wipes she used them love the smell they in every other room in our house...	&&&
My favorite scent in wipes. I use these to take my makeup off as well!	&&&
Love the convenience of these wipes. Good for a quick clean up/wipe down.	&&&
We started with the Pampers Sensitive wipes then switched to these. They work just as well, have more in the package, and have a light fragrance.	&&&
These wipes work great for our twins and we have used them for over two years. They smell nice without being overpowering and we have never had them react negatively to our kids' skin. The refills work great with our Pampers tub and we just have to use a scissors to cut a hole in the top when we open a new package. These also clean up various messes around the house. They are a great product and we would recommend them to anyone!	&&&
"I wanted something for baby wipes because I think those small packages are a waste of money. These zipper pouches are perfect. The wipes stay nice and moist. (All the other containers I've tried dry the wipes out.)
It also fits perfectly in my JJ Cole diaper clutch."	&&&
No surprises with this product. Works good in the wild	&&&
The smell is good and it does what its supposed to do. It isn't as thick as original baby wipes but, again, work well.	&&&
I love these because they don't have an offensive odor like other brands and they are small enough to fit in a pocket.	&&&
I love huggies wipes! They are the only wipes I use now with my little girl! Other wipes caused my youngest to break out in rashes. These work great! Thank you huggies!	&&&
I love Huggies baby wipes! They are just simply the best! I tried other brands, but non of them as good as Huggies. Very durable and thick. Recommend to everyone!	&&&
These were a bit smaller than expected. However, they are perfect for carrying in purse or car. Excellent price!	&&&
I'm a huge fan of a lot of Josie's products, but not a fan of her cleansers until now. This is my one and only cleansing system AND doubles as my exfoliator. My skin is now softer and smoother than ever and CLEARER too! Clearer, softer, treated skin = less make up. :) One wipe does the trick and no irritation on my sensiive skin or eyes (contacts). If you have a ton of bullet proof make up you might need two wipes, but all my make up is Josie's line so it comes off easily. Only critique is the packaging. I'm about halfway through my pack and the seal doesn't seal super tight anymore, but I just keep it turned over and that seems to keep them moist.	&&&
"We received many different types and brands of baby wipes at our baby shower, but we ended up truly appreciating the Huggies Pop-Up Wipes Tub.

The 64 wipes in the package were large, soft, worked well, didn't have any offensive odor, and they did not cause any issues with our son's sensitive skin. But, what we were really impressed with was the case. The lid opens with the push of a single button and the rubbery mouth does a good job of separating the wipes. And most importantly, the wipes do not dry up while inside the tub (meaning that the Lid closes securely enough to keep out air).

I grew up in Seattle and so I'm overly pumped about recycling. And this tub has been re-used over and over for the past 6 months.
What is great is that the Kirkland Brand wipes from Costco fit inside even though there are 100 wipes per bag (instead of the 64 that come in the Huggies package). Simply twist off the plastic top to the Kirkland wipes and they fit right inside. (Example is in the pictures attached.)

For such a low price these wipes are absolutely worth giving a shot. And if you find cheaper wipes that you prefer, you can still use the box over and over. It really makes grabbing wipes a one handed operation."	&&&
These are great towelettes for the price. I used these everyday to remove my makeup. They get the job done, but I think they are just a little bit harsh on my skin. Nothing some moisturizer can't handle!	&&&
I use these ALL the time and I love them. They have a good scent that's not to much and clean well.	&&&
Very good wipes. I've used these for years, and haven't found any I like better.	&&&
Item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly	&&&
These are great wipes, and they come in a huge quantity. I have sensitive skin and while I love the scented face wipes, sometimes they burn a little. These don't burn as much and are unscented. They're a big size and not really something you can drop in your purse (I get that they're really baby wipes). I keep them in my car and they do well maintaining a seal and staying damp.	&&&
Supposed to be unscented, but I think whatever that lotion with aloe is must be smelly in its own right. Even the box, which I tried to re-use, has a perfume-y residue.	&&&
"I was fortunate enough to get to sample this wonderful product for free, this opinion is my own!
I am a HUGE fan! These are amazing, on the go, packets of soothing comfort! It takes a lot to impress me regarding this touchy subject but this is very impressive!"	&&&
I will be returning to work soon and so happy I found these. I will not always have the opportunity or access to be able to clean my equipment at work so I plan to use these instead.	&&&
I buy the Sensitive wipes for my son because he has excema and breaks out easily. Pampers Sensitive wipes not only clean his diaper messes extremely well (I only have to use a few wipes instead of like 20 generic wipes) but I also keep Pampers wipes in my vehicle and kitchen! I use them to wipe up messes, wash my son's hands and mouth, clean his feet, dust the vehicle, wipe out booster seats at restaurants, wipe up small messes on the countertop, clean up handprints off my stainless steel fridge, and a million of other uses! These wipes do it all, are soft and gentle and well worth the price! You'll find you can't live without them. I can't!	&&&
Again, home dialysis. All work surfaces must be kept clean and germ free as much as possible. I depend on these to assist in the wipe down.	&&&
Best Wipes, ever.	&&&
Love these wipes! I preferre them over Lysol wipes. They are strong, durable and have a nice smell!	&&&
our dog had a medical event that temporarily paralyzed her; and she had urine leakage almost constantly. These wipes were so gentle, non-toxic, fragrance free, and good for her skin. This was a big part of her recovery! Along with Absorbz pads.	&&&
These wipes are better than any other expensive brands on the market!	&&&
These are the best unscented wipes I have used. I have tried many natural brands and Huggies came out on top. Good value, very soft, wipes do not stick together. Highly recommend.	&&&
works efficiently	&&&
"I like this thing, but it definitely could've been designed a little bit better.

First of all, I use this and don't have a baby. I like to have wipes handy to wash my face with in the morning, or other random beauty uses. It's something my mom always did, and I picked up the habit from her. So I'd really like OXO to make an option to just get an all-white one of these, but neither color choice fit with the decor of my bathroom or vanity area.

But my biggest problem with it is that it doesn't keep the wipes moist enough! If you have a baby and use this all the time, it'll work perfectly. But for somebody like me who occasionally goes a day or two without opening it, I'll often have to throw the top one away because it's become dry.

I do love that you can use this thing with one hand, though, and I like that it looks better in my bathroom than one of those plastic cases they originally come in.

So, bottom line, this is an excellent product for parents, but if you're not using it for diaper changing, it does have some design flaws."	&&&
Love these wipes :) only wipes I've used so far	&&&
Quick clean for my sinks and counters at home and school. It leaves my faucets sparkling. I absolutely love these!	&&&
I was told at the counter that these removed waterproof mascara. They do not at all. I was very disappointed in this product.	&&&
since they have made these wipes thicker, they are wonderful!!	&&&
These baby wipes are amazing! I thought they would be smaller, but they're huge! They are the size of a washcloth. They are super soft and gentle on my daughters skin. The price is also great for 100% bamboo. This will make cloth diapering so much easier. I'll definitely be ordering more.	&&&
Look good. Just received them and have not tried one yet.	&&&
I have no problem with this wipes it is thick and one sheet can clean up a messed like any liquid spill. We ran through a lots of wipes combining with my son and my mother in-law that used 24 hour incontenence.We usually used around at least 350-500 counts for a week on the different brand but with this Seventh Greneration brand it lasts as more than a week of consume, it supplied as for almost 2 weeks between my son and my monther in-law.One thing that i like with this brand is very very gentle for my son skin, except the price i think it's a bit higher for this counts of wipes.	&&&
These wipes are alcohol based. Each wipe is in an envelope. Contrary to another review I read, I have plenty of time to clean my glasses before the alcohol evaporates. The wipes came in a shrink wrapped baggie rather than the box. This is perfectly acceptable to me but some other folks might prefer the box. While I did not actually count them, it looked to me like I got 200 wipes as agreed. They do a great job of cleaning eye glasses. They may be too small for cleaning larger objects. This product is intended for eye glasses and it works great with them.	&&&
Only wipes I use!	&&&
these wipes are fine, they get the job done for being non-alcoholic so gentle on baby's butt. Only real complaint is that they are not packaged to easily pull out of the package. They all get stuck together so I often pull a few wipes out accidentally. It's like they're packaged incorrectly or something.	&&&
I use these when I can't wash my hands. I keep them in the car. Great for keeping away those germs.	&&&
Horror of horrors. Bleeding, cracking skin and severing itching in the worst of places. Definately a reaction to these- stopped using and all cleared up. Kept me wondering if it was something else for awhile which was scary (STDs?, etc) until I read other reviews confirming the allergic reaction. Don't bother with these- use a towel and some water.	&&&
These are the only type of wipes I buy for my daughter. They are great quality and are thick compared to other wipes.	&&&
Easy to use plastic dispenser. Keeps wipes remain moist.	&&&
These are great wipes- they are gentle on the skin but tough on the mess! These wipes are different than the other pampers wipes by the Baby Fresh scent- which is really just a glorified way of saying baby powder. I dislike the scent but I am not a fan of baby powder anyways. I would recommend getting these wipes if scents don't bother you or you like baby powder scent. Sometimes I buy these because they are cheaper than other pampers wipes- they feel the same and do the same job as the other wipes. Only difference I found was the smell.	&&&
Hate is such a strong word, but I wanted to give these 1 star because that is what I felt they deserved. They are useless to me. I can't get deep in crevices of the ear enough. I just use diluted vinegar and cotton balls now. If there's a particular spot of goo that I can't get to, I GENTLY and CAREFULLY use a cotton swab.	&&&
Love these wipes. Removes the makeup completely. No residue, no burning feel lile yes to wipes. These wipes are great for skin. Leaves me fave soft and smooth after removing makeup.	&&&
These things are amazing. I run on my lunch break, and they freshen me up nicely without any weird scent or stickiness.	&&&
"Only reason I'm not giving these wipes 5 stars is because it's not wet enough. However, when I use it to clean my face without makeup, it works great. I was impressed on how Fresh and clean my face felt after. No other wipes I've used gave me that feeling. Trust me, I've tried many different brands.
As for using it to remove makeup, I'm not a big fan since it's not wet enough.
Maybe the manufacturer can read this (and other reviews) and add more ""liquid"" to moisten it more. Maybe then, it'll earn 5 stars!"	&&&
Great anti fog wipes for the Oculus Rift Gear VR.	&&&
These wipes are so gentle for my face. Since I have sensitive skin, I am careful what I use and this is the answer for me. I also love the fact that Josie Maran products are natural and safe. I'll repurchase again!	&&&
These amazingly soft bamboo baby washcloths are just the right size, and texture to be able to use on soft, delicate skin. I never know that bamboo was twice as soft as cotton, but I learned that quickly after feeling how soft they are. The beautiful green, yellow, and light blues make them perfect for boys or girls. Love how soft and durable they are. Just throw them in the washer with your other stuff, and they will clean up nice and still be super fluffy and soft. I only like using the best when it comes to my nine month old niece, and these are defiantly top of the line. Will defiantly buy again! Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above either free or discounted for my honest review. My opinions have not been influenced by monetary compensation.	&&&
The wipes are so small it's almost impractical. I prefer the sani-kids. It also leaves behind cotton threads on my hands.	&&&
Really good for those nights that you're lazy because your makeup comes off immediately with these wipes. The only thing that bothers me very minimally is that it leaves my face feeling kind of sticky after use, but at the same time, that's okay because I wash my face afterwards anyways.	&&&
I seen these were cheap and I wanted to try new wipes. I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all but these caused me to break out so bad and left my face in pain. The product said there was cucumbers so it would sooth skin and theyre supposedly clarifying wipes. However, in my case it was the opposite.	&&&
At first I was skeptical thinking these are just baby wipes with saline in smart packaging but I was wrong. After this past winter of having my children cycle through multiple colds with runny noses, I now appreciate the Boogie Wipe and their purpose. The wipes themselves are very, very soft. Although the package says simply unscented, there is a very mild clean smell. The wipes are slightly smaller than a regular sized tissue but definitely much softer. It makes cleaning a runny nose much easier. Where once I would never consider purchasing this product, it is now one of our subscribe and save items! Highly recommend!!!	&&&
"These Brooklyn Bamboo Baby Washcloths are amazing. When these arrived I did not expect anything special. A washcloth is a washcloth right? Nope… that is not the case with these guys. The washcloths are rolled up individually and secured with a polka-dot bow. When I took them out of the package the first thing I noticed was how soft they are! It was a nice surprise. The washcloths are also a lot bigger than I expected. After running them through the wash, they came out of the dryer even softer then when they arrived. They did not shrink either. Using these washcloths during bath time made cleaning my baby so much easier. Between the soft material and the size, they are absolutely perfect. I think these would make a great re-usable wipe for all of those babies with extra sensitive skin.

I went ahead and picked up some to use as a baby shower gift. I placed them in a cute container and added a bow. That way the new parents to be will have a cute and organized spot to keep baby’s wash cloths.

Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. All of my opinions are 100% my own and were gained through my own experiences with this product."	&&&
"I was not happy with these wipes and plan on returning them. I used only two of the wipes on my white erase board and on my calendar white erase, but they did not wipe off anything. They are extra wet, but still did not work."	&&&
I love how gentle they are on babies skin. They're not rough like huggies wipes.	&&&
These are hands-down the best stainless steel cleaner/polisher I've tried. These are easy to use. Simply pull out a wipe, clean stainless surface and then polish with a dry cloth. These do a fantastic job cleaning without much scrubbing. The polishing is simple and rarely leaves any streaks. One wipe will often do my very dirty fridge and dishwasher. I also love their leather wipes.	&&&
These wipes are very nice. Lovely, fresh cucumber scent, and a nice ribbed texture and thickness. Having twins, good, yet affordable baby wipes are a must!	&&&
I travel to this world countries and never leave without Wet Ones. Not only third world countries but everywhere I go. I am sure it has kept me from many illnesses. It is no fun to be ill when you are abroad. They are such a handy size as well.	&&&
"The Bamboo Baby Cloth Wipes are fantastic! First of all I love that they are made of a material that is quickly renewable. I grow bamboo and it is grows rampantly once established. I also know that bamboo is the best soft and gentle hypoallergenic fabric for a baby's delicate skin. I like that these are organic because I do not have to worry or wonder about the chemicals that might affect my granddaughters health. My daughter had sensitive skin as a baby and using baby wipes made her little butt hurt. Her first daughter also had issues with wipes and I am pretty sure the new baby will too. These are a great washable alternative. In addition to using them as wipes, she can use them as washcloths - for her and her babies - they really are large enough to work. The last thing that I thought they would be good for is using them to catch the dribbles when she is breastfeeding or burping her baby. I am sure there are lots of other uses I have not thought of.

When she opened them, she commented on how soft and thick they were. I know they are absorbent because they are made of bamboo. I recommend these for baby - and pick up a pack for yourself too! I wish I had!

Disclaimer: I received these items for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own."	&&&
There is nothing great about this product. The wipes are dry. Not good to remove makeup, not sure how I could make use of it.	&&&
"Purchased Pampers Sensitive Wipes 13x Multipack, 808 Count for $17.57 from Amazon Warehouse Deals.

We go through a lot of Wipes and prefer the Pampers brand as we use Pampers Diapers.

The only pet peeve is that they tend to get dry quickly if exposed as kiddo sometimes takes them out but they stay wet enough as long as you keep them in the box."	&&&
Caused an awful, persistent rash. NOT what you want in that area of your body. Doctors didn't know what it was for months as I tried all kinds of treatment. Finally, read an article that warns of this rash. The biocide used to keep the wipes from growing mold, attacks our skin cells. Recently, the allowed amount in the wipes was doubled. As soon as I stopped using them, the rash began to fade. Still took about 5 months to fully reside. Why would you put a chemical that causes a skin rash in baby wipes that are designed to reduce rashes !! Insane.	&&&
Work great for my son's sensative skin. Only wipes we use.	&&&
dude wipes are good and better than one wipes charles but Fresh Richie is my favorite because of how it smells and feels on me.	&&&
I don't use feminine wipes on a daily basis as my OB advised me that it's not very advisable. However, I always see to it that I have a pack handy because you'll never know when you'll need one, right? So, yup. I choose Always because I am so in l love with their tampons too! I love the smell and the fact that I can flush it down the toilet. It's so convenient. The resealable pack is a charm too!	&&&
i went through all typs of wipes as a triplet mom. this is by far the best overall	&&&
I really like these bamboo wipes. I haven't found another product out there like them. I have found other chemical-free wipes, but not any that are flushable. These are very light and thin, but strong. The reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. They are soooo expensive compared to other wipes. However, they are washable, but I would rather flush them if they're used on the backside!	&&&
I love using these types of wipes just because they do the job like any another wipes and they are less expensive!	&&&
These are the best wet wipes I have tried thus far.	&&&
These are awesome! When I started having kids I was worried about all the germs and dirt around the house. Since they basically crawl and walk around and touch and stick anything and everything they can get their tiny little hands on in their mouths. I had to figure out a easy way to keep things clean in the house! These wipes made disinfecting the entire house a breeze. I can easily wipe down the toilets, sinks, counters, tiles, etc. And with 2 giant slobbery dogs in the house you can image the amount of cleaning that one would have. I highly recommend these for sure, especially to anyone who has kids.	&&&
I love that they are scented free and hypoallergenic cuz my son had vary sensitive skin and now that im gonna have another baby Im going to use the same product cuz I love them so much...	&&&
love it; easy to use	&&&
I love the smell of the baby fresh wipes! They smell so good! They clean very well. The most wipes I have had to use at one time with pampers is two! They clean good and are thick to keep your hands clean and dry.	&&&
Worst wipes I have ever used. They dry out fast. They are small. They tear easily. They don't clean well. I had no idea wipes could be anything but just normal wipes but obviously I've been somehow spoiled by our Costco wipes. I bought these because I've always been told you should stock up any time wipes were below 2 cents a piece and there was a sale and a coupon, but, wow, bad move on my part. My husband and I both can't stand them.	&&&
These are great! They don't leave lint or cotton on your nails. They do a great job. I use them to clean off my nails just after I have applied gel nail color. Add alcohol to them, and they clean off the protective sticky coat, and shine up my nails! I love my nails to shine!	&&&
Best wipes for babies with sensitive skin. They are the perfect thickness. Unlike other brands that I have tried, these do not leave a film on the skin.	&&&
"I received these washcloths with the intent on gifting them to my sister in law who is expecting. However, once I received them I kept them for myself and had to order a new set as a gift :) . These organic washcloths are so soft and cause absolutely no irritation, whether I am using them for myself or for my 2 year old daughter. They've been through the wash a couple times now and they have washed and dried great - no change in the great quality of these organic baby washcloths. I say baby washcloths, but really this could state baby and adult washcloths. The washcloths arrived in cute packaging and I feel confident that dropping them in a gift bag and giving them as a baby shower gift would go over extremely well. I hadn't ever bought Bamboo products before, but I am glad I did this time and plan on continuing to use them and tell others about their great quality.

Disclaimer: I did receive this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own."	&&&
I love buggies wipes, they are way better than any brand out there. It would take me 3 wipes of pampers or kirkland brand wipes to do the job of one buggies wipe. Much thicker and durable for those stinky messes.	&&&
Love these wipes! They are the only ones that we will use!	&&&
These are my new favorite wipes! I've used pampers wipes for going on 3 years and I'm hooked on these. Love then and a great price! They compare closest to target wipes from my experience, but better.	&&&
Love these wipes!! My favorite by far! These are like the simply right ones Sams used to carry. Scent free and very gentle. Just thick enough and textured. Love love love these!	&&&
Easy to clean and gentle whit the baby skin. My baby never get rash with this wipes.	&&&
A little hard to melt in hot tap water unless you heat the water in microwave. Wonderful product, I used it ti make viva towel disposable wipes and it works very well. Saves lots of money. One tip I'd like to share is to melt the cube in really hot water placed in a bottle so you can shake it to dissolve quickly then pour into which ever method of wipes you use. The solution works well to remove waste from baby's bottom easily.	&&&
I use these wipes daily around the house. Like to order them when there is a coupon and I can combine with subscribe and save.	&&&
These facial cleansing wipes are great. They are strong enough to remove makeup with ease but gentle enough that my toddler is able to wash her face with them daily. They are a great size and unlike so many wipes they dont dry out fast. A huge bonus is that they dont have an overbearing smell, they have a nice light scent. The only thing that would make these better is a better package, my sealing plastic tore in half on day 3 of owning these and would no longer seal. Other than packaging these wipes are perfect.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes. They don't seem to get dried out like other ones do and you just throw the whole little package into the bigger container; so convenient.	&&&
These wipes are thick and strong, they clean up well. I wish they were a bit softer but nevertheless they are gentle and didn't irritate my son. I received a free sample of these wipes , all opinions are my own.	&&&
These things dry out before you can use them. Admittedly I didn't go through the package extremely fast, but I was trying to use some of the unwrapped wipes no more than 3 months after I bought them and they were all dried out and unusable as a sanitizer.	&&&
Nice that it's so moist. I wouldn't say one and done. Not for sensitive skin or babies with rash. Try the product on yourself.	&&&
Love these! I got them as a baby shower gift and have been hooked ever since. Would def recommend them to anyone! I use them on my 2 month old so good at any age!	&&&
"This product cleans the snot from my babies face easier then just normal wipes."	&&&
It is good since its organic and cheaper than other organic brands but particles from the wipes stays on the skin of the baby that makes it harder to remove since it sticks to the skin.	&&&
Everyone who has kids, this is a must! Especially during flu and cold seasons! I use it all over my house the door nobs the light switches that is sometimes the places that people tend to forget about! I love the smell of cleanliness while you are cleaning !	&&&
These are great, non-toxic wipes. I use them everywhere and don't have to worry about chemicals. Highly recommend.	&&&
Definitely a "go to " item!"}},	&&&
"When something is rating half and half you're really taking your chances here. About 50 5 star reviews and 50 1 star. I went ahead and ordered these and very much so regret it. Horrible that I'm stuck with them and wasted money!

First off, they smell. Not unscented at all. They have a strong weird smell unlike any other wipes I have tried.
Second, the ingredients are not so friendly Aqua, glycerin, benzyl alcohol, sodium benzoate, etc etc other reviewers have listed them all.
Third, and the one I am most angry about is they irritated my baby's skin right away!
Lastly, the wipes remind me of cheese cloth. They look like cheese cloth and feel that way, and they are small. Not durable at all and every single time I go for one 3 or 4 clump out.

Do not buy these. Just don't."	&&&
The best thing ever if you have a male dog that likes to mark...much better than the pee bands that are"washable" and it covers a larger area so you don't have to worry about it slipping out of place.	&&&
I was very skeptical when I first purchased Wiki Wags Disposable Male Dog wraps but was pleasantly surprised when my dog kept it on, and ever since the first night ( he was waking up at night and marking in our bedroom) he has not tried to get it off. I have been able to reuse them numerous times since he does not wet when the wrap is on. My husband is very happy that our carpeting is no longer getting ruined and we plan on taking the wraps with us when we go on vacation with the dog!	&&&
i am a pampers mom, thats cause i didnt like huggies and there high price, i hated the cheap pampers too, but have always gone back to pampers, after 3 kids,	&&&
Good value.	&&&
It's true what the others say, the smell is not great, but not completely awful and the wipes are very sudsy. Despite those two issues, I will keep them & use them up. Will I order again, the jury is still out....	&&&
"These are the softest, clean feeling wipes ever. I don't have to scrub my baby's bottom like I do with other brands of wipes."	&&&
These wipes are great for my skin! I have tried wipes in the past that are "for sensitive skin" and "very gentle" but these wipes work so well. It removes all of my makeup including waterproof mascara, and feels incredible on my skin. I definitely recommend this to everyone.	&&&
This is the best brand of flannel wipes in my opinion.	&&&
These are so much better than using a wipe and so much more gentle than using a tissue. We use tissues for day to day nose wiping but when little one is hit with a cold, these go into heavy rotation.	&&&
This product broke after 6 months, and I'm unable to return it to Amazon because the 30 day refund window has passed. All of a sudden one day, the motor made a strange sound and it smelled like smoke. I used it about 2-3 times a month on tile floor in my 1200 square feet condo. While cleaning, I normally start by using the vacuum setting, then the washing setting, followed by the dry setting. I would say I had typical/standard use of the product. When it worked, it was fantastic at cleaning my white floors. I just wished it lasted longer.	&&&
I keep it plugged in all the time! Wipes are always warm & moist! I've been using it for 4 months now. Baby loves it! I actually might love it more than my baby bc it's nice fort hands to not have to use a cold wipe during cold nights!!	&&&
Love it. I hate bulky heavy diaper bags so I bought this to carry pampers diaper wipes and babyganics face wipes. It holds a very reasonable amount and they stay moist. Recommend to those who want to lighten up their bag.	&&&
Soft and sturdy! Great size for baby wipes or for adult use.	&&&
Clorox has been around since I was a child and that is all I remember my parents used to wash clothes and disinfect around the house. The is the ONLY product I use in my house for the same reasons my parents did,	&&&
I really love these wipes. They don't smell bad like other wipes and they are SO thick! But a little more expensive than other brands	&&&
I' m not a baby ,but I've been using baby wipes after toilet paper for many ,many years ,I couldn't do without them .	&&&
I love the smell of these wipes. The wipes are soft and not so easy to tear.	&&&
"I enjoy using Clorox Wipes. They come in very handy in my office. I use them to disinfect my equipment and I know that the equipment is sterile for the use by my next client. They are easy to use and the container doesn't take up much space in my office. They are very easy to dispose of when I am finished with them. I like the different scents and they help adding good aroma to my office. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it. I also shared my experience with these wipes with the other members of my staff. Thank you very much."	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I have used the orange scented version in the past. The orange was not an option in Amazon Pantry. Usually I love lavender smelling products so I took a chance on this scent. It's pretty terrible and doesn't smell like lavender at all. Oh well. They clean great though. Just have to air my house out. Which kind of puts dust right back where I cleaned. Oops.	&&&
Works perfectly, the wipes never dry out and it's easy to use with one hand.	&&&
We picked up our order today so we haven't had time to use them but they are very soft and are a nice size so we should be very happy with them. jb	&&&
I have two little girls and have used nothing but these wipes since they were born. Other wipes don't compare! Plus in bulk they come with an extra case and travel pack...awesome!	&&&
So disappointed with change in these wipes - I have 4 kids - and have used these for 10 years when my oldest was a baby. The new version has a BAD smell, but more importantly, stings my kids noses now when I wipe. They cry - even my big boys - and I tried it - OUCH! Please costco - listen to your loyal customers and change it back!	&&&
I have pretty sensitive skin and I really like these wipes! Not only do they remove makeup but they remove oil without over drying. Great for travel. Would purchaseAgain.	&&&
I like having the packs. I use them for quick pick ups and daily cleaning in the bathrooms.	&&&
The sensitive wipes are great, fresh for baby and no strong smells! Soft for sensitive hineys;)	&&&
I purchase Mequiars products for my car all the time ,these wipes are just ok, the High gloss wipes are much better	&&&
While these cleansing wipes worked well, I really didn't like the smell. It is a very strong, fake coconut scent - like suntan lotion. They did remove dirt and makeup very well and didn't irrate my dry, sensitive skin, so I would buy these in an unscented version if it was available. But I would never buy this scent again.	&&&
I loved these for my sensitive skin. There are so many makeup wipes that just burn my face after one wipe but these are so soft! Yes you have to like the smell of cucumbers, so if you don't then you will have some complaints about this. I tried the Yes To... Grapefruit makeup wipes and they burned my skin but not with these ones!	&&&
Clorox wipes are my absolutely favorite cleaning cloth. I have tried other and been sadly disappointed. My shelf is stocked up with Clorox wipes for a reason!! The are awesome!	&&&
"I love huggies wipes on a regularday. To me they are normally thicker than other brands. Im not sure why but these are smaller. As other reviews have said they are smaller than the ones that normally come in the plastic refil tubs. I thought this was a great deal on them until I opened a d went to refil my tub.

They are still very durable in my opinion just maybe 20% smaller."	&&&
I am an avid fan of this product and brand. These wipes are made with high quality materials that remain to stay moist. Goodwipes are my favorite hygiene brand which I would recommend to any first time user.	&&&
Great wipes! Only use these on my daughter! Nothing else!	&&&
These wipes are wonderful. Have you every used spray and it's all over the floor, so then you need to put down towels first. Those problems are solved with these wipes. Give them a try, you will never go back to spray!	&&&
Perfect prize	&&&
never had any reactions	&&&
These are our favorite wipes. We have used them for diapering, feeding, mommy clean-up, & even spot removal when on the go. The soft fabric like material is great and non - abrasive, perfect for all skin types. "	&&&
Best addition to your baby bag. No more filling (or forgetting to fill!) those clumsy plastic travel wipes cases that only hold 10 wipes!! With these you are prepared for any mess your child might get into when out and about and my children are very good at creating messes! I have these on auto-delivery.	&&&
Im currently using these wipes as my husband accidentally bought them instead of the soft skin and i decided not to return them because they looked jut as good if not better. The smell is nice and i like that they're natural and fragrance free && hypoallergenic but they tear super easily and i feel like i have to use double the amount of wipes then normal and when its a messy diaper and you're out and about the last thing you want is your fingers tearing a hole into the wipe a s you're wiping and getting yourself all messy i usually wash my hands after changing a diaper but there isnt always a sink with running water and antibacterial soap. so after these are gone i will purchase something else.	&&&
These are really nice ! They are very very soft and feel really well on babies skin. Great for reusable wipes or for wash cloths !	&&&
These are the only wipes that don't give my son a rash! We love them!	&&&
The clasp broke after two uses so the wipes did not stay fresh. Poor quality.	&&&
I do wish they were individual packs instead of 3 large packs of 168 as I don't love the plastic tubs so I probably won't use these as a refill. I may get a small wipes case to refill to put in the diaper bag but these will be handy for at home changes. I love the thickness of these and the scent is yummy :)	&&&
These wipes never hurt our little girl's sensitive skin. Being unscented is especially nice.	&&&
Clorox is by far the best in disinfectant wipes. I like these wipes because you can use them on just about any surface, and they remove spills etc.	&&&
This broke the first week I used it. I just buy travel packs of wipes now.	&&&
I really am not too impressed with these baby wipes. I prefer the walgreens brand of baby wipes called new beginnings or huggies. These were really thin like pampers. If you think that pampers baby wipes are really good then you would really like these. I do like how much came in a pack. These packs are HUGE compared to the ones i purchase in the stores. I do like the convenience of the flip top and the soft pack over the hard box.	&&&
Strong wipes that don't fall apart when you pull them from the box. They are gentle and don't cause any irritation. These are the best wipes out there, I have used them through two babies, and anytime I have run out and used another brand I have always been disappointed because this is the standard I use to compare.	&&&
I don't think I will ever love baby wipes because they are filled with some chemical or other but the sensitive is not bad. Compared to the natural, the smell is far less pungent and it is thicker. I reordered this for April when I realized I ordered the natural last month by mistake. I'm happy with this for the convenience it provides for my husband during diaper duty.	&&&
When our baby girl was in the NICU, these wipes were all they used. Now it's all we use at home. We love these for her skin!	&&&
"When I first plugged it in it took 3-4 hours to warm up I then added he wipes & let it sit over night & the wipes got warm.. Haven't had a problem since."	&&&
These wipes do a good job taking off a light layer of makeup but I found I had to go over my mascara a few times before it completely removed it. It would be nice if the wipes could hold more moisture and be a little more thick in texture. I find that I had to use a couple wipes to completely remove a light layer of foundation, eyeliner, and mascara. I enjoy that it does not have a strong scent and does not leave my skin feeling oily. Good option if you're looking for a more natural-based makeup wipe.	&&&
These wipes do a fantastic job on silver jewelry. They're the best.	&&&
These wipes are my go to wipes. I like that they are gentle and wonderfully sensitive for my baby's bottom. I only need one or two Pampers sensitive wipes instead of many from other brands. What a great product!	&&&
This changing mat is great! Very convenient to grab on your way out the door. It's very easy to wipe clean and has a matching wipes case included. Also it has a pocket for diapers!	&&&
These wipes are so soft! Very durable and wash clean. Can't wait to purchase a few more packs.	&&&
Babies not appreciate cold wipes on their bodies. What a great idea.	&&&
I really wanted to like these and once you get them out of the package they work great. The problem however, is getting them out of the package. The bag itself is pretty thin and tears beyond the opening quite easily. In additions when you attempt to pull the wipes out they will quite often stick together in groups of 2 or 3. So usually I will use 2 at a time for a wet diaper, I'd pull the first out just fine. Then when pulling the second I'll get 2 or 3 stuck together. I didn't feel comfortable putting ones that had been handled back in the package so many went to waste. A great wipe, it just needs better packaging.	&&&
"These are the best wipes out there for when your kids have a cold, they are so soft, smell yummy, and don't make your nose raw or sore. We always have these on hand in our house and could never go without them!!"	&&&
I love how much better changing my baby is... he loves the warmth of the wipes and doesn't fuss as much. Only thing I don't like about it is that if I take the wipes out of the bag, the device leaks out the liquid from the wipes. So, that's a bummer but I deal with it because he is so much happier.	&&&
We have been using Pampers sensitive wipes since the beginning. It is a great scent and cleans extremely well while being soft on baby's skin.	&&&
What you read is what you get with these wipes! No harsh chemicals or heavy perfumes or dyes. I use these daily, in the morning and at night to take off makeup. HOWEVER I actually pour Thayers aloe witch hazel into the pouch when I first open them since they are usually dried up. The witch hazel acts as a toner and cleanser on top of it, so I only need 2 wipes at night. They take off my makeup in a breeze, and soften up stubborn mascara. BUT again without the Thayers being added, they are rather dry and you need at least 3-4 to get a full face of makeup off. And forget getting off mascara completely with these plain, you will need to add a eye makeup remover to the wipe.	&&&
I am giving five stars because it really is a good baby wipe. HOWEVER, I personally do not find them to be any larger than any other baby wipe, meaning NOT always "One and Done"	&&&
These wipes are great!!!	&&&
I have been using makeup remover wipes for years. I have tried several brands, both name brand and store brand, and Aveeno Ultra-Calming Makeup Remover Wipes are is only brand I now use. I have dry skin and Aveen Ultra-Calming Makeup Remover Wipes not only removes all traces of makeup but also leaves my skin/face feeling fresh and clean and well moisturized. I love this product and highly recommend it.	&&&
My son is 14 months old and has NEVER had an issue with any wipes or diapers. So I thought I'd give these a try. Worst mistake of my life! After using them for one day his poor little bottom had sores! They were like little red blisters! I will never again use up & up and I don't recommend them.	&&&
These are wonderful for toddlers and kids wiping themselves. They smell great, won't get stuck in your toilet during flushing, hypoallergenic, doesn't dry the skin, easy open and close top (not a sticker and actually a plastic close top) and great for after poopy wiping. I buy in bulk through subscribe and save and send 2 packs over to their montessori school for the month for my twins to use at school. Teaxhee loves them there for all my same reasons and to wipe their faces and hands without over drying their skin with antibacterial wipes.	&&&
I keep these in the car for cleaning my hands after pumping fuel or other "dirty" occasions. I don't use them very often and so the individually wrapped kind are great because they stay moist and usable. I've been to Walmart 3 times now and they have not been in stock. Walmart used to be famed for their replenishment smarts but those days are long over. We don't go so often to Walmart anymore because it's a hassle to park and get in and then the stock outs are frustrating because it means a wasted trip. It would be nice if Walmart would offer more online so that I could actually get some of the products that they have which are great. But if you go online, it says "available in stores only" and when you go to the stores....well........not true	&&&
Each wipe is not individually packaged. No flavoring on the wipe itself.	&&&
Works as described.	&&&
We have only used the pampers wipes. They are soft and rarely have to use more than 3 wipes. I also love the pampers rewards program."	&&&
When you are hot and sweaty this does the job for you	&&&
Package of 3 for a good price!	&&&
New, easy push pop up dispenser. I like this pop up better than the previous one. These wipes are soft and wet. I like these better than any I used before. I will continue to purchase the Pampers Baby Fresh Wipes.	&&&
When looking at the price of wipes and comparing quality, Pampers wipes are top notch. I noticed they are about the same price as Huggies, but unlike Huggies, they don't fall apart and are a bit softer. I choose to buy quality over quantity anytime.	&&&
Kandoo wipes are the best. My son loves them and I do as well. I would highly recommend them for anyone!	&&&
Love how nice these are for babies of all ages--especially the little ones! These are by far my "go to" type of wipes!	&&&
I really like these wipes. My favorite have been honest co wipes but I like these just as much and they are much cheaper. Looking forward to trying the diapers when they rerelease them.	&&&
The wife likes them	&&&
"This is our 2nd wipe warmer and its the best! it doesn't dry out the wipes!!!"	&&&
I hate to mop. I mean REALLY hate to mop. This has transformed how I clean my floors and works on so many different types of flooring too!	&&&
I don't like these nearly as well as the scrubbing Lysol wipes, but they are good for sanitizing. I'm not sure I'll purchase again, because I do LOVE the scrubbing ones in the kitchen.	&&&
We got these on sale and couldnt wait til they were all gone! We like that they are simple, but are not as good as the pure and natural wipes. `	&&&
Good product. I try other and nothing beats pampers brand wipes because most other wipes gave my daughters a rash...	&&&
I was impressed about what these four little woes have done to my head lights. I was skeptical at first, but the results are candid. I would suggest this product to anyone.	&&&
These are very good for that in between stage, when your child is learning all about potty training and going through the stages where they're starting to feel independent and use the adult toilet, but these wipes are much more effective and manageable than regular toilet paper.	&&&
These are pretty good baby wipes. I do feel like Pampers Sensitive wipes are a bit thicker, so we will continue to use those. I don't have a problem using these, just prefer the sensitive.	&&&
I absolutely love these! They remove a ton of impurities and exfoliate at the same time leaving my skin feeling amazing!	&&&
I use these wipes exclusively. I've never bought them from Amazon but I do buy them from brick and mortar stores. They are the best wipes of all time! Of all time!	&&&
"I love this product - it stays put when using one handed and the outside is easy to clean! I know it's kind of a weird thing to focus on but it is a product used for poop, so cleaning is important!

I wish I would have had this for my first child. Looking forward to trying it on homemade wipes too! Other reviewers say it works well so I'll try it and see myself, so far we've only used regular refill wipes (target brand, huggies, etc) and it's been fantastic."	&&&
I like these too they make my skin so soft and smooth feeling.	&&&
Nice set of butt wipes! I use these for all sorts of things. Nice price for the set of them	&&&
"This product is just perfect my son hated having his nose cleaned or wiped. But once we starting using the grape boogie wipes he had no problem with us cleaning his nose. The wipes are soft so it doesnt irratate babies skin and the great smell is perfect gives our son something good to look forward to while we clean his nose. I would tell every mom to try this with their babies and toddlers."	&&&
Better than the Amazon ones.	&&&
Very small and super thin wipes. Do not recommend.	&&&
I received this Wipes in my baby shower. Since my baby was a newborn this were the wipes i used, they are very soft. I recommend this to moms with Newborn Babies, they might help you avoid a rash. I have been using them and i really liked the Product. Huggies is my favorite brand there is. Hope you guys find this helpful....	&&&
For the price and quality, these are wonderful. I can tell they are better for my babies skin compared to other wipes. He used to have a little redness around his crack that's now gone. They "glide" over the skins surface better, sightly larger than other wipes and smell nice.	&&&
I never tried using makeup remover wipes I would just use my kids baby wipes but then I received a sample from my walmart beauty box and decided to try it and I liked it. They help take off my makeup really well with only one wipe is all I need to get it off also the mascara that I would usually use a lot of my baby wipes to remove only took me one simple wipe.	&&&
My new favorite product!!!	&&&
We love water wipes!!! We have always been cautious about products we put on our bodies and when we had a baby I was even more so! We are doing cloth diapers and I planned to do cloth wipes but disposable ended up being easier. There are so many chemicals in baby wipes and I kept thinking "why can't we just use water!" Ha! Well my friend told me about water wipes so I checked them out, read a ton of reviews and gave them a try. I love them. No irritated skin, no chemicals. My only complaint is that the wipes don't self pull up one after the other. This is a pain when baby is covered in poo and you are struggling to try and find the end of one wipe but you continue to get a stack of 3. For a while I was folding the wipes myself... It only took 5 min to do a pack and my husband appreciated it. I will probably continue to do this. If water wipes could change the way they fold the wipes they would be 5 stars!!!	&&&
Love these diapers and how reasonable the price is.	&&&
Love the price and quality of these wipes!	&&&
Love these wipes not over wet and not too dry, just right. The scent is fantastic too!	&&&
These are amazing wipes! They are thick and work very well! Comparable to Huggies, but price is BETTER!!	&&&
These wipes are fantastic. They are so gentle on our sons' skin... we use them for cleaning hands as well as for the diaper area. He loves them!	&&&
I love these wipes! This is my fourth time purchasing these overall, first time purchasing the twin pack. I use these to help take off my makeup before cleansing. I find that most times I can use one wipe to completely remove ALL of my makeup. That's face and eye primer, eyeshadows, mascara, eyeliner, blush, contour, highlight AND foundation. ONE. WIPE. If you're a big makeup lover like I am, that's INSANE. I think the biggest tip to using a makeup wipe correctly is to use ALL OF IT. That is, use it until DRY. This makes sure that you're not only getting the most bang for your buck, but also as much makeup off of your face as possible. But in times of great need, these can also be a hail mary play after a long night out. I myself have oily skin so I ALWAYS use my favourite cleanser afterwards. These wipes will moisturize your skin for the GAWDS and while that is a huge plus, those of us with oily skin could end up looking like an oil slick and NOBODY wants or has time for that! One pack will usually last me close to a month (because as I've said, I usually use only one). All in all, HIGHLY recommend these!	&&&
Had 2 new grandkids in Dec 2014...makes a total of 8....I have been sending Costco baby wipes and diapers to my kids for years....reports are they are great....one of my daughters still buys wipes to carry in cars for cleanups....excellent quality and price....free shipping....	&&&
Smells great! Good value. Use these on my dog after he goes outside. Works well, no issues.	&&&
I like that it is relatively safe in terms of the chemicals present. I however find the individual packaging and unfolding the wipes a deal breaker when I need it instantly with a quick and messy toddler.	&&&
Great wipes with lots of uses in and out of the house.	&&&
Great product at an excellent value. These wipes are quality. They're strong, absorbent and larger than I expected. You get a 6 pack for less than $11 with Prime Pantry and that is a deal and a half! Prior to this find, I purchased Target's Up and Up Sensitive, Fragrance Free wipes. A 5 pack is the same price for less wipes that are less quality. So glad I found these!	&&&
this is great and keeps the wipes moist when not in use. Easy to use.	&&&
I love these wipes, got them for a pretty good price here on Amazon as well.	&&&
I have tried other cloth wipes, and these are by far my favorites. I like the texture, size, and thickness of these. They work so well with any diaper change, and they wash up so soft each time.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! They so thick compared to other wipes. I don't feel like I will tear through them when I'm cleaning my baby. I would recommend these to anyone!	&&&
Baby wipes are another place I'd love to have a DIY option for. Even the most "natural" of baby wipes is full of soaps and chemicals. If you have a child with sensitive skin, wipes can be a nightmare. My Monster had the worst skin issues when he was a baby. I wish I had know about these reusable Bamboo Baby Wipes when he was in diapers. They are so soft and work great. We tried them out with just water on my Lovebug and they worked great. I like the natural option (especially on diaper rashes). They were easy to use. We just used warm water and tossed them in the washer when we were done. No endless piles of discarded wipes in the trash. I felt great about using this on my kiddos and about reducing my waste.	&&&
Theses wipes are great, you cant get more pure then this, I believe in using clean and pure items, because you have no idea what your baby will be allergic to, My sister just had her baby, and she started using pamper wipes with her cloth diapers and her little girl had a massive reaction and once i gave her a pack of these it cleared up in only a few days. They are a little more pricey but all worth it for the comfort of your baby.	&&&
"These work really well for makeup removal. The cloth is nice and big, reasonably sturdy, and soft. The tea tree oil is awesome; my skin looks great. Pores refined yada yada. Cleared up some small zits, too. I don't mind the smell, but it is a little medicinal.

I have also used them a few times to clean up when I don't have time to shower. They are refreshing and eliminate odor.

I will buy these again, they have become a staple of my skin care routine."	&&&
I have tried pampers and huggies wipes. I have also tried 7th generation wipes. These are the best. The size and thickness works great on all kinds of diaper surprises.	&&&
This is an excellent product and also well priced. It is well moisturized, does not tear and does go along way. My son has sensitive skin and responds well to this product.	&&&
They are really good for moms who do not like scented wipes.	&&&
if your wipe dispenser drives you NUTS, try this one. it's heavy duty, well made, very nice lines, no big logos or designs all over. it "disappears" unlike the other containers. The insert is heavy so when you are pulling out the wipe, the container stays put. This product is so good it's positively ridiculous that I've been getting frustrated on the potty with other dumb pop-up containers!	&&&
I use these to clean up after pumping as well as on the Bashir for messes. The Aloe in it has saved our noses and skin from chafing and chaping.	&&&
Purchased for my daughter who is concerned about chemicals in the baby wipes. These are 99% water. She was using soft paper towels and water, and I wanted a chance to change my grandbabys diaper, but I was not resorting to paper towels. I found these, and my daughter loves them! Safe for the baby, and as easy to use as the other wipes.	&&&
I use and love Tarte mascara, so it seemed that the wipes would remove the mascara, but it did not completely remove it.	&&&
"100% Bamboo and I love bamboo products! I have only purchased bamboo cooking utensils and hadn't realized in can be used in making cloths. I appreciate that this product is biodegradable and contains anti-bacterial properties. The coloring isn't as bright as the picture portrays but a nice pastel shade. The stitching around the edges are good.

Eyeballing the size of it, each washcloth looks 7.5 inches wide and 7.5 inches long. My only concern is that there's little hooks within the pattern which have the potential to snag on objects in the wash or a fingernail, etc... It feels very soft and I love that it's made without chemicals! I received this product to sample and had the opportunity to share my honest thoughts about the product through posting this review. I appreciated the discount that I was given at the time of order."	&&&
"i like these wipes for the boy's bottom, because they don't leave a horrid scent behind and they do a pretty good job of cleaning up any messes he creates in, around, or even outside his diaper. this bulk packaging provides a larger amount of wipes than any size i see in the store. each box comes with one of those pop-lid containers and three individually-sealed bags of wipes. combine these wipes with a warmer, and i almost want to use them on my own bottom...

i have had a couple problems with these wipes tearing mid-wipe, which often results in needing an extra wipe and a trip to the restroom to clean up your hands before continuing on. but hey, they're not made of burlap. an occasional tear is a good trade-off for the softness of these wipes. as an extra ""good job you frugal old man"" boost to the ego, you can also get an extra discount if you add these to the subscribe & save.

you really can't go wrong with these wipes. we've never had any issues with allergic reactions, and they have always shipped in great condition with no dried-out packages. buy in bulk and subscribe for the best savings possible!"	&&&
With my first child these were fantastic. I didn't always have a paci clip to attach to my daughter so pacifiers ended up all over the place. It's nice to be able to clean pacifiers anywhere by using these wipes. The only downside I've found is that the packs would dry out a little to quickly!	&&&
I have a day care and use these wipes daily. They are tough enough for the bottom, yet gentle enough for little faces.	&&&
"I use these to clean up after pumping as well as on the Bashir for messes. The Aloe in it has saved our noses and skin from chafing and chaping."	&&&
These wipes are great! They work wonderful on my face! I received the this complimentary for review purposes. All thoughts and opinions are my own and are not influenced by anyone	&&&
I like the size of these wipes and now that they've added shea butter, they are even better. I haven't had a baby to take care of for years. I use these for myself.	&&&
My baby has very sensitive skin and is prone to eczema so these wipes are very helpful in cooling his skin.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes to use on my child. They are sturdy and don't rip easily like Huggies brand. Such a great deal too!	&&&
Take these with me wherever I go. Simply wonderful.	&&&
"We use Boogie Wipes to clean our little one's nose b/c they are softer and more gentle than tissue."	&&&
My hubby loved these. No strong scent, but he states they worked well!	&&&
The wipes are good, but we only received the base of the tub, not the lid.	&&&
These smell so much better than the regular wipes and don't make my hands peel! They are perfect for the kitchen, car, bathroom... Wherever you want! Lysol is my preferred brand over Clorox for their scents, and they always pull out one wipe, not 2-3. I recommend these!	&&&
I have applied these wipes to my Saftey glass numerous times now and sad to say, within an hour of application, my Saftey glasses are fogging on the inside. It may not be quite as bad as before applying it.	&&&
Great size, wipes easily, and the packs fit well in my diaper bags	&&&
They clean well and don't irritate her skin. I like the packs and they can fit into other wipe holders.	&&&
Couldn't keep my home clean without any of them!	&&&
Love these wipes. Keeps baby clean and smells great!	&&&
Always recommend Boogie wipes to friends and family. They clean noses quickly and easily without making the nose tender! A staple in our diaper bag.	&&&
Quality wipes at a very reasonable cost. Save even more when using Subscribe & Save. We have been using these for years and am happy to say that neither of our kids experienced rashes or anything like that when using them.	&&&
the only thing i dont like about pamper wipes is the smell but other then that i love them (: "	&&&
I use these wipes for almost everything. They clean good and disinfect and also sMell good	&&&
I'm probably addicted to cleaning with these things, but the odor is nice, the clean well, except for certain hard stains - they're perfect, especially for cleaning bathroom sinks and toilets rims.	&&&
after seeing all these reviews I wanted to try it myself and see the beautiful results everyone have been raving about but unfortunately all it did was drying certain areas in my face and causing irritations which I'm assuming from the ingredients that were sitting and marinating in the package.	&&&
The problem with these wipes is that they packets don't open easily. That's an understatement. I have used at least six brands of feminine wipes, probably more than that, and they ALL open easily. Not the Playtex. So, if the company gets the packaging right, and make easy to open packets, these will be great. The wipes themselves are very good. Gentle. Nice fragrance.	&&&
"Wipes....
Worked well, did the job :)
Huge box lasted a long time that was the best part!"	&&&
Good wipes. I like how they are perforated rather than folded into each other. Doesn't cause a rash or irritate the skin.	&&&
"The pacifier wipes are very convenient, especially when going on trips!
The only negative thing I have to say about it is the smell of the wipes. They smell like a fruity liquor drink."	&&&
"They are great!"	&&&
I use them on everything and me and son have asthma and strong sprays choke us but these wipes are the best	&&&
We love baby wipes	&&&
Best for travel and always come in handy...love the smell, not too strong or soft.	&&&
"Call me a stereotypical girl, but I HATE to have things on my hands, which makes these flight wipes perfect for me. They easily fit in my purse to make sure they're with me at all times and if my hands are messy, I have an easy and convenient way to clean up the mess.

I like the name ""flight wipes"" because on an airplane, the size of everything is shrunk to a small portion of the full sized products you're used to using, so the name is very fitting.

Carry these in your purse, leave them in your glove compartment of your car, the front pocket of your luggage - whatever works for you, just make sure they're close within reach because they're so great and useful !"	&&&
you won't be disappointed!	&&&
It is wonderful if you have small kids because you can dry as you go.This product cleans very well. I recently moved and ever those the floors were supposed to have been cleaned they left are feet black. I tried my mop and a swifer, they still would leave our feet black. But after using this product our floors are finially clean.	&&&
"Love these wipes...they are great for my little one and this package is perfect for my purse."	&&&
These are he best working wipes I have found! Huggies and Pampers have nothing on these!	&&&
Great	&&&
I bought these because the label says it kills bacteria in 15 seconds. But when I read the directions it says FIVE MINUTES! Keeping my phone, keyboard, light switches etc. WET for five minutes is impossible. Very deceptive label.	&&&
GREAT PRODUCT. THIS IS MY SECOND ORDER OF CONNOISSEURS JEWELRY WIPES. LIKE IT LOTS BETTER THAN THE JEWELRY CLOTH. PUTS A COAT ON MY SILVER, THAT HELPS IT NOT TARNISH. ALSO CLEANS MY GOLD JEWELRY GREAT.	&&&
Love these wipes. They have just the right amount of moisture in them and are so soft and cushy on baby's skin. Now the baby is 2 and we are still using them.	&&&
Good amount of wipes for a GREAT price. Fast shipping	&&&
"Nice product to have for quick clean ups."	&&&
like these cloths but not the size for a 1-6 month baby	&&&
Huggies have the best wipes. I wouldn't use any other brand.	&&&
These wipes are the best. They're just so soft on my son's skin. Love it.	&&&
"These have to be the softest Baby washcloths I have ever purchased before. These are so super soft that they are perfect from newborn to toddler stage, especially if your baby's delicate skin is prone to dry skin or rashes. Asher has had a really bad bout of Pneumonia as well as the Flu this past week and as you know, when that happens, especially with a fever as well, babies have runny noses and their facial skin tends to get very dry. When we would use a wipe or washcloth to clean his face he would cry in pain. Once I received these and felt how soft they were, plus the fact that they were organic, I knew or at least hoped this would be the answer we were looking for and thankfully I was not disappointed and I had a happier baby when we wiped his face. Bamboo is naturally soft and these really are just perfect. We were able to wash his little face without him crying at all because of how soft these were. These are a great size, 10 x 10 and are perfect not only for just facial washing but for the entire bath. Many other Baby washcloths you buy are so small that it's hard to really use them and normally I end up using a regular sized washcloth, but now these are the only baby washcloths we will use on Asher and Lilly. We also cloth Diaper and prefer to use as much organic items as possible, and we use cloth wipes as well and make our own cleaner. We actually have now started using these as our cloth wipes because they are bamboo and organic which makes them perfect for using on delicate areas to clean. We simply keep them in our wipe containers ( we have one for the Diaper bag and one for home) and just pull one out and put a small amount of our homemade cleaner on them and they work excellent, especially if your child ever has diaper rash, I would highly recommend these. My Friend was over and changed the baby's diaper last week and raved about these Organic baby Washcloths and actually decided to order a couple of sets for her sister who is about to have a baby as well. These would make a perfect addition to a new baby gift basket as well and the colors are great fro either a boy or a girl. I plan to order another set just for myself because I think they wold be great to use on my face when I wash it and clean off my makeup.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, all opinions and statements are based solely on my own experiences with the product."	&&&
Huggies wipes are the only ones I buy. They are thick, smell good and are affordable. I've used several kinds of Huggies wipes, but the sentitive onces are my favorite. The yare very soft.	&&&
They are wipes. You wipe your butt with them. Well, at least if you like to feel clean you do.	&&&
Exactly as advertised. As a side note, be sure to keep the containers closed or your wipes will dry out.	&&&
These do a great job of keeping my stainless appliances looking good.	&&&
I can't give any better or worse rating to this, because when I assembled the machine and went to test it, I noticed that the clean water tank is missing the piece that keeps the water in the tank. Without it, I have no way to fill the tank. I have ordered a new tank from hoover, but it is on back order, and will take roughly 2-3 weeks to come in. What's the point in having free two day shipping if the product isn't complete? I'll update my review once I have a complete working machine.	&&&
The title of my review says it all! I got the sensitive wipes as a shower gift because I had sensitive skin and figured my child might as well. The Pampers wipes all feel the same and are better than other brands I have tried but the sensitive scent is AWFUL! I refuse to buy them again because the scent bothers me and I feel like it lingers in the room for a while after diaper changes. I would recommend these wipes if your child has sensitive skin as the wipes are gentle yet do the jo b but try to get another scent if your babies skin can handle it.	&&&
The best wipes for colds. I use them when my little ones give me their daycare cooties. I love it because it doesnt irritate the babies' noses	&&&
I love these, makes cleaning the mask so easy I never miss a day.	&&&
We love these wipes! Best price for a good quality wipe. Our Favorites! Strong and they don't stick together.	&&&
I love these wipes!	&&&
My child has very sensitive skin so I am limited with things I can put on her. Huggies natural wipes were perfect for her sensitive skin. No irritation whatsoever!! And I just love how thick they are. My baby is 14 months and we have been using Huggies natural wipes since she was born.	&&&
Great wipes for removing my make-up in my sensitive skin.	&&&
"I (mostly) enjoyed using this for my newborn in the winter. I'm not sure if the sponge helps or makes the situation worse, despite it's intended purpose. (I think the wipes can still get funky if not used quickly.) I would not fill it full with cloth wipes unless you know you'll use them in a day or so. The wipes that came with the unit were very low quality, so I don't recommend those. There are MANY other brands of cloth wipes that are VERY nice to use when cloth diapering.

I wish I could give the unit 3.5 stars. Though the warmer has some benefits and works ok, I don't think I would purchase it again."	&&&
It is similar to any other wipes. I did not feel the medication at all so it didn't really make a difference for me	&&&
Good alcohol wipes. Thank you.	&&&
Works well, keeps baby happy. Our newborn hated the cold wipes, so we were forced to find a solution. This warmer works perfect. Just pour a half a cup of water on top each time you refill the wipes and you're all set. The top wipe is never that warm, but better than nothing.	&&&
I love Lysol disinfecting wipes. I got them for a GREAT deal! :-)	&&&
Been getting subscribe and save of the Lysol disinfecting wipes for a few years now. Wife and I both love them.	&&&
Really like these wipes. They smell awesome, and do not leave my face dry but rather very moisturized. I like that I can use them on the go and do not have to worry about the wipes leaving residue.	&&&
I only wear sunscreen and very little Cc cream but these wipes burn my face skin so bad.  So bad.....like on fire. It does do the job though.	&&&
Bought three boxes, one of which came with nothing but bone dry wipes. The other boxes are fine, but even they are rough to use, and aren't as moist as other brands. Purell uses material similar to those wet naps bbq joints give you. Real stiff and cheap feeling. Other brands I've used were much softer and felt like they contained much more moisture.	&&&
We usually buy target wipes, but I like these better. Very thick with texture and have a nice scent.	&&&
This works great on any surface really. Cleans fast and doesn't leave any messes	&&&
This disnt really heat the wipes add much asi thought it would. In Hinde sighti probably wouldn't buy this again	&&&
Great wipes, good value, really strong and is great for young children. I keep the soft pack in my car for the grandchildren. Easy to store with the soft pack with lid.	&&&
These are so easy to pull out and shine up jewelry before stepping out. No mess or production...fantastic product. I bought two because I thought I'd go through them fast, but since they're dry wipes you can use one again and again. I strongly recommend this product, I had searched high and low for an easy peasy effective jewelry cleaner and didn't think I could find a product that fit the bill. These do!	&&&
"This product saved the day. Here's my story.

Each morning in the office or at home I take Udo's Oil 3-6-9 blend. I accidentally spilled some in the office on my dress shirt that I had just picked up the other day from the cleaners, and was wearing for an important meeting. First I tried putting a lot of water on the stain, but oil and water don't mix, so that didn't work. Then I asked a co-worker if she knew how to get out an oil stain. She gave me one of these wipes.

I thoroughly moistened the stain, then used a hair dryer to dry my shirt. Most of the stain was gone, but I still saw a very slight spot. So I did a second application using the same wipe, used the hair dryer again, and voila, the stain was completely gone! My dress shirt looked good as new when I walked into my meeting.

I promptly placed an order on Amazon for a pack of 3 (12 Count) for $9.99."	&&&
These wipes used to be my favorite Kirkland item. We have been using these wipes for years, my kids are older now but we still like to keep wipes around. The wipes use to be clean and fragrance free. That has changed, these wipes now have an awful smell to them and they sting when they come in contact with a cut or rash. Please do not use these on your baby, they will make your baby cry and leave your baby irritated. Someone really messed up with this new formula, probably tested by someone without kids. Not a good choice for families looking for clean and dye free products.	&&&
"These are the best unscented wipes I have used. I have tried many natural brands and Huggies came out on top. Good value, very soft, wipes do not stick together. Highly recommend."	&&&
This is a great product! The wipes are individually wrapped and easy to keep with you.	&&&
When I use thiese clos to clean the bathroom the bathroom feels so much cleaner and safer.	&&&
Loved these Huggies wipes! They were very thick wipes compared to what I'd used before. Didn't feel like stuff was seeping through the wipe when used.	&&&
Love these wipes. My daughter has sensitive skin and these work wonders on her. I also love how thick they are compared to other wipes.	&&&
Waste of wipes...just use baby wipes!	&&&
"These wipes make your life so easier that I love them! I'm so lazy when it comes to remove my make up (that I use every day!) that this come on handy! I love them!

They can be a bit expensive but they don't give me any allergies, so I think is worth it. I buy bulk when I can or take advantage of promotional offers. Overall I would recommend."	&&&
Love Huggies wipes! We never had any issues with rashes when we used these wipes! I love the smell & feel! Super soft!	&&&
I love these wipes they are soft but durable and while they are unsceted they don't have that funky unscented smell I've smelled in other wipes!! Early on we found out the hard way that our baby could not tolerate scented wipes or diapers so these have been wonderful!!	&&&
I like these wipes. They are durable. And unscented perfect for baby's sensitive skin.	&&&
They're wipes and work good.	&&&
We buy wipes at big box store, keep them in this on the changing table. Works great, easy to pull out the wipes and keeps them moist. Love this purchase. Have been using for 2+ years.	&&&
These are the BEST wipes there are. They are wet and large. You can use one of these wipes instead of 3 or 4 of other brands. Using these with my third child. Wish I had these with my other two. Will never use anything else.	&&&
These wipes clean thoroughly but are a bit hard to get out of their wrappings.	&&&
These are the best personal wipes out there. I use them particularly when camping--very comfortable and always moist with individual packaging. Best price away from Costco, too!	&&&
Love lysol wipes, the texture the smell all the uses they are good for disinfectant toilet walls sink. I use in kitchen living room , bedrooms really every where in the house. Use for puppy messes, tthis wipes are perfect for all cleaning.	&&&
I used these clorox wipes daily. I have a 3 year son who is always getting into stuff so I have to keep my home sanitary. These wipes do everything I need them to do. Love the 3 pack I can put one in each room in my home.	&&&
"I've been using Huggie Wipes for many years for general use, and I have to say I kind of like these Amazon wipes! They are more cloth like and more stretchable. I guess everyone has their own preference with wipes, and I guess it depends what you use them for. But, I like them so far and will probably start buying these from now on. I only tried the unscented ones so far. And so far so good.

UPDATE: After using these for several weeks, I noticed that these are not as wet as huggie wipes, but they still do the job. Also, with anything its hard to find one product that does it all. As I had mentioned before, I use wipes for cleaning my face/hands etc and also use wipes throughout the week to clean counters after spraying with a disinfectant etc. These wipes are superior and soft for skin cleaning, but not as tough enough as huggies wipes for quick clean ups. So, I'll continue to purchase huggies wipes for cleaning and these for personal use."	&&&
"In my video review, I show how the 448-count box looks and works(there are different count boxes and they come in different containers so you need to know how they differ), and its main features. The 448-count box was a better value than other boxes for these wipes, but honestly, I was disappointed that the opening on top was only a sticker that didn't last very long. I wish that the product description explained that these are better when used with the plastic box container instead of by themselves because resealing using the sticker on these just doesn't work. These are great value and I really like the quality of the wipes themselves, but the packaging/containers and the company's claim that the wipe packages are ""resealable"" is just not true.

So I noticed there are many questions posted about these boxes and some of the answers are confusing so I hope this video clearly shows what you're getting. If this review was helpful, please click on 'yes' below and happy shopping!"	&&&
Great wipes for any camera lens. Great price.	&&&
I am a caregiver and my clients are not always have the best hygiene. I leave a canister of Lysol Disinfecting Wipes on the back on the toilet for convenience. I feel terrible if someone comes and it was not clean for them. Plus it is so convenient to pull one out and quickly clean up any misses. They stay fresh and wet to use. Pleasant smelling.	&&&
It is so soft and gentle. I was using a store branded wipes and they felt rougher to the touch. Easy switch.	&&&
The moister in these wipes hold a lot better than other wipes I have tried in the past. These are now my go to wipes for everything related to my baby. I use 1-2 for a diaper change and about 3-4 for a real dirty diaper change. They are great for when my little one gets herself in the mud and dirt. one wipe and her hands are clean. These are also great for when she begins to play with her fruits and veggies. highly recommended product.	&&&
Love these wipes!!!! Only thing is it should come with a tub to keep it in	&&&
"These wipes have changed my beauty routine completely. I use them to remove eye makeup and do a quick once-over. Then I wash my face with a gentle liquid cleanser. I then use the clean portion of the very generous wipe to go over my face again since it does not need to be rinsed off.
I have struggled with dry skin patches, red rough skin around my eyes and generally problematic sensitive skin for the past year. I used expensive treatments, lotions, vitamins, soaps, non-soaps to no avail. This Aveeno product made a HUGE immediate difference and I have stopped using ALL nighttime creams and serums.
My skin now feels smooth, soft and supple and it can breathe all night without a bunch of ""product"". I cannot explain what a relief it is to have something work and work so fast. I have used other Aveeno products and now I plan to try more of the calming group to support my changing, sensitive skin. This product is a winner."	&&&
These wipes are very easy to use in a pinch when you don't want to fully clean the oven top with the liquid cleaner.	&&&
We started using these when my daughter was a newborn - as recommended by my pediatrician to use for the first little while. I tried switching to standard name brand wipes but they were really wet and my daughter broke out in a rash. The biggest downside is that they don't overlap so you have to pull them out one at a time. Otherwise, I think they work great, and are handy to have around for wiping faces and hands!	&&&
Super great, they work very well for cleaing breastfed baby poops. I've been using them dry with Lovey's tushi wash. They are impressive quality and I've washed them many times and used them as a cloth diaper doubler in a pinch. The top side is all I use, the back side it a little too soft. I bought Grovia wipes as well, which also work very well, at a better price, but are stringy on the edges.	&&&
Shipped quick. Easier and better priced than local stores!	&&&
These wipes come in handy for runny noses! For baby and mommy lol I buy these and the off brand as well and love these more i think its the scent that I love	&&&
Makes my stainless smeary.....I do not like using the,	&&&
We use these all the time. I keep the larger size under the sink in the kitchen for cleaning counters, stove, and microwave. These smaller containers we keep in the bathrooms to wipe down surfaces and also outside to clean the grease off of the grill. My husband keeps one of these containers in his locker at work or his tool bag and uses them to wipe down his truck every morning before starting his shift. These Lysol wipes smell fresh and do a good job cleaning.	&&&
The only wipes that I've found that doesn't break my babies skin out in bumps. I also love the thickness of these wipes and works great for makeup removal.	&&&
Im currently using these wipes as my husband accidentally bought them instead of the soft skin and i decided not to return them because they looked jut as good if not better. The smell is nice and i like that they're natural and fragrance free && hypoallergenic but they tear super easily and i feel like i have to use double the amount of wipes then normal and when its a messy diaper and you're out and about the last thing you want is your fingers tearing a hole into the wipe as you're wiping and getting yourself all messy i usually wash my hands after changing a diaper but there isnt always a sink with running water and antibacterial soap. so after these are gone i will purchase something else.	&&&
Love these disinfecting wipes, use them on all sorts of surfaces	&&&
"these work wonders! we all have kids and dried up mucus. these are great and don't harm my son at all. I will continue to buy these for a really long time!"	&&&
I love these wipes for really dirty jobs like toilets, kitchen grease, freezers and fridges. Also for day to day touch ups.	&&&
its baby wipes lol whats not to love they did however come fast and that was awesome	&&&
We have tried many different brands of wipes, but these have come out on top. I like the smell and they are very soft. They do a great job - even for big messes, I almost never need more than one wipe. They are soft enough and gentle enough to use for quick clean-ups after eating and they don't irritate my daughter's butt, even when she has diaper rash. I don't plan to use another wipe after discovering these.	&&&
"These wipes are a great size for most electronics in a container that's a perfect size to travel with. I have bought other Monitor wipes, but they are too large to "waste" on a phone or tablet and dry out before they are gone. This type are smaller and in a smaller container for a very reasonable price."	&&&
Same ones i got at the hospital , love them	&&&
"These Reusable Diaper Wipes are outstanding to have around for the little guys running the house. They are definitely not small. They are truly soft and absorbent. They definitely will leave a smile on your babies face. After washing for the first time they did not shrink or alter the texture. I highly recommend this product.

This product was received for the purpose of inspection and for an un-biased review."	&&&
I stopped using regular tissue long ago and switched to these. They keep you feeling cleaner, fresher and even my husband has started using them. If you are older and have had children, generally you have a problem with hemmorhoids at times...these are wonderful, keep things clean and don't irritate. They also help prevent UTI's by cleaning thoroughly, since I am in a wheelchair and UTI's are the bane of those of us who can't stand for very long....the ones for sensitive skin are great. No perfumes or extras. Also, along with a container for home, you get a package with some 'travel packs' that are great for keeping in your car for travel and also work as 'wet wipes' if you need to wipe hands or face!	&&&
The best wipes ever. Ever. Soft, cloth like, soothing with no harsh chemicals. Amazing. Great to use from preemie all the way to adulthood!	&&&
As a young friend of mine once said, "Janis, Shout saved my life." I would add that it also saves my reputation - without it, I'd be more of a mess than I usually am. I've tried all the other stain removers, and keep coming back to Shout. Just wish they'd go back to making the Shout stick!	&&&
Got broken after a month of using it.	&&&
Worked as described, headlights look new!!!!!!!!!	&&&
Like these wipes! Nice scent, flush able, serves the purposes! Can be useful for other things! Like wiping down window sills	&&&
I used to use another brand. But the general wipe have alchohol and that dries up a very sensitive area. I have not had has issues with these. They just work	&&&
The on-the-go wipes dispenser is great. We are constantly away from home and the dispenser is durable and easy to use when changing diapers at a store or in the car.	&&&
They worked good. But I thought I was buying a box misread its a small pack.	&&&
Works as advertised. Even takes off eye make up.	&&&
These are nice, but they are a little thin. With the coupon, the price was better than the other ones. They do their job, but they could be a tad bit thicker.	&&&
The Germ-X Antibacterial wipes, in my opinion, are superior to any other similar products on the market. They are large-size, easy-to-use and handle wipes and they don't have the overpowering aroma of some of the competing wipes. I discovered them a few years ago in the Sam's Club and regularly purchased them until the Club stopped stocking them. This was a big disappointment for us and our business and we tried other wipes but none compared to the Germ-X product. I went online to find a purchase source for Germ-X and discovered that we can order them online from Sam's and, of course, was very happy to be able to get the Germ-X Wipes again. My comment: Thanks Sam's Club!	&&&
"I have been using the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for years. I have three children who love to make a mess when eating and playing. The wipes are so convenient it really helps me keep up with the three of them. I used to say it was three against one and I was out numbered, now I feel as if i I the advantage with these Clorox wipes on my side. Everything from counter tops, tables, floors, furniture, walls, light switches, TV remotes, etc... I could go on. I probably use double the amount of wipes in the winter wiping door knobs to help fight against the colds that come with winter.

Love the wipes Clorox.

Shelly B""}}];"	&&&
I love these wet wipes. They work like they are suppose to and doesn't irritate my daughters skin at all and you can not beat the price of these!! I would recommend if you baby has sensitive skin!	&&&
these are okay, but honestly, i don't see the point in paying the extra buck just because they say ''always'' when i could just buy baby wipes instead. its the same thing. WHAT i did like is, i'm not sure if they still make these, but they used to make pads with the wipes attached to each pad. i loved that. it was very convenient!	&&&
Large and sturdy. I feel comfortable wiping my child' diaper area, face and hands with these terrific wipes.	&&&
A favorite of mine to put in a gift basket for moms. I'm a pediatric dental hygienist. Clean those mouthes out and avoid Early Childhood caries. Great price too	&&&
Having this product in our home is a requirement. My two year old is more than OK with having his nose cleaned at all times due to the gentleness of these wipes. Pleasant scent and keeps a tiny nose from becoming red and tender.	&&&
Some of the best wipes I have used. Does have a scent if you want something with a lighter sent go for huggies natural.	&&&
These are pricier due to the individual wrapping and branding, but they are pretty good. Sometimes, especially for those with health issues, just toilet paper doesn't cut it. These are a nice solution so you can keep one on you if needed since the other brands all come in big dispensers.	&&&
Found out about this product on a forum looking for a better product to clean my English Bulldogs wrinkles. This product is exceptional, it has eliminated the funky smell and gunk in my bulldogs upper nose wrinkle, which no other product that I have tried was able to do. It has also eliminated everyday cleanings (now every other day) and does not cause the irritation that some of the other products caused. I told my vet that I had changed to these and he highly recommended the product.	&&&
I like Wal-Mart and Dollar General's wipes better...these slip and don't grip what your wiping and they are a little harsh/sting.	&&&
weve been using the warmer for 3 months. at first we felt it was a lifesaver but now the wipes arent warm and the push button to flip open the top is broken. we tried pampers and up & up brand wipes in it and the pamper wipes were really thick for the opening. the sponge dries out quickly too.	&&&
"They work great and don't hurt little noses.
Yeah! :-)"	&&&
Love Amazon Deals! Works well on my tile and hardwood floors.	&&&
Great washcloths extremely soft.	&&&
I'm not sure if you all realize, but you are getting FOUR of these large tubs... Clearly i didn't read the fine print and i ordered "two" of these... imagine my surprise when i received a large box containing EIGHT... incredible deal at $9.98 for FOUR tins... these things are sturdy, refillable and now i have more wipes and tubs than i know what to do with... if the apocalypse hits though, these tubs are going to become bricks of gold...	&&&
These ear wipes are just too dry. I love the company's other products, the eye wipes, their shampoos and conditioner, but these wipes just don't do much if anything at all.	&&&
"We use this warmer for our cloth wipes! It keeps them wet and warm! No complaints!"	&&&
These are great for quick touch ups on my stove. I use them almost daily and the stove always shines and looks clean!	&&&
Grilling season! Raw chicken on the counters is bad! Clorox wipes take care of it.	&&&
"These are great! I clean all my electronic devices with them. Phone, lap top, tablet, etc.
I keep it right on my office desk."	&&&
I love these in my bags. The hard cases take up more space and can let the wipes dry out, plus you can't see inside. The soft packs are too big and noisy. I love that I can see how much is in the pack, load it as needed and it so compact! It holds a lot of wipes. I have two in diapers and it's held more than enough for two weeks worth of outings.	&&&
These wash clothes are so soft and get softer after every wash! They are super absorbent and they are naturally antibacterial because they are made from bamboo which is very impressive! I will no longer use any other type of material for my baby's needs! Wonderful company with excellent customer service!!!	&&&
"My Brother ScanNCut mats are better than when they were new! I saw this trick on YouTube that said use non-alcohol baby wipes. It's even easier to clean the mats than it looked in the video I saw. Exceeded my expectations.

It even got out the ink (or lint?) in the cuts left on the mat. Picking that stuff off the mat with tweezers as the ScanNCut manual says was way more than I was willing to do just to whip out a cute treat box. And these will definitely make your mats last longer.

I usually use Pond's wet towelettes on my dog's eyes and ears and that wasn't going to change, but PrimePantry didn't have any when I ordered so I used these. I'm pretty loyal to Pond's for this purpose, but these packs are way more reasonable and most eye matter is effortlessly removed. He has no complaints and there are definitely more in a pack.

The top snaps so that the towelettes won't dry out. Well designed pack. I love all of the Amazon brand products I've tried and these are no different.

I really couldn't see the size when I ordered, but these are good size packs. Just a little shy of Kleenex box sizes. A lot of wipes for the money. We're going to make these a staple in the home."	&&&
"Okay I have to say that I still thing generic wipes are a better deal than these BUT as these are a tad more than just baby wipes I felt the need to give 5 stars.

They do sort of lather up so that you feel you can clean sticky hands and faces with them but not so much you feel like you still have a film of soap scum on you.

I will still do generic but any time I'm in a pinch and need a Prime Membership delivered I will pay the extra couple of bucks for these."	&&&
we love huggies wipes in our household! while we lean more towards the one-and-done, the naturally refreshing wipes get the job done just fine. plus, they smell great and leave our daughter's hiney fresh and clean without irritation.	&&&
These are super useful if you are a diabetic and use a pump or wear a CGM sensor, like IV Prep wipes they make the skin sticky, but the level of stickyness is much greater than IV prep wipes. Before using this my CGM sensors would barely last 5 days, now I'm able to use them for the full 7day lifetime.	&&&
Not as large as expected but works well since it is packaged for portability. Use it for travel and as a wetone in auto. Husband uses it for freshness.	&&&
Absolutely fantastic and high quality product. At first one may think that warmed wipes is a bit cheesy or excessive for babies and that they can do without... Well having now experienced both sides of the argument I wholeheartedly support the warmed wipes! They don't startle or upset baby, which translates into happy baby, happy parents, and decreased sleep interference, which as any parent knows (especially parents of multiples) is a rare and precious commodity.	&&&
Goto wipes for around the house everyday use.	&&&
Smells good and love the quantity that comes in each container. Just remember to close the lid. The ones near the top dry up VERY fast	&&&
This is the only brand I've tried but they seem to work well. I like the box, it's easy to use & the wipes are good size, not too thick, not too thin.	&&&
so soft, bought a ton of these	&&&
These are great, I keep a pack in my bag and never go on trips with out them. They clean nice, and smell good. They are not greasy or oily, but don't dry your skin either. A must for all trips."	&&&
I love using Clorox disfectant wipes. They are so handy for countertops and good for a quick clean up in the bathroom. They help me keep ahead of the germs.	&&&
Pampers Natural Clean Wipes work great because they are very strong, and you do not have to use a lot of them to get the job done.	&&&
"I first came across this at the hospital where our baby was born. These look like paper towels but are actually more like thin cotton cloth. They are super soft. The hospital gave us a few to use as baby-wipes. After bringing the baby from the hospital, I searched a lot online. I did not know the brand since the hospital gave it in a simple plastic bag. I asked the nurses, but they did not know either. Finally a review on Amazon on this product is how I found that this was the thing I was looking for. I've purchased a few a couple of boxes of it now. 500 is a lot and it will last for a few months. I cut each into 4 squares since you usually don't need to use the whole wipe at once. I cut it while watching TV/movie. We exclusively use this as baby wipes for diaper changes.

We used Huggies wipes only for the daycare, since dipping it in water took them time and they had other babies to take care of too. However, since the baby got rashes, one teacher suggested that I pre-moisten these wipes for them and keep it in the wipes box. That way they did not have to spend an extra time and the baby was free from the chemicals in the wipes. After we made this switch the incidents of rashes has reduced a lot. For the one month that we switch exclusively to these washcloths, she has had only one incident of a diaper rash. Before that she used to have rashes at least 3 times a week and used to cry during diaper changes. Thanks to the daycare teacher who gave us the suggestion to pre-moisten these wipes!

Tips:
1. Cut each wipe into 4 to reduce wastage
2. Keep a spray bottle with water handy during diaper changes for travel. I got one from a dollar store. I spray each square with water and use the most wipe to clean.
3. For diaper changes at home, I prefer to keep a plastic bowl with water near the changing table. Its easier to dip the wipe with one hand since you need the other hand to hold the baby. Can't do that with a spray bottle in the other hand."	&&&
My 8 month old son has become very active and these wipes help get the job done quickly before he makes a bigger mess.	&&&
These actually work better than baby wipes because they are thick and plush. I just use water (no soap) which I guess is more gentle on a baby than all the chemicals and scents in a regular disposable wipe.	&&&
What can I say... they don't leave residue on your face or leave it feeling sticky or grose but they don't clean it either. You need to really and I mean REALLY scrub your face and even with two or three wipes used at a time there is still makeup left over. I'm sad. They were just TOO simple to do the job :("	&&&
It works well if you use it every day but when I stopped for a day because i cut my face open and went back to using it my face broke out like crazy and I had to completely cut them out of my lide"	&&&
Good but some of the wipes are dry..	&&&
"Great, affordable basic. I use them on my Boston Terrier when he comes in all muddy. He then gives me the stink eye and runs to his crate to escape my attempts to clean him up.

- They seem equally sturdy when compared to the other brands I've used
- They're adequately moist
- The packaging was simple and I appreciate that."	&&&
Convenient! I have a box in my car and one at work. I have found that when on the road, you never know what you will encounter and being able to clean your hands on the spot is important. These wipes make it easy to do this without hesitation and have proven useful time and time again.	&&&
"Great hand sanitizer wipes with only alcohol.
Safe to use before eating."	&&&
As noted by several recent reviews, and as is usually the case, new product packaging begets new crappy product. The old wipes - in the old packaging - were excellent. Now, they are akin to dry thin towels. I'm a guy, so I need 6 or 7 thick wet wipes ready and prepped for any diaper change. These things no longer get the guy seal of approval. Not sure how the manufacturer can claim the product hasn't changed. It's as clear as the poo left on my kid's bottom.	&&&
These wipes are so soft! But they are still durable so I don't have to use multiple wipes for one diaper. Its excellent. Not to mention, they were a fantastic deal. Im a huge fan of Pampers wipes.	&&&
"I love how warm the wipes are. But the light is very annoying at night."	&&&
Until I purchased this product, I would use Windex to clean my computer screen. Although the latter's non-streak formula worked fine on windows, it didn't on my computer, i.e. my screen was streaked. I also tried eyeglass cleaner and that didn't work either. These 3M notebook screen cleaning wipes are simply great. The screen looks as spotless and virginal as it did the day the computer arrived. This is no mean feat as I use hand cream with Lady Macbeth type regularity so the screen looks pretty greasy early in the day. Because these wipes are individually packaged, I can tuck them into my purse so that even when away from home keeping the screen pristine is easy.	&&&
This is our 2nd wipe warmer and its the best! it doesn't dry out the wipes!!!	&&&
I don't care for the wipes. They tear easy and don't smell very good. So I need to wipe my mask and let it sit before I go to bed. My other wipes I could wipe and put right on. So I won't buy theses again.	&&&
I ordered these wipes in a 200 count a few years ago. They work great. Cleaning phone screens, glasses, etc. New order is the same product and quality.	&&&
I will never purchase this product again! It leaves an unsightly residue on all surfaces.	&&&
Best wipes for babies with sensitive skin. They are the perfect thickness. Unlike other brands that I have tried, these do not leave a film on the skin.	&&&
Worked great, just about to order more.	&&&
I usually buy Ole Henriksen Grease relief wipes, but I thought these would be a copy cat at a great price. So the cons are that in my personal experience, the cloth's 'exfoliating' side felt really rough, like scratches. I only used the soft side after that first one. Super random, it also made my lips numb (even if it was just close to my lips, not even directly on them) That is the most random side effect that has ever happened to me. So ya, if you avoid your lips, and the scratchy side, it's still a good price for how many you get.	&&&
Great price! The only wipes that my kids could use and not have irritated skin	&&&
Love these wipes. They smell great -- fresh and clean without being overpowering. They also don't dry out my kids' sensitive skin, which other wipes seem to do. We bring these on trips and have them at the food tables when we're hosting families @ our house. I have these on Subscribe & Save and can't recommend them enough.	&&&
There were black spots on the wipes. I am not sure if it was mold or what but I will hold off buying any more wipes from Huggies.	&&&
I use these to hold dry wipes and changing table covers in my diaper bag. It's exactly what I was looking for, light, not bulky and keeps the wipes and covers separate and easily accessible in the diaper bag	&&&
I use these for a long period of time. Great wipes.	&&&
"""I can not believe how quickly these wipes were shipped directly to my home. I ordered them on a Monday afternoon and they were delivered before 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning!!!!

They clean really well and have a very pleasant crisp clean cirtus scent.

The price could not be beat.

I usually buy disinfecting wipes at a ""Big Box"" store, but Staples was considerably cheaper.

I have ordered several cleaning items from Staples in the past and, once again, their delivery and customer service can only be described as exceptional!!!!"""	&&&
These baby wipes smell nice and get the job done.	&&&
The wipes do what they say they will do - remove makeup, dirt, etc and are good for sensitive skin. What I cannot get past is the smell of it. I cannot really describe it other than unpleasant. I appreciate that it is not overly floral or chemical smelling but I honestly thought I bought a bad batch and repurchased another pack in case it was the fact. Smell is always a personal choice so I would recommend people try it if they are looking for a good facial wipe. Just not sure I will purchase a gain due to the smell (even though I am a HUGE FAN OF AVEENO PRODUCTS.	&&&
I have tried various types of wipes in the past. My husband hates the Pampers sensitive, which was probably my favorite. These are a little wet, but work well for me. My main problem with them was that I did not know i needed to have my own dispensing tub. Luckily I had a one lying around still -- but it is important to know. I think these wipes are thick enough. I have not had the problem with another brand, where each wipe would tear as I was pulling it through. These seem to be sturdy. At times, I have thought they were a tad wet - but that has been coming in helpful with her more solid bm's. These are not my favorite, but I think they are pretty good.	&&&
Large packs with excellent quality wipes. I used name brand sensitive wipes with my first child. Decided to give these a try and have been very pleased. They are soft and stay moist. My children have very sensitive skin and eczema bug these wipes do not bother them at all. I now subscribe bi-monthly.	&&&
I use the wipes on the dashboards of my cars and the spray on the tonneau cover of my pickup. Access, the tonneau maker specifically recommended 303 and I see why. The cover looks great and it's obvious that UV damage is greatly reduced due to the 303 Protectant.	&&&
Work great!	&&&
tastes like candy so I didn't use them. Visited a pediatric dentist and he said tooth and gum wipes are completely unnecessary. Just wipe child's mouth with a cotton cloth or use a soft bristled, child's toothbrush.	&&&
I'm a nurse and have used these wipes in some of the hospitals I've worked at and really like them. It seems there is less sensitivity to them so less rashes. I am expecting so got these in preparation for my little one.	&&&
Purchased 30DEC15... they now have a bad Oder to them. Only used them about 3 times... have to dump the rest....	&&&
Loved these wipes and ease of filling the wipes warmer. These are strong and thick and get the job done.	&&&
For someone who's OCD about germs, or cleaning in general, this is for you. I love how easy it is to use, and how it can be used for any surface. I rest easy,, knowing my home has the deepest clean finish it deserves.	&&&
Great alternative to giving the baby a bath in the first few weeks, or until the umbilical cord falls off.	&&&
I Love how soft these wipes are plus being able to reuse the container with bags of wipes is more environmentally friendly than the individual plastic wipes packs. They are also very thick.	&&&
I like these wipes. Easy to use with the refill container!	&&&
Great for face because they're soft, yet provide some physical exfoliation without irritation.	&&&
These are the softest cloth wipes. I've been using these for a month and the seam seems to be holding up fine. I debated getting a product marketed specifically as cloth baby wipes, after all they are glorified washcloths. I'm impressed with the texture and thickness every time I use one. They are thick enough to hold some substance and not feel like I'm straight touching poop nor are they too thin or "cheap".	&&&
Best wipes have been using them for years! My son is ten years ole, we've been using these since he was potty trained. They are strong and wipe well for little fingers and they have not clogged my toilet, which is a plus! They are gentile and smell good too. The moisture is just right, it doesn't leak if squeezed. Perfect wipes!	&&&
Product is too thin and shreds into tiny pieces when trying to pull it out of the package. Double the price of other similar wipes, but I wasted half of them trying to get them out... One time purchase only.	&&&
I use these wipes every single day! They do what they got to do!	&&&
They work wonderful I'm very happy with them and my Grand daughter is happy too that was my biggies worry and You took care of that for me thank you .	&&&
"Chemical irritant! Do Not Use! We heard horror stories about babies getting chemical burns from their diapers so we stayed far away from huggies products. Many people have told me about their bad experiences with their products, I figured wipes would be a safe bet. I bought some on sale... Well after 1 week of using their wipes my child's skin was bright red and very irritated. I am pissed that this product is even on the market, I wouldn't even want to see what their diapers would do to a child.

I never thought wipes would do such a thing, I tried all sorts of baby wipes from walmart and never had any reaction. This stuff is bad news.

So far, the Costco baby wipes have been the best quality over all, some of the ingredients in there I don't agree 100% with but is hands down so far the best.

Stay away from huggies products!!!"	&&&
using these wipes since the hospital. clean wonderfully - one or two does the job so not a lot of waste	&&&
Clorox wipes! These things are great for quickly wiping down counters, faucets, tables, toilet seats, etc. I usually avoid using products that contain bleach due to the harsh smell and the fact that it kills EVERYTHING (good AND bad germs). However, I like Clorox wipes because they smell great and keep surfaces looking fresh and clean."	&&&
"This product arrived quickly. These hand wipes are excellent, not too big and the right amount of liquid. I use them a lot for traveling to clean the plane area I will be using and for eating out.
They also stay wet in packaging a long time and I have had others that dry out in a couple of months, unopened."	&&&
These wipes are very soft. They clean well and don't leave residue.	&&&
These are by far my favorite but wipes. They smell fresh and are strong enough to get the job done. Have used these for years and still do.	&&&
Works great ;) just make sure you purchase the holder.	&&&
The scent is great and it cleans pretty good, only takes a couple of wipes to get ride of big messes!!!	&&&
Works better then Armoral. I ordered the wipes and the 8 oz spray. Use one of the wipes until it no longer leaves the 303 product on the surface & then simply refresh the wipe with a spray or 2 of the liquid. This stuff really works & has no oily residue or bad smell.	&&&
Good product. Works well.	&&&
These are the best wipes hands down. I love the refill box thingy that comes with it, way less hassle than their biggest competitor. I love these wipes because they stay moist longer than "the other brand". They do have a strong scent at first, however you don't notice it later on. They are the perfect thickness also. Will never switch brands ever ever ever. And work great for other household messes as well.	&&&
These are the only wipes we use on our baby! We love these wipes!	&&&
Have bought from retailers for years. Found for a good deal on Amazon. Strong, thick, and love the scent. This packaging does come with 2 huge zipper bags of wipes and 1 hard plastic tub to fill with wipes.	&&&
Great wipes. Strong but not to thick. Great for sensitive booties.	&&&
Love this product!	&&&
really like these wipes, they are soft, fabric like. Not to wet, and don't leave a slimy slippery feel after using.	&&&
"was really nice until it stopped working one day! had it 3 months"	&&&
After many hospital visits with my father, and with both parents being susceptible to illness, I bought these after seeing them in the hospital. Not only is the smell not as harsh as other cleaners, it also kills many different types of germs and viruses! This is a must have in our household!	&&&
these are great for kids. they smell good too. bought the grape ones for my son and I love how they clean his little nose.	&&&
So easy to use	&&&
Wipes are really very good. Not more than 1 is required at a time. they are also odourless	&&&
Pampers wipes clean well and do not fall apart easily..love the thickness of the wipes too...its not just for babies in diapers it is also great for toddlers potty training...	&&&
These makeup wipes work amazing they exfoliate and really help to remove all that old makeup from your face, I love these wipes.	&&&
I have tried many brands And am usually quite picky about the wipes I use. These blew me away. Perfect thickness and texture and great for sensitive skin. The price can't be beat. These are my new favorite wipes	&&&
My 8mo old has had a runny gross nose for 4 weeks now and boogie wipes are so nice and gentle on his sensitive skin. He hasn't had a red irritated or dry nose thanks to boogie wipes!	&&&
I liked these wipes but wish they were a bit softer.	&&&
I love these wipes! They're extra sensitive which makes me feel more confident with my nieces tiny little delicate bottom. Great quality and such a great deal. My niece's skin is super sensitive and she breaks out very easily with the average wipes but these wipes kept her delicate skin softer than a baby's bottom!	&&&
Great durable wipe case. We use it for the diaper bag. Only issue is that the top wipes start to dry out if not used often.	&&&
You need a tub with these wipes, they are the replacement packs.	&&&
"These are great wipes. They're large in size and very soft. They have just the right amount of moisture. If the top wipes seem dry, I just turn the container upside down and the liquid soaks down through the stack of wipes so they're all nice and wet by the time we need another wipe. They are unscented, which I also really like. They're the only wipes that don't irritate my son's skin. He gets a rash when we try to use any other wipes. We buy these in bulk now!! My only complaint is that the wipes are hard to separate from each other. I stopped trying to use them in a hard plastic wipes container because I was always having to open the lid to get the next wipe out. I use the wipes straight out of the refill container and it works better. It's a minor inconvenience for a product that keeps my baby clean and is nice on his skin!"	&&&
Easy to use. Does a great job!	&&&
Really Good Wipes have a good thickness to them and are not small. I use these and my favorite brand BabyGanics Wipes	&&&
These wipes are moist and durable. The only problem I have with these wipes is that the wipes leave an off smell on my kid's hands after it dries. When BabyGanic first launched, these wipes had the same off smell right out of the pack, so this is an improvement. I think if I follow up with a dry napkin or tissue, it might elminate the smell.	&&&
I like these and they work great, but the only down fall is after about going through 15 wipes or so there are two that are stuck together with some sort of glue and that is a hassle to pull them apart. Other then that they are great. i even use them to clean toys and other things!	&&&
Excellent product and delivery.	&&&
Wasn't sure if I'd like the smell of these wipes, since you can't sniff the packaging online. However, they do smell clean and fresh (not too strong) and really do a great job picking up dust on the dashboard/controls/wheel of the car. I first cleaned my car with a paper towel and car cleaner, but was dissatisfied with the amount of dust still clinging to the dashboard. When I pulled 2 of these wipes out and gave it another pass they pulled off all the dust that I'd been unable to get with a soft cloth and paper towel. And the car smells pleasantly clean!	&&&
Awesome wipes and they were exactly what I was looking for. They clean without having a grotesque perfume-y smell everywhere. Plus, I can use them to remove makeup too! They do last a long time too, and it's nice that you get another wipes container with every shipment. We have come up with all kinds of uses for them.	&&&
These lens wipes clean my eye glasses perfectly. I carry a few pack with me every where I go. The wipe stays moist as it is sealed in an individual air tight pack.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes are effective and very much needed for the home. Mine came packaged in a box to hold all three canisters and nothing leaked or spilled. I use these to clean everything in my room, from the tables to things covered in dust before I store them away into containers. A heads up for everyone using these wipes: these are NOT baby wipes or facial wipes. They will burn your face and your skin. I did not read the instructions before I used these wipes and was cleaning for about an hour with half a canister's wipes and with my hands in contact with them the entire time. After I was done cleaning, my hands were burning a bit and were red. I had to rinse them out real well with water before the burning feeling went away. So it's great if you're using these a few wipes at a time for quick messes, but use protective gloves for longer cleaning sessions.	&&&

The purest, most simple baby wipes out there. No artificial smells, colors, or harmful chemicals. Baby's tushie feels great! ;-)	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. I keep a spray bottle on the changing table with homemade wipe solution and spray either the wipe or baby's bottom. I think they do a MUCH better job cleaning up (I can use just one cloth wipe where I end up using multiple disposables in one change). I also like being able to control the ingredients in the wipe solution - no alcohol to dry out her bottom or other chemicals. My husband likes them so much he said even if we switched to disposable diapers, he would want to keep using these wipes!	&&&
Great for sensitive skin. I use it for morning and night care. While at the beach I got a little too much sun. The Aveeno wipes were really cooling and moisturizing. .	&&&
We love Pampers brand. Although we can't always afford the price of the diapers, we try and always buy the wipes. I think they are the perfect size of wipes and just help my kids to feel clean. I have four kids and don't plan on stopping the use of these wipes anytime soon.	&&&
I love the product and it is very easy to use	&&&
I love Germ X Antibacterial Soft Wipes Singles 100 count box. They are very convenient to carry in my purse, rather than have a small bottle of liquid antibacterial that could pop open to mess up the inside of my bag. The individually wrapped wipes stay moist, unlike other brands I have tried. i have noticed that most restaurants use the same wet cloth to wipe down table after table after table. I use my wipes to clean the table where I have been seated. You would be surprised the dirt that the wipe picks up. I also use them to wipe the salt and pepper shakers that everyone handles and are sometimes sticky. I rated the value at only four stars because I can no longer buy them in the Sam's Club Stores. The price of the item remained the same; however, when you add in the cost of shipping, it is like getting one box of 100 count Germ X Wipes for what used to be the price of buying two boxes when they were sold in the Sam's Club stores.	&&&
Awesome wipes and fit well into your purse!	&&&
"I started using it from past 1 year and they are very effect"	&&&
I received Seventh Generation wipes free to try. I am so happy that I had the opportunity. My toddler has pretty sensitive skin so I am pretty particular about the products I use. These wipes did not disappoint. He didn't experience any irritation at all which pleases me beyond words. The wipes worked well and it is very assuring that they aren't made with anything dangerous like parabens, etc. I really don't have anything negative to say at all about these wipe s. I highly recommend them! A+++	&&&
Husband loves these for use at the office. He keeps them in his desk drawer, and when needed, fits discreetly in his pocket. Said he really appreciates me buying them, they're making a huge difference while away from home. At home, he uses the medicated wipes from Preparation H.	&&&
I love this brand of wipes. Not only do they work well, they smell good. I'm able to save some money by using this brand and have them delivered on a subscription plan for free. AWESOME!!!1	&&&
I've tried them all and this is the only brand of wipes I'll use! They do not tear like the others.	&&&
I use these for bathroom wipes, and they don't make me itch as much as cheap store wipes, but they still make me itch some. These wipes might be a good place to start, but you could probably find better.	&&&
This product is great! My grandson doesn't mind his diaper changed now that the wipes are warm.	&&&
"I received this product in a Target subscription box. I was excited to use it. I used it plus some new products a few times and I got an allergic reaction on my face and neck. Unsure of which product caused this reaction I stopped using all. However reaction (big red itchy hives) lasted weeks and concerned me enough to head to Doctor where I got a prescription for extra strength cortisone.

After it all cleared up I was fine. Last night I used the simple wipes again and a few hours later (while in bed) my forehead began to itch and by morning smaller hives were forming. Definitely the culprit of my initial allergy.

Luckily I could put my prescription cream on to counteract. Gonna toss these and stick with Yes to Cucumbers.

Good luck."	&&&
Boys liked them.	&&&
Great item but does not dispense well	&&&
Good seller and a useful product. Little steep on the price tho	&&&
Use for everyone in the family. We keep reordering. Happy with them and cheap in compatible to other brands	&&&
"I was running out of wipes for my son and decided to give these a try. The following are my thoughts:

**Pros:
1. Touch - What I like about pampers wipes is that they much softer than huggies. My son has been experiencing a lot of diaper rash so wiping him up can be at times painful. The pampers are much more gently on his bottom.
2. Quality - The wipes are of thicker quality. Especially for the big messes, having a thicker wipe is advantageous. They do not break apart when wiping.

**Cons:
1. Smell - These wipes have the baby fresh smell as stated on the box. Although I like the smell, I do think that it is a little strong for my son. I appreciate it when we have the big messes but for every day clean up, I think I prefer a lighter smell. As a note, the smell does eventually goes away but I do feel the initial smell is strong.
2. Packaging - Other pampers wipes that I ordered have the ability of use the wipes packaging as it own container. For these wipes, you have to already have a container for since there is no dispenser flap built in. I would prefer that there was some built in dispenser so I can just grab the pack to go.

Although I like pamper wipes, I am going to opt for a different option for my next order."	&&&
Works great, but it is a little heavy.	&&&
Never had to try another brand, these are perfect. Can be used on face and hands without leaving sticky or greasy residue.	&&&
To be honest, I was a bit skeptical of moisturizing wipes. I live in Colorado where I have chronically dry skin. However, I was pleasantly surprised by them, cheap (3$ for a pack of 16). After I wash my face I use one and my skin is soft and clearer. Definitely a good product to try out!	&&&
These are the only wipes that I use. Every other type that I have tried, I have been unhappy with. These are soft and do not irritate my baby's sensitive skin. A must-have	&&&
Not as nice as the Cottonelle wipes and dry out much quicker.	&&&
nice quality mop covers - sturdy elastic fit.	&&&
Never fail me	&&&
Love, love, love these disinfecting wipes! They have a great fresh scent and they always come in handy. Highly recommend this product.	&&&
I have been buying these wipes for almost a year now for my son and will never use anything else for him! When he was a newborn I had tried the cheaper wipes and they all gave him diaper rash because he has extremely sensitive skin, plus they were so dry. Even the sensitive skin wipes were no match for the natural care wipes! I recommend these wipes to everyone I know, and even strangers in the store, and I wouldn't even think twice to use anything different on my son! We ca n use them on his bottom, face hands, clothes, and furniture and it doesn't leave a scent or a rash!	&&&
very thin wipes. disappointed in quality for the price.	&&&
These arrived before expected and have solved our problem beautifully. Our older dog is experiencing incontinence issues so we needed a product that kept floors and furniture clean.	&&&
All of pampers wipes are fantastic. They have wipes to meet every need and to fit every infant/child. These are another great product!	&&&
I like that there's no scent, nothing's worse than the smell of perfume mixed with...Ehem....baby smell! I use these wipes to clean the baby after eating, wipe his tray down, as well as, of course, the usual! I'm a fan!	&&&
It's like using a very soft cloth on their bottoms.	&&&
My wife and I swear by One and DOne baby wipes...after trying several others, they are never as durable/thick. I'm not a huge fan of the scented wipes, but it is not strong smelling.	&&&
Bought from Amazon Warehouse. Advertised as coming in original packaging with all accessories. It did not. Looked very used, and only the wash position worked. On vacuum and dry positions the motor was running but there was zero suction, so I had to use a mop to get the water up that was put on the floor. The bonus hard wipes mentioned and the manual, and floor cleaning solution were not included in the packaging or lack thereof. At least Amazon has a great return policy, so it cost me nothing but my time.	&&&
I mainly use these cloths to wipe my face after a sweaty workout and they work great for that purpose. It cleans my skin and helps deter the breakouts that I get when I let sweat sit on my face. If you workout a lot, this is a great product for you. "	&&&
Thi!s is a great buy	&&&
These wipes are well worth their money! They don't clump up or fall apart like other brands. Only one comes out at a time and you almost always only need one. Even the tough, messy jobs still only need two! Very happy with all pampers products.	&&&
This is such a good product. Whether you are using it for a baby or for your art studio it keeps the wipes damp for ages and is easy to use one-handed.	&&&
I love these wipes to keep my kitchen literally "clean". Not only it disinfects surfaces but everything shines after cleaning which I appreciate. It also clears greecy areas which is very common for Indian cooking. I always recommend it to my family and friends. Give it a try.	&&&
These wipes work well.The labels says you can clean glass but it leaves a cloudy residue.	&&&
If I could give this a product 5 additional stars I would. I have to have these clorox wipes in my home especially with two kids. I use these wipes on my walls, table, and counters.	&&&
They are not perfect, and may take some getting used to using, but they do work.	&&&
These are great wipes- they are gentle on the skin but tough on the mess! These wipes are different than the other pampers wipes by the Baby Fresh scent- which is really just a glorified way of saying baby powder. I dislike the scent but I am not a fan of baby powder anyways. I would recommend getting these wipes if scents don't bother you or you like baby powder scent. Sometimes I buy these because they are cheaper than other pampers wipes- they feel the same and do the same job as t he other wipes. Only difference I found was the smell.	&&&
These face wipes work really well to remove dirt and makeup. They don't irrate my dry, sensitive skin and have a light, clean smell. They are my new go-to makeup remover!	&&&
I would highly recommend pampers wipes to any one of my friend, to anyone. They don't tear when you try to get them out, they wipe off easily, they smell great!! By my experience they are by far the best wipes and diapers out there.	&&&
This product is just perfect my son hated having his nose cleaned or wiped. But once we starting using the grape boogie wipes he had no problem with us cleaning his nose. The wipes are soft so it doesnt irratate babies skin and the great smell is perfect gives our son something good to look forward to while we clean his nose. I would tell every mom to try this with their babies and toddlers.	&&&
"I keep a pouch in my car, in the diaper bag and one in the house. I Love them for runny noses and/or crusty noses for my little one. They're gentle and work Great!"	&&&
Excellent wipes. My silver service looks like new. I highly recommend them for anyone. tThe Silver servce set is used as a centerpeice in my Dining Room anns is admired by vivitors to my home.	&&&
Good for fast/daily cleaning. Had to go over some muddy paw prints on tile floor in kitchen to get it all up. Vac mode not that strong but it will get the dust and pet hair. Dryer: Well, it doesn't dry completely but it does shorten the time.	&&&
"These washcloths from Brooklyn Bamboo are probably some of my favorites in a long time. The only complaint I have is they are a little on the pricey side. But when you buy organic you have to expect to pay a little more. I just had to get that out of the way, since I know that will be a big concern for shoppers.
Now, let me tell you why I love these bamboo washcloths.
1. They're soft. They are microfiber soft. They are perfect for dry-wiping your baby's face as they won't irritate skin like regular terry cloth might.
2. They are just the right size and thickness for me. This is probably a matter of preference, and it is also the biggest reason I like these washcloths. They are bigger than many baby washcloths, but smaller and thinner than regular washcloths. I actually dislike using regular washcloths, because by the time I scrunch it up in my hand, like when washing dishes, it feels so big and bulky in my hand and makes my fingers less maneuverable. I definitely prefer the thinner feel of this washcloth. These are about a square inch less in size than my other washcloths.
3. They are multi-purpose. These make great baby wipes if you are using cloth diapers. I tend to use baby washcloths for cloth wipes and sometimes feel they're a little small for the job. These are just right, are easier to grip and tend to get more mess. These also make good face washing cloths and cleaning cloths. Pretty much anything you'd use regular washcloths for, these could be used for.
If you are like me and have trouble finding the happy medium between baby washcloth and regular washcloths, you will want to consider these!
I was given a set of these for my review, but these are my own honest opinions and experiences with the product."	&&&
I liked the price of this product, but, the overall quality just isn't there. Other brands that cost more are much, much more gentle and so I won't buy these again.	&&&
This really works quite well. It goes on very easily and does not feel greasy. The resulting shine lasts for a good many weeks, up to 6 weeks, before requiring a touch up. You also avoid overspray when using these wipes. Which, in my book, is a definite plus!! The application of this product is fast and easy. I would recommend this product to anyone that likes that detailed look with little efefort.	&&&
Use the wipes for everything. Came damaged when shipped, buy in store	&&&
I love these wipes!! These last a long time and dont bother my babys butt.	&&&
Love these wipes. I use these wipes to remove my makeup daily. No irritation on my face. It removes my mascara and eye liner easily with no residue. Love these wipes so much. I bought these wipes on a deal using coupon.	&&&
i used to use this to store cotonelle wipes, until I learned even flushable wipes can cause sewage issues over time. I love this container though. So now I use it to hold neutropenia makeup wipes they fit perfectly and don't dry out anymore.	&&&
I Love the convenient individual packaging and the thickness of these Sani-wipes and how clean it makes my hands feel. Great to have at all times! Will definitely be buying more.	&&&
I've used these for awhile and am very happy with them. Better than gawd knows what chemicals even the so-called "green" wipes contain and they work just as well.	&&&
I absolutely LOVE this product. I was using another brand of makeup wipes before and they were not only burning my eyes but my whole face. I saw these on the website and stopped in by my local Bare Minerals store to buy them. They do not burn my eyes nor my face it also removes makeup very very well. Even my mascara! I used one sheet on my face then cleansed it with the Deep Cleansing Foam followed by Purely Nourishing Moisturizer: Combination Skin also by Bare Minerals. My face does not burn or itch and my eyes feel great. Another great thing about this product is that it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. It just feels clean. VERY happy with this product. I will continue to use it!!	&&&
I no longer bathe my baby son, I now solely use these wipes.	&&&
I bought these wipes to use on my 2007 dodge. The headlights were in good shape but they were completely yellow. Nevertheless, this was the best 4 bucks I've spent in a long time. I was so impressed and I would recommend this product to anyone.	&&&
I suffer from the disease IBS which means I have uncontrollable diarrhea sometimes explosive getting all over my behind these wipes are wonderful. They hold up to messy clean ups are extremely strong & flush easily. For anyone who has an illness like this or a baby these would work well.	&&&
"I keep it plugged in all the time! Wipes are always warm & moist! I've been using it for 4 months now. Baby loves it! I actually might love it more than my baby bc it's nice fort hands to not have to use a cold wipe during cold nights!!"	&&&
I loved the texture of these and they were so promising til they gave both my kiddos a new diaper rash. They seem like really nice, strong wipes, but something in them (the sensitive ones) was irritating my kids' skin. If your kids have sensitive skin, stick with huggies natural/unscented or 7th generation. Be sure to buy the ones with a pop top - NOT the ones with a sticker. The sticker never sticks and the wipes dry out. These amazon ones have a pop top which I loved, but it's not gonna work out... :( - a side note - the sensitive ARE unscented, which I couldn't figure out until we got them.	&&&
My absolute favourite cloth wipes - these are thick and soft and clean even the grossest diapers with only one. We loved them so much we bought more packs - these are the only wipes we use. I give them as gifts to mamas who are interested in using cloth. They have been used every day for 18+months and have zero stains and are still in amazing condition. Highly recommend	&&&
"Brooklyn Bamboo Baby Washcloths are a must-have for newborns. Great for new mommies as gifts. So versatile. I can use to clean off dirty hands and face, moisten and use when diaper rash is really bad. In the bathtub with mild baby soap or as a 'cowboy wash' for newborns that still have their belly button attached and can't have a wet bath yet. Each order comes with six washcloths. Two yellow, two while and two light blue. They are organic and since they are bamboo they are super soft. I know these say they are for babies but we also have another use for them. My grandma is 79-years-old and her skin is tender. She likes to use these when she bathes since they are soft and gentle on her skin. There is enough to last several days without having to rush and do laundry too.
*I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."	&&&
I use these daily with an oil moisturizing routine, before I go to bed. They are nothing short of AMAZING. My skin has not been breaking out,It cleans off my minimal makeup, and it GLOWS. I've gotten so many compliments on it! I'm not really sensitive to smells, so I can't comment on that. But I do know my skin looked awful when I switched brands. HOWEVER, I will say that with hyaluronic acid, it WILL NOT work unless you give it something to draw in moisture. So you either must moisturize afterwards, or apply to wet skin (which defeats the purpose of the wipes lol). So pick up a good oil (Derma e has great ones)and apply to keep your skin super glowy and moisturized. Plus this is great for the price- just wish they came in packs of 30!	&&&
"LYSOL WIPES ARE GREAT TO USE AROUND THE HOUSE AND OFFICE TO REMOVE GERMS AND MAKE THE AREAS CLEAN. WE WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT THEM FOR OUR OFFICE TO KEEP GERMS AWAY."	&&&
Nice to have in the diaper bag but the wipes could be a little bigger	&&&
so glad to have these. they are now in my car, purse, sitting room, beside table and anywhere else I could stick them!	&&&
"The Clorox Brand is like no other. You don't notice the difference until you purchase a GENERIC BRAND of Bleach and Bleach Cleaners That you see what a MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.
BY ALL MEANS IT'S WORTH THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GERNIC NAME AN THE CLOROX NAME"	&&&
My wife and I have been using Huggies Natural Care Wipes since our son was born 6 months ago now. We have not had any problems with them and recommend them to anyone. We've experienced only minimal diaper rash, and that's only been when our son's butt was still wet when we put his diaper on.	&&&
Pampers wipes are the best kind out there. It gets the job done with one wipe. And eliminates odor! They are perfect for my sensitive newborns bottom.	&&&
Love these! These wipes really clean, kill nasty germs, and leave my car smelling great! Will definitely keep these on hand now and in the future.	&&&
I love these wipes! They work great and easy to just grab and go! I use them regularly.	&&&
"We use these daily, one place or another, as part of our cleaning routine. They work well for bathrooms, kitchens, and pretty much anywhere you want to clean and disinfect. They have enough fluid to be useful but not so much that they drip.

While you might prefer one of the available scents to the others, I've found them all to be equally unoffending, so I suspect you'd be fine with either of them. Well, maybe I might prefer the orange a bit, followed by the citrus, but it's not a strong preference. I've never tried the lavender.

Note that you can also bring these while traveling to wipe down the room - it's a great and quick way to help reduce the chance of catching something that might be going around locally.

It's also nice - if you have the space, and especially if you have kids - to keep some in the car.

Were I to request one change, it'd be to make them a bit rougher - they clean well, but they do a less efficient job of pulling the larger items (crumbs, hair, other grossities) along with the wipe, and often I'll end up needing a paper towel or similar to finish. For dust, dirt, and other small things, this isn't an issue."	&&&
I love the scent of these wipes. They are very durable when your cleaning up after a poop. Ive had wipes rip on me while cleaning a bum is not very pleasant.	&&&
"We are first time parents that wanted something gentle for our baby's bottom. These wipes are perfect. They are soft, odor-free, and my now 6 week old has yet to have any rashes or raw-ness.
The one inconvenience is that they don't always pull out of the box and bring the next wipe with them, and it is tough to pull the sections apart."	&&&
"""Eating time

Sick time

Freshen up time to go out time"""	&&&
These wipes work well for sensitive skin.	&&&
The Clorox disinfecting wipes are awesome! I use mine to clean kitchen counters, bathroom sinks and toilets! I trust them.	&&&
I love these clorox wipes, not only do they smell amazing they are durable and great for scrubbing as well !	&&&
I have pets and sometimes they make messes. I was pleasantly surprised how well these wipes cleaned up the spot the mess left behind. You can't even tell there was ever a clean up in that area!	&&&
No diaper rashes since we started using these.	&&&
I bought them for someone else, and she loves them. As such, would recommend.	&&&
These wipes are a really great size and are adequately moistened. I have found that one wipe works just fine to take off an entire face of makeup, including waterproof mascara and eyeliner.	&&&
I don't know how this product only has 3 stars, these are definitely the best makeup wipes I have used. They really take it all off and leave your skin feeling great!	&&&
love, love, love this huge box of wipes. I love that you get so many and I do not need to order or buy anymore wipes for at least a few months. And it was cheaper than buying them at walmart	&&&
great wipes at a great price	&&&
I use these everyday at work. The maintenance guys have to use my computer to punch in and out. Guess what they have all sorts of germs and grime I need to exterminate from my desk and keyboard. So these handy little wipes do the trick! They make everything clean, fresh and prepare me to get to work!	&&&
I recently became a mom of my first little one 3months ago, I have tried different brands , but these work the best, they are gentle enough for my babies bottom & they do the job without causing a rash, I have boughten these and refill them as I go (so I keep the plastic container & buy refills for it :))	&&&
I love clorox wipes for disinfecting my sons toys and keeping them sanitized but I do not like using them for counters. They dont seem to pick up all the extras and can dry out quickly if the lid is left off for too long	&&&
These are great wipes, they are thick and also does well in a wipe warmer. Very gentle on baby skin.	&&&
Easy to use for children. Also, these wipes do not clog your toilet or sewage system! Gives a great clean.	&&&
My fingers break through the wipes while changing my baby's diaper. I used one once to wipe my face and the corner of my eyes starting burning almost immediately. We are switching to pampers sensitive wipes to see how they are.	&&&
"This may sound clich? but I am astounded by these washcloths. My experience with baby washcloths boils down to products that are thin, flimsy, scratchy, and small. I normally avoid baby washcloths all together and just use a one of our regular size. The problem with this is I wash my daughter’s laundry in different detergent/softener than what I use for my laundry.

Brooklyn Bamboo Washcloths to the rescue!

As soon as I removed the first washcloth from the package I smiled because I knew this wasn’t the type of product that I feared receiving. It was squishy soft and as I unrolled it I noticed that it is much larger than most baby washcloths. Measuring 10” x 10” these washcloths are close to a standard washcloth but not quite. After running the washcloths through the wash I noticed that they actually felt softer than when they originally were unpackaged.

More importantly, this product is hypoallergenic and organic. As the mommy of a little one that has extremely sensitive skin we have to be very careful about the products we introduce to our home. As one can imagine, soaps, baby washes, shampoo, washcloths etc… can result in red, irritated skin that causes rashes, bumps, itching, and often crying. Since we introduced the Brooklyn Bamboo Washcloths our little one has actually incorporated them into her playtime while in the tub. This is a definite winner in mommy’s book.

This product is perfect for baby and parents. They also prove to be the perfect baby shower or welcome home gift as washcloths/wipes come in general neutral, natural colors: light bamboo green, natural off white, and natural light yellow.

Brooklyn Bamboo offers one of the softest baby products that this momma has been introduced to; especially in the realm of washcloths. And let’s not forget, all products are hypoallergenic and organic.

Brooklyn Bamboo products are perfect for homes that are looking to add a touch of green, have little ones with sensitive skin, love bamboo, or simply love soft and luxurious products. We love our washcloths!

I love these wipes! A great price and I really like the ingredient list. No harsh chemicals. These are a must have in the house.	&&&
Love these things, especially when traveling. Sorry my store stopped carrying these items.	&&&
I love buying Clorox wipes because it makes it easy for my kids to understand the value of being part of a family when they help clean around the house with them.	&&&
always buy the pop tops pampers wipes, this box has the regular sticky flap, its a pain to open when you're busy changing diapers. Other wise they are the same wipes, work well on sensitive skin and don't irritate.	&&&
Great brand, very thick and the refill pack allowed us to keep the same tub and just add more wipes.	&&&
"""This is a good product and I use it at home, office.........

Easy, clean

One piece will clean a lot."""	&&&
Every DUDE should be carrying one	&&&
Nothing like being able to clean up after using the bathroom! I keep them at work and at home...along with the convenience of being able to flush these, you can't go wrong. I also use them for had wipes when I'm unable to wash my hands, all in all, a great product!	&&&
The ONLY wipes I will use! No residue, I only need to use one, MAYBE two with a really poopy diaper. They are soft, leave baby's skin soft and clean, and they don't tear like other kinds do. DEFINITELY get these!	&&&
I tried many other brands of wipes with my first daughter and I eventually settled on Pampers Sensitive Wipes. I loved them so much I also use them exclusively for my second daughter. They are gentle on their sensitive skin, tough enough to handle big messes and gentle to the touch. There is no potentially skin irritating fragrance on these wipes and my daughters have not shown any allergic reaction to them at all. They are high quality and definitely worth buying.	&&&
Let me just say that I don't use these on children. I'm a grown adult who has been using these for years for the additional hygienic cleaning. I found the other non-natural adult versions, cottenelle wipes, etc. to have so many chemicals in them that they are a skin irritant. I highly recommend adults alike to use these wipes, chlorine free makes a huge difference!	&&&
This is not as good as Lysol. Very thin wipes . Not recommend.	&&&
"I received this product at a discounted price for a honest review.
These wipes are not that wet but they work great. You did not leave any marks behind and wiped up all the smears on my glasses. I recommend these to anyone looking for cleaning wipes for glasses or a screen for a cheap price."	&&&
Works well except wipes get stuck in dispenser sometimes	&&&
Amazing and left me dingleberry free!!	&&&
Husband loves these. Not only is it a hilarious gift, but they're very practical and comfortable to use too.	&&&
I really like these wipes. My skin is very sensitive and prone to painful redness. I originally tried Yes To Cucumber wipes, which left a weird film on my face and burned. I use the Aveeno Ultra Calming lotion, and really like that, so I was excited to find these wipes. The smell is pleasant, it doesn't leave a film, and it doesn't irritate my skin. I don't wear tons of makeup, just a light powder foundation with eyeliner and mascara, and one wipe is enough to take all my makeup off. Happy with my purchase, and I will order again!	&&&
I used the wipes on my problem areas, (Forehead, back of neck, behind ears) places that I get random breakouts, and I notice it allowed my normal cleansers to work much better since the dead skin was wiped away. I have even used it on my elbows and knuckles to get rid of the dead skin on those joints.	&&&
New to this product. Using nightly to remove my minimum makeup before moisturizing for the night. Could maybe use a smaller sheet.	&&&
I was looking for an alcohol-free sanitizing wipe that was individually wrapped. I used to purchase Germ-X wipes but can no longer find them at an affordable price. The Babyganics wipes fit the bill perfectly. They have a pleasant fragrance and aren't too "soapy." I actually prefer these to a lot of other brands I have tried.	&&&
these are my favorite wipes and I use them everyday on my baby. They are so fresh and gentle.	&&&
Love these boogie wipes for my kids. They smell great and they do a very good job on cleaning them noses. Especially when the allergy season gets here. I always carry these with me.	&&&
Cleaned the cat well... Right up until he tried cleaning himself off and puked. Used it again the next week. Same results. The wipes didn't make him sick. He was clean, but he hated it on him so he over leaned himself. Hence the massive hair balls to clean up. Threw the rest away.	&&&
Great product! Work in a very dusty environment and couldn't be without these wipes."}},	&&&
The best wipes Pampers has to offer your precious little one!	&&&
I love my FloorMate. Most of my flooring is either hardwood or ceramic. This has been a great purchase. Especially for my hardwood. I really feel like the floor is getting clean and I love, love, love, that I don't have to get the vacuum and mop out separately to clean. It's a time saver. And it dries the floor too! It's one of the best purchases I've made.	&&&
Huggins baby wipes are the best, hands down. Always better than pampers.	&&&
Love these! Scent is perfect! Most wipes I buy in bulk I start to get sick of the smell, not these. Absolutely love them. No residue left behind either, so good for faces and hands too.	&&&
Such a bummer. These aren't folded so that they "feed" from our wipes warmer. Such a shame since they're all natural and safe for baby. Just wish they worked better for us.	&&&
These wipes are great, thick and soft. Have to be careful not to order the gentle wipes as packaging is same. The smaller gentle wipes are thin and better for removing make-up, not cleaning baby's bottom. For some reason every six wipes or so they are really stuck together so you have to rip apart so a little frustrating there.	&&&
Does not keep the wipes warm at all. Save your money and do not buy this. You get better results by running the wipe under warm water. Much better wipe warmers out there, this is not one. Should be removed from the market. Babies R Us should be ashamed for selling this junk.	&&&
In the k iddle of the night when baby wakes up for a change, this item is great as it keeps the wipes warm n soothes baby without the cold jolt of a wipe. Nice n easy for baby to fall back asleep. Happy mom here	&&&
We have been using these for years and these are the best wipes we have found for our babies. They clean really well, are sturdy, and are a great price.	&&&
Much less convenient because wipes just loosely thrown into baggie. Lack of fold-out box, or any box, makes product much less convenient to store or to have readily available than product with box. Recommend only to buy the version where box is shown and included.	&&&
Once this kind of baby wipes came out I fell in love with it. The smell of the refreshing cucumber smells so good and the price and how much you get in the package is so worth it. I've been using this kind for almost a year.	&&&
Ever since Puffs ruined their Puffs Plus Lotion product a few years back, I have been searching for something that would not cause chapped skin around my nose when I have a cold. These are a bit more expensive, but they are perfect if you need to blow your nose a lot and want to avoid the pain of irritated skin!	&&&
"Could someone tell me are you supposed to grab the initial wipe to feed through the hole in the lid from the inside of the 40-wipe roll -- or from the outside?

The instructions are not clear on this point. I cannot get the next wipe to come through after I pull the exposed wipe from the canister. I always have to open the lid to grab the next wipe, which is very frustrating."	&&&
These sensitive skin wipes are soft and very moist. They last well for clean-ups without easily tearing. The price is good and I will re-order.	&&&
They are too small, difficult to remove from package, and while I did not try flushing them, I think they would cause problems. There are much better wipes for sale.	&&&
works well.	&&&
I prefer these wipes if using a wet wipe, though I prefer dry wipe that I wet myself because I believe they are gentler on the skin. Sometimes though I do not have access to water so I keep this on hand.	&&&
Received broken plastic wipes case	&&&
My husband and I have both used many hemmorrhoidal products over the years but this product is by far at the top of the list. We have found it to be soothing, cleansing, disposible and easily packed for travel. The price can't be beat. Save even more now that it is available in a double pack.	&&&
I keep one of these pouches in my diaper bag and the larger tub in my house. These wipes clean runny noses without leaving that white residue that regular wipes may leave on runny noses.	&&&
These are fabulous wipes. Very thick and sturdy!!!	&&&
Great product!	&&&
I love these the container makes them super easy to use and they last a really long time I buy them at the wholesale club so the price is good and they last a long time"	&&&
I bought these for my leather couch. They work very well, but I need to use several as the moisture disappears. But I think that is to be expected.	&&&
so easy to use!!! I'm a full time mom and need to spot clean every day. These wipes really make my day easier.	&&&
Love these wipes! I am able to use less quantity for messy toddler diapers because of their quality. Great subscribe and save deal too!	&&&
I am spoiled to these and hate if I have to use any other wipe. They are soft, yet sturdy. I hate the sensitive ones that slide right through the mess. I love these things for poolside, spills, runny noses, etc.	&&&
I love using these disinfecting wipes! They are great for a quick clean up and I bring them when I travel to disinfect!!	&&&
No bad odor or stickiness after use, cleans well. Does occasionally when pulling from plastic tub.	&&&
"I'm generally a huge fan of Amazon-branded products, so I was excited to try these. Unfortunately, I really dislike these. They don't even come close to my current brand of wipes (Costco's Kirkland brand). I've tried about half a pack trying to like them and it's just not happening.

1. They are not wet enough. At first I thought they were just drying out, but even after pulling a few sheets, they still felt too dry.
2. You always get multiple wipes when you try to pull one out.
3. It takes multiple wipes to clean any type of real mess because they just don't seem to work well.

These are going back."	&&&
love these wipes. and the price is accurate to my surrounding stores.	&&&
These are my favorite Wipes. My babies bottoms are sensitive and they break out easily but these Wipes are gentle and fragrance free so it doesn't irritate baby's bottoms. I would recommend this product to everyone with sensitive skin!	&&&
Soft, pliable, sturdy, quiet bags. They're great!!	&&&
Buy for price	&&&
I do not like the way it smell on my puppy and it is a little to dry (wipes	&&&
It was good to find a nice big bag of these!	&&&
The best thing every! We use everywhere, even in the cars. Must always keep stock in these wipes!!	&&&
I feel like i only want to use pampers wipes They're gentle for my babys butt.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes all the time. They are easy and get the job done quickly. I even have some at work and use them to clean my desk everyday.	&&&
Throw away the boxes that the wipes come in, because you will never want to use them again. This device is easy to use, sturdy, compact, and fits any kinds of wipes, meaning you can buy the wipes in bulk as well. It does NOT heat them or do anything special, but it is easy to use, even the little kids can use after a trial or two. It dispenses regularly and easily. I plan to give these out as baby gifts, forever. They are also heavy enough that they don't slide easily off the toilet back when you grab one, and are sturdy enough to be cleaned well on their outsides...as needed, which is frequently if you need wipes!	&&&
Great buy	&&&
Irritates skin.	&&&
really good !! Thanks	&&&
The Clorox Citrus Disinfecting Wipes smells GREAT!!!! They clean and deodorize as good at the original Clorox Wipes, which is a plus.	&&&
Love the wipes. The scent, the thickness and the durability get the job done!	&&&
LOVE these washcloths! So soft and beautiful quality!! Would absolutely order more!!!!	&&&
I love these wipes and they work wonderfully on my grandchild whose allergies are real bad.  	&&&
I love these wipes for many reasons, one they are much better on my babys skin then other harsher wipes, they also don't rip in half like huggies wipes do. They came in perfect condition and exactly what is shown in picture at a great price and brought right to your door how can you go wrong!	&&&
I recently purchased these wipes and highly recommend them. They do not contain perfumes or any irritants, and have not caused and allergic reactions. I was only going to use these for travel, but now I use them daily! Good product.	&&&
Good strong wipes just wish they smelled better.	&&&
Sunscreen wipes are awesome! Makes life so much easier and these have a nice scents and feels nice and soft on the skin, unlike traditional sunscreen.	&&&
I love these disinfecting wipes. They are really convenient for cleaning and disinfecting my kitchens and bathrooms. They have a nice scent, too. I order them regularly through the Subscribe and Save program!	&&&
These can remove eye makeup without irritating sensitive skin, and the cloths don't dry out. These qualities have been difficult for me to find in one cleansing cloth.	&&&
These wipes are pretty much my favorite along with Amazon bran wipes. They are better than the Amazon wipes in scent because its not too strong, has a really clean cucumber aroma, and they are cheaper. However, they are not as strong as the Amazon wipes and I tend to like the texture of the Amazon wipes better as well. So really depends on what you are looking for in a wipe for your baby. Awesome wipes!	&&&
Love these wipes, they are so easy to use and keep the kitchen and bathroom looking good when time is short.	&&&
I ordered these wipes because they were on sale. I normally use the Target brand wipes, and I love them. With the price being such a great deal on the elements wipes, I figured to give them a try. I must say I am very impressed. There is no smell, they are thick and don't tear, the texture of them is perfect. I like them so much I am going to switch from my normal brand ;)	&&&
Great product, ordering again right now!	&&&
I love these wipes. They leave my face feeling fresh, not tight and dried out.	&&&
I don't like them. The package is hard to tear open and if you try and tear a wipe in half, it won't even tear. I certainly wouldn't want to flush them down my toilet, they would never fall apart.	&&&
Decided to try these out, very happy with the quality and how well they work. So convenient to have delivered to my door. Will be repurchasing.	&&&
These wipes are excellent and at such a great price. They smell so good and clean well.	&&&
The compact size of the packaging is really nice to have especially when on the go. The wipes are comfortable to use and strong so they won't tear easily. Finally...relief	&&&
I am a first time mom. I have 4 step children but there ages 6 to 16, So when it comes to babies she was a learning experience. I have very sensitive skin in which my daughter inherited. I was using regular wipes, cheap wipes or whatever i got from my baby shower and i noticed that they where making her bottom very raw to the point of bleeding. I went to the dr and she told me that the wipes where to harsh on her skin. She suggested wet paper towels which worked but was a lot of work when we needed to change her. Until i did some research. I found that the natural care wipes where perfect no alcohol or fragrances. I tried it and I haven't had a problem since. I'm so glad because I hate seeing her in pain. I definitely recommend this product!!!!!	&&&
"Love these diapers for my little yorkie!!!! The only draw back is your pricing for the amount you get in one bag. It's not unusual to go through several a day when training a puppy so probably won't order again because of cost/amount in your bags. I will just have to continue using homemade/pads.
Thank you Beth"	&&&
I feel as if these are the best hand wipes because of the alcohol.	&&&
Great	&&&
I don't care for these wipes. They felt to slimy.	&&&
Perfect. Arrived much earlier than advised!	&&&
Love the wipes"}},	&&&
I am always using baby wipes for my kids ad other things now that both of them are out of diapers i am still buying them I like to still use these to keep in the car and to keep around the house for easy cleanups on the go and easy cleanups of the kids faces and also easy cleanups around the house. I like this large box of wipes since they will last me quite a while less I have to worry about running out of wipes so fast.The huggies wipes are soft and easy on the skin there is no strong smell to these wipes ethier. Overall i have used huggies since my kids were babys and I still use them now that they are out of diapers.	&&&
Love Love Love this Wipes for multi-purpose, from my baby to personal hygiene.	&&&
"cleans mask just fine but is hard to get out of the container.
Soap and water works just as well so I'm not sure I'll buy it again."	&&&
I did not find them satisfactory. 1st problem was taking them out of the package. They are quite flimsy and tear even taking them out for use. I understand the need for "flushability" but the texture and strength were not good. Second issue, I don't like the scent. Smells a little spoiled or like alcohol. The scent was not pleasant. Third issue was likely one of allergy. The lengthy list of ingredients does not mention alcohol but there was a definite stinging. I do not recommend. It is also likely on me as I did not really consider the reviews before.	&&&
cleans great	&&&
Great product. Great price. Quick delivery. I have bought other disinfecting wipes, but I prefer Lysol. They were extremely economical and very convenient to order.	&&&
It's not recommended to use a wipes warmer, because the wipes cool considerably in the short distance from the warmer to your baby's bottom. We bought it though, because we live in a basement that doesn't stay warm in the winter. This helped keep the wipes from being biting cold. In a home with proper heating don't bother. In our situation it helps.	&&&
The Quick Review: Fairly priced, delivered straight to your door, these wipes do what you expect: clean and disinfect with in a handy, disposable manner. Mega-sized to last a long time -- unless you are a germaphobe -- this pack is best for households that are big or full of people. That, or leave one in the office, one in the car, and another one in the kitchen!	&&&
These are good wipes. They are bulk wipes (they come in 3 large bags and you fill your own dispenser) but are a good deal considering that extra effort.	&&&
Great price for so many baby wipes! Good quality too.	&&&
Nice but not as wet as the ones in the small packs	&&&
Just adopted an English Bulldog and these wipes are essential to keeping folds clean. The smell of the wipes was VERY off putting at first, but I guess I'm use to it now. Great price and easy to use.	&&&
Compare to other brand, it did not meet my expectation.	&&&
This scent is night and not so "baby powder" smelling. I liked it because it had a scent but was still gentle enough for my baby. The toughness of the actual fabric was great too!	&&&
Great condition. Great price!	&&&
The wipes were a little dryer than i expected but they seemed to still clean my face very well. Had to wipe a few times (using same cloth) to get my waterproof mascara off but it did finally come off. They smelled really nice and left my face feeling softer.	&&&
My new favorite wipes! Not as thin as Pampers and not as wet as Huggies.	&&&
Just what I needed	&&&
Definitely 5 star wipes. Each wipe is sealed in a small foil pack that can fit anywhere. They do not leave any streaks and when used dry fast. They are always moist... I have ordered 600 of them and was worried that they'd dry out over time but they never did (stayed as moist as when I first bought them)! I use them primarily for my eyeglasses but have also occasionally used them to clean my computer and phone which they worked great with. I would recommend this product for anyone but especially for people with eyeglasses. I find that my eyeglasses smudge really easily and these are a great help!	&&&
"Love these wipes! Non-toxic and clean nicely. If you are seeking that typical baby wipe smell, these will not work out for you. As titled, water wipes. No fragrance, no harsh chemicals.

I used to buy from another site but now buy from here because it is a lot more affordable. Delivered fast. A+ all around."	&&&
These wipes are perfect for my sensitive eye area I use these wipes to remove all my makeup not just my eye makeup. This wipes are dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested, they are gentle on my skin but are still able to remove all my makeup very easily even my mascara and eyeliner which for me has always been the most difficult thing to remove when it comes to removing my makeup. I really like that these wipes contain Aloe which soothes the skin and green tea and vitamin E which contain antioxidants that protect the skin from free radical damage, and it's great that they are also fragrance free and alcohol free because that would always cause my skin to feel and look dry. After I Remove my make up with the wipes my skin just feels fresh and soft and looks brighter. I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or someone who wants some makeup remover wipes that will actually benefit their skin.	&&&
Have a can in the bathroom and the car and my desk drawer.... Love them! I have replaced the liquid hand sanitizer that people use all the time with these wipes.	&&&
So disappointed!!! Also thoroughly embarrassed!! I sent this to my sister. We've never had a problem with generic wipes before. If never tried them myself. After ordering her ANOTHER package ... She had to tell me to please stop sending them. They're useless & won't wipe away anything.... Let alone a poopy diaper. They're all going in the trash.	&&&
These are an essential to carry in your diaper bag or purse, especially when diaper wipes aren't exactly a necessity anymore but you still have a toddler that's prone to sticky hands!	&&&
Good wipes, good price on Amazon	&&&
My daughter has sensitive skin and I cant buy most off brands so I try to always buy Pampers since I know she has never broken out by using them. Not only do they not break her out but they work great as well. Some wipes rip when you use them or are so rough. I also loved the sent of these fresh wipes. I would defiantly buy these again.	&&&
Got these for a great deal on amazon love there coupons and with the us of promotions I've earn I payed very little and pampers is the best brand baby doesn't break out from them there soft and they smell good	&&&
may require more than 1 if you make a big mess.	&&&
These are the best disinfectant wipes I have ever used.	&&&
These are the worst wipes we have ever used. They rip EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Our local supermarket brand wipes are about a thousand times better. I bought these due to all the good reviews, so I felt compelled to come back and add to the pool. Do not buy these. You'll be stuck with a huge box of unusable product.	&&&
Does what you expect. Compressed air to clear out those air vents. Wipes to help clean the monitor. Not as good as other ones I have used.	&&&
Our veterinarian recommended this product for our dog’s stinky tears. It works and the dog is much more comfortable.	&&&
Much better than the original wipes that came with the mop! Carol Raizin	&&&
This thing is AMAZING! Half of the dispensers that come with the wipes suck. As new parents we were getting so frustrating digging for the wipes and then pulling out 18 at one time. I stumbled upon this by accident and I am so glad that I did. This thing has made diaper changes much more efficient an way less painful, ha. I will definitely be giving this for baby shower gifts. I strongly suggest this.	&&&
Love these wipes! My eyes feel so much better and look great. Thank you for making them convenient too. Easy to travel with and have anywhere.	&&&
I had the same problem that everyone else is writing about. Don't buy these wipes.	&&&
Very soft compared to other brands! Also durable, I use less wipes on dirty diapers than other brands.	&&&
To me personally the baby fresh wipes are the perfect wipes for a newborn, of course for any other baby, but they are so much more gentle than regular wipes.	&&&
Weiman Stainless STEEL wipes leave a streak-free shine on our stainless steel. Just wipe on, wait a couple of minutes and wipe off for a protective shine. I recommend Weiman Stainless Steel wipes.	&&&
My baby has very sensitive skin. Pampers sensitive wipes doesn't bother or dry out his skin at all!	&&&
It is an excellent, long lasting sunscreen. Weightless on the skin, no stickiness & does not drip into the eyes. My only preference would be for the wipes to be individually wrapped so that one does not have to carry the whole package of 20 wipes.	&&&
best way to buy diapers and wipes	&&&
Lid did not pop on ours. Returned	&&&
"This product used to be really great, but the recent change the manufacture made greatly reduced its quality. The wipes no longer clean up nearly as well as they used to, and they are smaller. About half size as before. The plastic lid on the containers is also much weaker than it used to be and is easily accidentally opened.

This would of been 5 stars for the old product, but the new version is no were near as good as the old one."	&&&
No issues here. They work well, do not irritate, and are pretty sturdy wipes.	&&&
great product for on the go. the wipes stay moist and it's easy to use. much better than 2 other wipe dispensers that I tried.	&&&
These wipes are very durable and so soft on my little ones bum. The large box has lasted me for a while and I love the prints on the small boxes & packages.	&&&
I love these wipes! Whenever my baby gets a diaper rash they are gentle and dont leave her butt really wet.	&&&
A few questionable ingredients. My kids fight their nose getting wiped with these. I have an easier time using honest company wipes instead.	&&&
I had no idea what to get when it came to wipes... I was a soon to be first time mom and clueless about what to buy. I figured "sensitive" would be the most gentle. My newborn seemed fine with these for a long time. It was a year of using them until I noticed irritation on my babies rear. ANother thing I noticed was they are super wet and slick. Kind of like they don't "grab" onto the yuck on your babys butt. meaning they take more wipes and wiping to get the job done. More wiping is never good. Maybe this lead to the irritation I was getting. As more and more food was being eaten by my baby, the poops became messier, and these simply did not do the job. They required 5-6 wipes, lots of wiping and they were causing irritation. One time my baby SCREAMED and jumped in pain when I wiped. Squirming in fear I would touch her w/ the wipe again. I looked down and little tiny spots of blood where I wiped were there. It was clearly painful and stinging. It was like she lost trust in me when changing her diaper. I felt terrible. For two months I used water and a washcloth, which was not always convenient. And often brought her into my shower. So I tried a sample pack of Huggies naturals, and they grabbed more- I used 2-3 wipes, and they seemed comfortable for her. I went to my baby advice support site where MANY women suggested Huggies naturals and some posted articles of pampers stinging and causing rashes and irritation. So weird how it seemed fine for a year and then stopped being okay. Not sure if the formula changed,.... or if as the consistency of poop changed, which made these wipes stop working. OR maybe I was just not realizing these stung all along and little one just didn't know how to start expressing herself til she was one. Made me feel like a bad mom. :'(	&&&
I use these several times a day as a stay at home mom on anything from my toddlers high chair to my counters to my toilet. I use them everywhere! I'm not really a clean freak but I love how Clorox Wipes make me feel like everything is clean and is so easy to use. I just grab one, wipe whatever it is I feel needs cleaned, and throw away. I'm obsessed! Not sure what I would do without these!	&&&
perfect gift and product,	&&&
These wipes are the best thing ever, no one likes a snotty nose and these wipes are soft and gentle. It makes it really easy to wipe a tiny nose and my grandson loves the Grape smell! I love them and there is nothing I don't like.	&&&
These are a great deal	&&&
"I purchased these not knowing if they would work well or not but can say I will purchase them again. I use them on my laptop and desktop screens and the wipes work wonderfully. Figured if they were OK fot the computer screens I would use them on the TV's as well. They cleaned my 3 flat screens better than when they were new. These little beauties will clean anything with a screen - phones, ipads, etc."	&&&
I bought these instead of the Pampers sensitive wipes because I had a coupon from Amazon. So far I think they are great. Very durable, and not quite as wet as the Pampers, which I like. They don't stick together as much as the Pampers, either.	&&&
Pampers makes the best wipes and diapers!	&&&
I have 3 kids and we have had a certian brand wipe for years that we use.... now we have these wipes and love them! smell great, don't tear so you get poop on your hands, and just the right amount of wet/dry so it doesn't act like toilet paper or a wet towel!!! its like goldie locks and the 3 bears - except with wipes. it's like using a fairly tale to wipe your heiny (or your kids heiny)... just try them - I think they are 100% money back garauntee? seriously folks... good stuff here! me likes!	&&&
These work great for washing my face and removing makeup, and I just toss them in the trash after. I also used them to remove nail polish.	&&&
I have tried a variety of cleansing wipes and different brands, and these are by far my favorite. They aren't too thin or thick, they are very soft and smell amazing without being too fragrant. Overall, they provide you with a refreshing, clean face that is gentle on the skin.	&&&
Got these for my son and they are awesome and you can't beat the price.	&&&
I like that these wipes are moist and fresh so there is no transfer of germs from a prior use. They are pleasant to Mother and child both. It is also a great convenience that they can be disposed of so easily. I have some environmental concerns, but sometimes a new Mom needs all the help she can get.	&&&
This is the only wipe case that actually keeps them wet and fresh! Very pleased!	&&&
I prefer huggies wipes over their diapers. They are durable and last a long time.	&&&
Best cleaners ever	&&&
Nothing cleans, disinfects, and leaves a surface smelling nice like Lysol wipes. It's really effective and the best part is I can use it on surfaces that I am unsure of, like public restrooms and the like.	&&&
Perfect wipes for newborn. Very gentle on my newborn son!	&&&
Doesn't keep wipes warm for a long time and the door can't seem to stay closed	&&&
Great product! Great pricing!	&&&
I was introduced to this product by a cast member and was excited to try out. On the first try, I was gentle and light handed because I knew it would feel like sand paper. After and hour, my face could not stop itchy and was burning up! I had a massive breakout on my face and after a week, they have began to scar my face. I have been using a dark spot corrector ever since. I gave it to my roommate who really liked it. Not for me!	&&&
my nieces and nephew didn't have rashes . Huggies the best	&&&
Didnt like it because it is old the tissues are tearing up when you pull them out . Plus they smell . Suppose tone Ordor less . Willnt buy again	&&&
These are the only wipes that have enough moisture to actually remove make up AND mascara. The are generously sized and are gentle to sensitive skin. They also do not burn my eyes like most other wipes. I have allergies and sensitivity and these are the only ones I can use. So glad I can buy them in the USA now, but wish ALL Walgreens carried them in store instead of online. Also very convenient to travel with.	&&&
so happy I bought these wipes for my cpap mask!!! they work perfectly and I highly recommend them and I plan to buy more for my family and friends too!!! :D	&&&
great price	&&&
Product does it's job! It's durable and cleans the way you want your child's bum to be cleaned. Never experienced a problem of the nap falling apart! Great choice.	&&&
Doesn't work, waste of money	&&&
I love the convenience of shopping online for products that are already my favorite	&&&
These things are just fun! I can fit 9, count'em 9 of these into a waterproof match container. Purchased for backpacking, and you can't beat the size and portability for that purpose. These would also have been great way back when the kids were small, stash them in the car, travel bag or your purse. They expand into a fair sized, tough little wipe. Not only does it serve the purpose, I get a smile every time from the re-hydration. How often do you find something that does as advertised and amuses you each time you use it? Hey, they're just neat.	&&&
Best wipes you get for your money . Always bought Huggies wipes they are very strong & durable	&&&
These are the best wipes. We use them at the office. Everyone always tries to keep the containers. It's hard to find them in our office they are like a rare commodity. But they are really great. They have a fresh clean Smell and can wipe up anything.	&&&
"The Clorox Brand is like no other. You don't notice the difference until you purchase a GENERIC BRAND of Bleach and Bleach Cleaners That you see what a MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.
BY ALL MEANS IT'S WORTH THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GERNIC NAME AN THE CLOROX NAME
The smell is also nicer with the Clorox Brand"	&&&
Finally, a wipe that is unscented and really doesn't smell!	&&&
Love these wipes. I use them to clean my stainless steel kitchen appliances...makes everything look shiny and new. Got the gunk off my microwave oven touch panel that nothing else would remove.	&&&
i always buy them in packs of three. The scent is refreshing. and you just feel clean after using it and more importantly you feel the area is disinfected. I mostly use it in kitchen and bathroom and to clean any surface that is not damaged by the wipes, eg my dining table and chair.	&&&
I really like this product. I use it during late night feedings when my daughter's diaper needs changing. The night light allows me to see what I am doing without being too abrasive to wake her up more than necessary. Also the wipes are not as cold and alarming to her bum.	&&&
I wear makeup almost everyday so I've tried many different kinds of wipes: Aveeno, e.l.f, Studio 68, Neutrogena in regular, nightcalming, & deep clean, to name a few. Pretty much all of them were extremely oily and I already have extremely oily skin so I feel gross after using. Some of them also irritated my skin after use giving me tomato red bumps all over and burning my eyes. However with these wipes I've never experienced any problems and they get the job done easily. With one swipe all eye shadow, eye liner, & eye brow pencil are gone; even false lashes come right off. Mascara, foundation, concealer, and matte lipstick take a little more time but no longer than 1 minute. After use, my face is not oily but not dry and feels clean. They're also great to use on hot weather days, after a work out, running for the train; whatever works up a sweat just to clean yourself up. All in all, I promise you will not regret buying this product.	&&&
I always use pampers sensitive wipes but now I'm going to change and only use these. I feel like after I use the pampers one my fingers have a oily/soapy feel. After I use these my fingers are clean without the oily/soapy feeling !	&&&
"Husband loves these for use at the office. He keeps them in his desk drawer, and when needed, fits discreetly in his pocket. Said he really appreciates me buying them, they're making a huge difference while away from home. At home, he uses the medicated wipes from Preparation H."	&&&
My preferred wipe for my daughter and now my son as well even 11 years later! They are not too thick like huggies, and perfect for baby's sensitive skin, pair these wipes with Luvs diapers and you have the best for your baby!	&&&
I received free samples of wipes for the purpose of my review. Strong wipes (no ripping while using) but very soft and gentle on baby's skin. We also use them on the go for sticky faces and hands. I purchased the full size product in the flip top package as well. My only critique is that sometimes the wipes in this style of packaging seem to get stuck together and come out several at a time. Not a deal breaker though, and I will continue to use them.	&&&
These great little wipes fit great in the diaper bag and perfect for on the go messes. Very soft cloth and smells great! Gentle enough to use on my little one's face after eating a messy snack.	&&&
They are not cold. The scent isn't that strong. Leaves you feeling clean and not smelly (lol). Great for a gym bag or for teens to bring to school. Anyone can use these and they are easy to open.	&&&
boought this product for my daughter who was going away to summer camp it works great to disinfect her dorm"}},	&&&
As advertised	&&&
These wipes are so great simply because you can use them basically on EVERYTHING. Amazon also has great pricing on this item when ordering in bulk. I have a terrible sensitivity with a lot of spray cleaners but never had any problems with these. I have been using this product for almost 5 years now, and never have had any issues. This brand is MUCH better then the Windex version. Those wipes are basically worthless. I stand behind Pledge. They have always been a great brand with every product I have tried from them.	&&&
It has been 21 years since I have changed diapers. since my granddaughter and grandson were born pampers sensitive wipes is all we have used. They are durable, smell great, and very soft for my grandkids tushies. I would recommend these wipes to new moms and even new grandmoms.	&&&
I love these! Use them like a wipes if moistened or like I do as a diaper liner. Makes for a quicker clean up and contains solid waste well.	&&&
These work great on hair and skin between baths. We use these almost daily. And the scent is good, but not overpowering.	&&&
I love the thickness and the smell. my only problem is that they are a little harsh on my princess's face. she seems to be very sensitive one her face, but these wipes do a great job on her butt. so in the end I buy both these and sensitive wipes so I can clean up all sorts of mess's. A mommas job is never done.	&&&
I always get this wipes for my grandkids. Excellent for the sensitive baby skin.	&&&
I was happy to have a less toxic wipe for my kids, but they did not like the smell of these "unscented" wipes (I wasn't particular fond of it either)	&&&
I love these values packs! Lysol is great for disinfecting everything in the house!	&&&
"Great quality. Great price.
Would repurchase."	&&&
I keep these under the sink in every bathroom and also in my kitchen. They are so easy to use to clean up small spills or messes. I use them every morning to wipe out the sink in my 2 little daughter's bathroom. That blue childrens toothpaste drives me crazy! One wipe with these every morning and the sink is clean!	&&&
"This product is perfect for wiping those yucky noses. It is so gentle on the skin and the saline really helps to loosen things up up and makes it much easier to wipe those little noses, especially when baby has a cold and runny nose. My daughter loves them. I have to keep them away from her or she will pull them all out and wipe her own nose!"	&&&
Wonderful wipes.	&&&
Warms the wipes. Baby is happier now!	&&&
My Grandson will let me wipe his nose with boogie wipes. They must not burn and r soft.	&&&
These are the best!	&&&
Great for sensitive skin but also have a nice scent to them. I also use them for everything, spills, kids sticky hands, etc. I recommend to all my family and friends. Great for potty trainers too!"	&&&
I love this I have been using Preparation H Regular Medicated Wipes for a year. I was very excited to get a version just for me. It is nice to have a product made for a women. I would recommend this product not just if you have hemorrhoids but for anytime you have a little discomfort in that area. Great product. “I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”	&&&
Great wipes!! But upright dispenser is very annoying cause of threading problem. Have to open and re- thread every time or every other time. Manufacturer! Is there any tip to prevent this? Please!!!	&&&
I switch back and forth between Pampers/Huggies. This box the Huggies ripping in half as you pull them out of the wipes box. They are also longer versus wider than before. I will stick with Pampers moving forward.	&&&
"Nice wipes container. Perfect to stick in your diaper bag. Also nice to have one in the car or random rooms in the home. I actually bought this to have another one around because they are so handy. The container doesn't take up much room so can easily be slipped in a drawer so it's out of site. The wipes are nice too! Not many in the container but if you are going to refill it, it fits more than just 16 wipes. The natural care wipes are probably my favorite Huggie wipes. They are soft and don't have any funny smell. They also are not too thin and clean well!"	&&&
I used this wipe type for a long while til I started getting sensitive to smells & went to Fresh Scent. It was a great product & did it's job! It's soft & has that "powder" smell to keep baby smelling fresh. Atleast to me. Tho after awhile It started to get overwhelming since we use wipes for EVERYTHING! Overall, this is a GREAT product for someone who's NOT sensitive at all to smells since the smell is VERY strong atleast to me!	&&&
love these wipes. they are fantastic and its so nice to do subscribe and save and not have to buy them in the store. I use them for 3 kids! They are scent free and so nice for baby's bottoms.	&&&
the containers are sharp around the edges where you reach in to pull out the wipes and the wipes don't keep coming out of the container the right way. Probably switching to other brand.	&&&
"I just started using the Seventh Generation Line of Cleaning Products. The other items that I have used...the toilet bowl cleaner and the dishwasher powder...have worked really well. The toilet bowl cleaner really smells good too!

These wipes work good, but the smell is awful! I tried to get used to the scent, but I just couldn't stand it.

I bought the Method Cleaning Wipes a couple of year's ago, via drugstore.com, and loved them! They worked extremely well, smelled wonderful, and you could flush them down the toilet. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find them for quite awhile.

I hope that Seventh Generation can make the wipes with a scent that is much more appealing. Otherwise, I won't buy this product again."	&&&
Love these! My daughter makes a mess whenever she eats (hey she's a baby, it happens!) and I was trying to use regular baby wipes on her hands/face. Even though I get "sensitive skin w/aloe" wipes, she was still getting a rash on her face. Then I tried these and poof, no more rash!	&&&
Super product provided by the best seller i've ever dealt with	&&&
Absolutely the best wipes out there. I've tried others and they can't compare to Huggies!!	&&&
They're my wipes of choice for several reasons. They're less irritating on my hands and have less scent than most other wipes. Also the small packets are very convenient to carry around; they fit nicely in pockets, even small ones. As to how well they sanitize, who knows about any of these wipes?	&&&
Love these wipes - and you cannot beat the price! Thanks Amazon :)	&&&
Pampers wipes have never been a favorite but I tried them again recently and the feel soapy and leave my sons skin very dry I used one to wipe my own face and it burned and scratched my skin..	&&&
Love these wipes!! they're stronger than Huggies, cheaper than Pampers and they smell great.	&&&
Love these wipes really is one and done Doesn't irratete my sons or daughters skin	&&&
"At a young age I was taught to finish up with soap and water, a practice I stopped out of social necessity. Torn between my European upbringing and what was available in American bathrooms, my inexplicable need for cleanliness just couldn't be had with a dry piece of paper; a need so great, that I was potty trained at age 1 because I gagged myself to death with a #2 in my diaper. I compromised for decades only going at home or knowing where the single toilet bathrooms were, then I could wet toilet paper from the faucet. Let me say this, toilet paper *is not* designed for this task! But one day. One. Fine. Day, 10 years ago, I discovered flush-able wipes. Although it was another brand, I was practically in heaven. I have used Charmin Freshmates for years now, it is simply the best alternative to washing with water. I have packages everywhere: at work, in my car, hand carried in a backpack, when I travel or am deployed, I don't leave without them.

They are my favorite wipe for the following reasons:
+ smooth surface, hemorrhoid friendly!
+ sheet dimensions are 5""x7""
+ soothes the burning from watery stools
+ the only wipe that does not feel like wet sandpaper or Brillo pad
+ can be used in an emergency to wipe up toilet seats!
+ fingers won't break through
+ easy to tear

However, they are not without faults:
+ every 3rd or 4th wipe, and without fail, out comes 2-3 wipes.
+ the Charmin plastic container does not seal well and leads to dry wipes.
+ refill packs reseals, but you have to neatly tuck the protruding wipe back in. Otherwise it bunches and the seal doesn't work.

Regarding the pro reason: ""easy to tear"".
I use Freshmates as a final cleaning stage, but found that one just wasn't enough. Given the dimensions of each sheet, my overall wiping area, and I have been doing this for 38 years, I figured that I could clean with smaller sections. Tearing these like a sheet of paper was too inconsistent with a big piece in one hand and too small a piece in the other. However, an index finger works well as a guide, much placing a ruler over a piece of paper and pulling against the edge. Lay the wipe across the index finger and hold with thumb at the midway point. This utilizes the length of the finger as an ""edge"" so when the wipe is pulled with the other hand it results in two proportionately sized pieces -with practice."	&&&
"I had previously purchased s box of pampers sensitive wipes from Target ($15.99 for 576 wipes) when prpearing for our baby to arrive. After we used up the Pampers supply, I turned to a stock of Huggies wipes that we received as a gift. Comparing these top two brands of baby wipes, my personal opinion is that Pampers brand far exceed Huggies for the following reasons:

1. Pampers are much thicker and more durable. When removing them from the packaging (I've used the refill packs, individual pop top packs and plastic tub packs) they come out easily. Huggies wipes seemed to rip more often than not when removing them from their packaging.

2. Pampers wipes have more moisture content. They make wiping easy and smooth and I dont feel like I'm rubbing hard to removed any residue off of baby. Huggies wipes felt dried out in comparison to the Pampers. I felt like I was rubbing baby's bottom raw and noticed her bottom started to turn red after just one day of using them.

Specifically reviewing this Amazon purchase of Pampers wipes, I give this purchase 5 stars. Price wise, the value is great compared to in store purchases. Sometimes additional coupons are even offered on Amazon, making the purchase an even better deal!"	&&&
They work great!!!	&&&
Clorox wipes are very easy to use for quick cleanups.	&&&
I received some of these wipes at my baby shower and tried them out recently. I really like them, they get the job done and I don't need to use a crazy amount to get it done. They are thick so I don't have to worry about them ripping and me getting poo on my hands which I really like. Thanks for making a great product.	&&&
I love clorox wipes. It's nice to know that when i'm in a pinch for time i could use the wipes and know that it's not only clean but disinfected!	&&&
I usually get the spray, that's what Ill buy next time	&&&
"I use the product not only for pacifiers but for toys and bottles that have fallen on the floor especially when we are out.
They are good smelling and disinfect.
Nothing that isn't great.
No product suggestions."	&&&
I ordered these so that we could have wipes containers in both cars. They seem well made and like they will keep the wipes moist. My only suggestion is that you put wipes in and seal them and then push excess air out (the containers are not air tight).	&&&
The gentleness of these wipes are fantastic. They're soft on my babies' skin.	&&&
Great wipes. Thick, stay together well, don't have a horrible smell. I would buy again	&&&
I'm a runner and they are great to have handy and ready to use after a run to clean my face and cleanse my pores. I don't have oily skin I have normal) but I do use these almost every night to remove my make up. I produce little white bumps around my eyes and upper eye lids and the only thing that will break these down are these face clothes! Poof after a bit they are gone.These face clothes will leave you with a nice tingling clean sensation. I LOVE THEM!	&&&
These are amazing! And I LOVE the tubs!!	&&&
This was perfect for the event I had. The wipes were shipped on time and were not dried out (as I read in a pervious review). I was very pleased.	&&&
These aren't too wet/damp and they're very soft. So far, they've been great. Just wish the perforations were a bit easier to tear.	&&&
It is a very handy case.	&&&
Simply Clean, those are the key words. When I got grand kids, I started using wipes for all sorts of different things besides the obvious. I also tried several different ones. My daughter first introduced me to these Huggies, and I had once worked for Kimberly Clark making the first Huggies diapers that came out years ago. These wipes clean well, and they don't leave anything behind. Pardon the pun.	&&&
baby wipes work great	&&&
Love that I don't react to these wipes and that they don't dry out my skin"}	&&&
I've gone through 2+ boxes of waterwipes so far and I love them. My baby never gets a rash. He's gotten a few red spots from farting out little bits of poop too much, but a day of lotion and it's gone. I really feel these wipes have helped keep my baby's bum clean and irritation-free. I've been promoting them to other friends as well. My only complaint is that it can be difficult to get out of the package. Sometimes I pull and 3 wipes come out at once instead of 1. It can be frustrating during late at night diaper changes. Other than that, these wipes are great.	&&&
Great wipes to wet a little	&&&
After having too many issues trying to keep the hard-shell wipes case closed, I turned to the Buti-pod. Just started using this last week, and it's kept my wipes moist in a container that doesn't take up too much space - and it stays closed! The only concern I would have is that I've had to struggle with the zipper a couple times already, and I can foresee this being an ongoing issue. This isn't the best thing when you have a very active infant mid-diaper-change rolling around! However, it seems to be one of the better options I've found so far.	&&&
This multi-pack is excellent. The clorox wipes disinfect just about everything from counters to cabinets to microwave. Perfect for cleaning up. The multipack makes it so I have them on hand.	&&&
These are the best wipes. Thick and clean well.	&&&
great shower gift	&&&
I thought it was really going to like these wipes because I always see them at the store when I go to target but overall just a little too thin I feel like I have to use two of them just to make sure nothing gets through them but overall they're okay	&&&
These wipes are hard to pull out of the box and are basically paper wipes soaked with witch hazel. Cooling is more what they offer than healing.	&&&
Totally worth the money. I usually get everything off with 1 wipe. With other brands. I would need 3-4. Totally recommend them. Kat Von D's products rock!	&&&
Works well for honest brand wipes.	&&&
I recieved a free sample of the wipes to try. I was impressed at how lg and durable the wipes are as they are made thick. I also love that they are dye, alcohol, paraban, and fragrance free so they do not burn baby's butt or break them out. I definitely recommend these wipes.	&&&
They are thick and strong and non irritatting but I'm not sure if they are worth the price. The diapers are horrible but the wipes are ok. They don't tear like the seventh generation wipes do but I also use baby ganics wipes and baby ganics diapers exclusively and they are the best to me for the price even though the wipes are thin you get more per pack and more for the money. I usually just buy whatever of these three brands of wipes are on sale and rotate out the packs as I use them.	&&&
Lysol wipes are by far one of my favorite cleaning items! I use the subscribe and save feature through Amazon as they are cheaper this way & because of my frequent use of them, I know I will always gave them on hand. These wipes are strong enough for some pretty tough jobs if needed. They do not tear easily. I mainly use them for quick clean ups like wiping down counters, bathroom, sink, etc. I depend on Lysol products a great deal since I have Rheumatoid Arthritis & a couple other auto-immune disorders. I get sick very easily from others germs. If someone has been visiting I simply grab the wipes, wipe the door handles & toss, cannot get much easier than this. They are fast and simple to use. I use the spray for my bigger jobs, like after cooking, but if it's just a quick wipe up or in between cleaning these are perfect. I would like to say I am very environment conscience and try not to use a lot of toss away products, but being sick and limited most days, these are a Godsend. Thank you for reading.	&&&
Use with flannel wipes & lavender oil solution for after those romantic times. Very nice for all. Travels well too.	&&&
These wipes are wonderful and this box comes with one dispenser for wipes. It is very good at cleaning hands and mouth and very handy on travel. I keep one box in each room for immediate access when needed also one box in car. Works great for cleaning after snacking or just needed to little fresh n up. No strong smell .	&&&
Really great easy way to sanitize hands...(and to quickly wipe off a changing surface). The individual packaging makes them easy for travel.	&&&
I like these. I will buy them again when I run out.	&&&
Fantastic to use while on vacation in Europe! Great value!	&&&
We've been using these for years. It's nice to know there are sanitizing wipes that do not contain alcohol.	&&&
I received this product & it has helped a lot. If you haven't tried it yet, you should. The great thing about the wipes is that they are flushable so you don't have to worry about your toilet clogging up. I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
My favorite wipes! No scent, not too "wet" like the Pamper's sensitive wipes. I feel good that these are natural and they are strong and work well without ripping or tearing. We have not had any issues and my son has sensitive skin. Amazon always has great prices on these wipes.	&&&
Not as soft as pampers wipes, but much better than parent choice wipes.	&&&
I bought the wipes for my newborn baby....I use the wipes and water to clean her face and butt...the wipes are soft and the size is perfect for infant	&&&
These wipes burn like acid. Cause a skin reaction and they feel slimy when you use them, Contacted Pampers and was able to get a refund since I had opened all boxes for better storage, I was not able to return to Amazon. I purchase d several boxes because we had received Amazon gift certificates and we go trough wipes like crazy. If you have not used these before try first. We are not the only ones having this issued. We found out on baby blogs that others are having same problem.	&&&
i always like to keep on hand for little hands (and feet)!	&&&
Great to carry everywhere in case you have the urge...	&&&
These are the best hand sanitizers I have ever found. The cloth is nice and large and there is no annoying scent or sticky residue left behind on your hands after you use them. I used to be able to buy them in the grocery store, but they have disappeared there, so I was really happy to find them on Amazon. A bit pricey, but worth it.	&&&
I'm not a huge fan of makeup remover wipes because they are usually greasy. These are great and refreshing. Cute travel pak keeps wipes moist and don't take up much room in my makeup bag. Worth buying.	&&&
The best product for male dogs!	&&&
These wipes are the only wipes that don't give my son a rash. Only issue I have with them is that sometimes the material of the wipes shed and leave behind a fuzz.	&&&
I purchased these cloth wipes to add to the Lionheart Wipe Warmer. They are smooth and absorbent. These wipes along with warmer have decreased the drama on the changing the table. There used to be blood curdling screams at changing time, now he actually laughs and dances. Not to mention, it saves money and far more eco-friendly. What a change in the right direction?!	&&&
Been using these for many years - they stay moist seemingly forever and dont scratch my lenses (eyeglasses or camera).	&&&
These wipes are mild and soft. I only took off 1 star because they kind of stick to my baby's bottom and they don't always break at the perforated line.	&&&
Bought these for my husband to clean his glasses, which are pretty clean thanks to these little wipes. After he cleans his glasses, my husband uses the wipe to clean our phone screens, so we get more bang per wipe.	&&&
I wear glasses every day, and sometimes a dry cloth just isn't enough to get the smudges off. I use these almost every day to clean my lenses. I also use them to clean the screen on my smart phone. They are excellent.	&&&
"I expected a cloth perhaps damp with some type lotion or cleanser for the price. All it is a
rough piece of cloth -dry- with instructions on wetting. Will not repurchase."	&&&
I have been using facial wipes for many years and recently started using this store brand and I am in love. They effectively take off my mascara and with one wipe all of my make up is removed. All I need to do is gently rinse with water after and I am done for the night. I will definitely repurchase and tell my friends to buy.	&&&
No problems with product. Subscription delivery is always online. No complaints.	&&&
"The wipes are a little dry, but smell good and are very convenient when you need to clean a pacifier or your little one's hands."	&&&
I have at least one container in each room in my house. These wipes are life savers when it comes to cleaning up messes.	&&&
love this, every package comes with a new wipe container also	&&&
These wipes are very sturdy and don't come apart when cleaning messes. The quality is great and you can do more with just a couple than with cheaper ones.	&&&
These work great and I love the scent it's so refreshing but light. They have some roughness so you just have to use carefully around the eyes.	&&&
I got this as a shower gift and I love them!! The resealable I put in the diaper bag and the refill packs we reserve for home in the nursery. It's an amazing balance that's practical for our family. They don't have a fragrance and are easy on her sensitive skin. :) definitely recommend	&&&
It is okay, have used better items in the past at the same price point. Won't buy again.	&&&
Have used Lysol for years,I love Lysol,and when the wipes came out I tried them and now keep them every where even in my car and my purse.don't go any where with out them	&&&
I love this wipes! They are a fresh smell, without giving my baby a rash. I notice that other wipes make my daughter get diaper rash	&&&
These wipes are great. But $20 for a pack (60ct) of 2 is ridiculous. Walgreens has them for about $4 a pack. Way overpriced here.	&&&
I love this wipes they smell good and the quality id so good. They don't tear into pieces. I have used them with my little brothers,niece and nephews and now I am ready to use them with my newborn on the way.	&&&
Nice wipe. I use these for a first step of facial cleansing and with a little Mario B. makeup remover lotion to remove my eye makeup. Neither irritates my eyes. These are pricier than they should be, but gentle and effective.	&&&
Great wipes. They are thin but do not fall apart. Very strong for being on the thin side. I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish they were a bit larger.	&&&
I have a 3 month old baby at home and only like to use these wipes! They do a great job cleaning and are very gentle on babies skin. The scent of these is very light, if any at all, which I appreciate. This is the Pampers wipe I recommend!	&&&
Wipes just as described and most importantly they have a nice fresh clean scent. Will buy again	&&&
These wipes are great. Very soft on the baby and clean great	&&&
THESE ARE MY FAVORITE PAMPERS WIPES. THEY SMELL GOOD, CLEAN GOOD AND YOU GET THE MOST FOR YOUR MONEY :)	&&&
"This was a great deal, the smaller packages were on special but I chose the huge tub of it. It's perfect for a quick wipe of the cafeteria counter or table. I like to wipe down my telephone receiver especially with all the germs right now. I love the lemon fresh scent which is part of the reason I chose this particular product. In fact it cost less than the fancy smelling ones that I didn't want. It works just as well if not better than the wipes with the little rubber dot scrubbers on them."	&&&
I need to sometimes add water to the wipes and I don't feel like they clean very well.	&&&
Best wipe for your you-know-what	&&&
I used clorox wipes everyday. Without it I feel my house is not clean. I clean everything with the wipes. And makes my house feel clean and shine love it.	&&&
i love clorox wipes because they are so easy to use. it is really easy to clean by just grabbing a wipe and using it to quickly wipe down a surface. i probably go through a can of these a week!	&&&
Baby wipes! I like how they come in bags to separate so you can restock the plastic boxes.	&&&
It is a great price for baby wipes! They have a nice scent to them also.	&&&
The only brand I will buy. As a school teacher, I need wipes that are reliably wet and ready to use. The container is easy to use and dispense the wipes well.	&&&
I use this type of product for my glasses, the screen on my computer devices etc. I am not crazy over this companies wipe. Feels very papery and just cleans OK. Once I finish with these I will go back to Flents Wipe N Clear. To me it feels more cloth like and I feel it cleans better and leaves less streaks. So the idea of trying a new product was OK but the result was not. Anyway, my opinion.	&&&
These were nothing special. They remove make up alright, but the cloth is very thin.	&&&
These wipes, OMG! R Great! They actually work, on my good ole' used (really used) silverwares that were last clean in 1999 (I was still using them, tarnish and all). The minute the package arrived, opened it, and went to work. I used ONLY 1 wipe for about 28 pieces, only added a few drops of warm water to the wipe and I'm certain it will work for another 12 pieces.	&&&
These wipes are fabulous and clean great. I love to know that I am using Clorox to clean but without the bleach smell.	&&&
Very convenient. They smell a lot like cleaning alcohol and dries very quickly, but, they do the trick and gets fingerprints and oily stuff out of my eyeglasses without scratching them. I used one for cleaning my laptop screen... didnt go so well. it cleaned but it got dry too quickly, maybe because I had my computer turned on... But again, i got them mainly for my eyeglasses.	&&&
Definitely read something before you get it because it does contain Salicylic Acid so it may burn but it didn't in my case. It definitely does take off makeup fine unless you aren't using normal makeup :/ I would recommend them because it does exactly what it says it will do, I feel like it cleared up my face too.	&&&
I loev the way pampers baby fresh wipes feel and small	&&&
We go through them like crazy but they're easily my favorite of any wipes I've ever used.	&&&
Love love love these wipes! The double side is perfect especially if you have tougher spots to clean than other areas. It's very effective for general cleaning. I use these on my electronics, too.	&&&
With small children in the home it gets kind of busy. especially cleaning.. these wipes make it so easy and fast..	&&&
This product works great.	&&&
Good for travel and a quick clean, but beware, the alcohol is strong and might sting sensitive skin.	&&&
Great for stinky, dirty dogs!!	&&&
Love these! These are the only wipes we use for baby. Great rating from the environmental working group as well!	&&&
I use this to clean my skin as well as making me feel refreshed. Wonderful scent of pink grapefruit.	&&&
We were already fans of Swaddlers Sensitive diapers, so it just made sense to trust the brand that has given so much comfort to our little one. Sensitive Wipes have delivered on their promise. I can count on one hand the number of instances of diaper rash our little bundle has experienced, and I'm sure I have Pampers Sensitive Wipes to thank. The softest material makes for the softest of diaper changes. You simply can't go wrong with a proven brand like Pampers! Don't be foo led by bargain brands that claim to be "sensitive": Pampers Sensitive Wipes are the "real deal"!!	&&&
I use these for my 6 YO, the regular wipes are too strong for kids!	&&&
These area an absolute MUST HAVE in my classroom each year. I have my students wipe down their desks every day (or almost every day). I am so grateful that I do that. Their desks are disgusting after one day's use. They have so many pencil and marker marks on the desks that would just accumulate each day if I didn't use the Lysol wipes. My students know that the lemon scent is my favorite. When they bring them in that's what they bring me. It helps my classroom smelling fresh.	&&&
Love it thanks for a great product	&&&
So convenient. These wipes are easy to use and smell good without smelling like chemicals or having an overpowering lemon smell like some brands. They arent expensive and go on sale often. I use them in the kitchen, bwthrooms, even the car.	&&&
I absolutely love baby wipes. They smell so good and they are easy access to anything you need to clean up. I really love these.	&&&
One of the best wipes I've come across, use them all the time on all lenses.	&&&
not too soft, prefer to use pampers	&&&
These wipes are awesome. They are nice and large, so you really only need one per diaper change (and your hand is safely covered). Two wipes if it is a really bad diaper. They are great for getting stuff off baby's bum without having to scrub. We also got a big box off Huggies wipes and while we love Huggies diapers, the wipes leave a lot to be desired... Pampers Sensitives are the bomb.	&&&
These wipes serve their purpose, but they are not our favorite. I prefer a double ply flannel wipe. These are nice and thin, but I feel like some of the waste can get through easier, so I go through more wipes with a poo diaper.	&&&
Wow what a great value! My son has sensitive skin and got a pretty bad yeast infection/diaper rash. Our pediatrician recommended that we rinse the wipes we had in water (I.e. Pampers) to eliminate the residue and fragrances that might be too abrasive for his skin. But when I found these water only wipes it was perfect. Much gentler on my baby's skin. The value pack is an enormous size and well worth the price.	&&&
I work in a childcare setting. We use only Clorox wipes to disinfect the building. They work great for quick clean ups and getting rid of germs	&&&
Love this product! They're so soft, but durable and they smell nice but not over powering! Highly recommend them!	&&&
Light scent, right size, flushable and very mild. Keep me clean and fresh!	&&&
These are so awesome. It's like using a washcloth. So soft and strong.	&&&
"These are the best towelettes ever, and the price is extremely reasonable, too!
I use them for everything."	&&&
These wipes are fabulous and a great value. Thick and gentle, well moisturized and has caused no skin sensitivity.	&&&
Another fantastic pampers product. Preferred brand for wipes! Theses ones are great.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! They are essential for everyday cleaning and disinfecting. They are very handy for cleaning up messes and leaving counter tops spotless. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for good cleaning products!	&&&
Wonderful wipes! The texture is probably the best of all wipes. They clean great and make you feel confident that you cleaned well. However, the reason for the four stars is because the scent is way too strong for my liking and has a scent of chemical wipes. It is my fault for ordering them for I could have ordered the unscented ones. But overall I like them better than Pampers wipes.	&&&
This stuff works. It worked way better than I expected. My headlights were in worse shape than the "before" ones shown on the Amazon page for this product. The results were better than the "after" images. I was hoping to just make them better and then maybe use one of the harder to apply options. Happily that will not be the case. The wipes instantly removed most of the yellow film. A few more wipes over the lenses made it even better and a few more over the edges pressing a little harder and I was done. I waited for the lenses to dry as the instructions note and used the finishing wipes. They put a shine on the lenses that made them look as good as new. I am happy with this product and I recommend it. Maybe not waiting as long as I did to clean the lenses. The illumination at night is greatly improved.	&&&
I use these every Monday morning to clean up my workspace. This includes desk, keyboard, phone, and the mouse. The smell is a little strong for me but it clears up after a few minutes. With the way the wipes come out and my incredible strength, I always seem to pull out two wipes instead of one which isn't the worst thing in the world. I always have trouble with pulling out a bit of the third wipe as well which I end up having to tuck back into the container for me to worry about the following Monday.	&&&
all natural high quality 30 wipes for only 15$???? This is crazy. And it removes waterproof makeup so easily, gently and fast.	&&&
Great way to clean up baby's nose...product feels clean and fresh (e.g., no chemical odor).	&&&
"My dog does NOT like the taste of these unfortunately :( I was hoping she would be like the other reviewr's dogs, licking my hands and whatnot! But I guess she's not crazy about the minty ness. However, I have seen gunk come right off her teeth and onto these pads plus noticed a difference in her back molars when using this consistently!

I used to only use the Dental chews but I want to really make sure we keep her teeth super healthy and clean and I'm happy to have these on hand along with a little finger brush!"	&&&
I have these stockpiled, maybe a 60 packages left. They never dry out, even after sitting for a year (unopened of course) Love these wipes	&&&
Won't be buying these again! I will stick to Huggies because they give you more for the money!	&&&
i love these wipes! i use them in every room in the house! they also smell good as well	&&&
As the mother of a newborn who spits up a lot, I was so excited to find this product. However, my excitement turned to disappointment when I actually opened the package. Holy cow these have such a strong scent -- like some sort of cheap perfume. I tried using them once but the smell irritated me and the actual wipes irritated my little one's skin.	&&&
LOVE these wipes! They are large and thick. It is great to not have to worry about getting a "tub" the lid is plastic so you don't have to worry about it not closing properly and the wipes drying out.	&&&
These wipes are thin and break apart easily when trying to wipe my pets down. Also because they're thin it takes many wipes to get the job done.	&&&
Always a great buy!	&&&
5 stars for now, shipping was very fast, and it came nicely packaged. The reason I cant write a full review at this time is because I havent actually used the product yet. Its a baby shower gift for my bestfriend. I spent a lot of time on amazon looking for the perfect 100% organic products for newborns and these had the best reviews, as far as wipes go. I also love that they are dry so there's no chance for bacterial or microbial growth. Also no dyes, bleach, or chemicals which is a huge plus for both mama and baby!	&&&
"I have to say, I'm really not a big fan of these wipes! We've used the Kirkland brand for the past two years. I bought these on a whim because the price was right.

Some of the reasons I don't care for them;

1. They have a slimy, oily feel to them. I use wipes to wipe off my toddlers hands pretty often and they leave this oily residue. I feel like I need to wash my hand afterwards. I asked my husband also just to make sure it wasn't in my head and he feels the same.

2. It's nearly impossible to just pull one wipe out. If you don't pull carefully and use two hands you'll end up pulling out 5+ wipes. This makes it very very difficult to grab a wipe one handed which you often have to do while changing a diaper.

3. They dry out very very easily. After you accidentally pull out 5 wipes instead of one and try shoving them back in, you'll come back to dried out wipes every time.

Overall I was just not impressed with the wipes. I definitely won't be purchasing them again!"	&&&
Fast shipping. Great product.	&&&
I have very sensitive eyes and have tried many many removers and reacted to them. I have been using these wipes for around 3 weeks now and love them. The mascara comes away easily and leaves my eyes soothed. Highly recommend to all, esp sensitive skin/eyes like mine!	&&&
For those of you considering other wipes because of reviews stating the wipes stick together, I just want to say, you only need to pull out about 3-4 prior to starting changing the poopy diaper and leave them on top of the wipes package for easy access during changing. Didn't take me very long to figure that one out, but for other people it seems they weren't quite smart enough to come up with this idea ;) so other than that issue, these wipes are THE BEST! So big and soft and practically impossible to rip, I've tried, they stretch so big if you pull on them. And they are super juicy/wet/moist, which is amazing when you have a dirty poop covered but ;) we've been using these wiles for over two years and it wouldn't buy anything else!	&&&
These work just as well as Sephora Wipes, except they are much cheaper.	&&&
Easier than cleaning the mask every morning, works very well.	&&&
Love these wipes and love the price on here	&&&
very good price	&&&
Great wipes. I have bad night sweats and need to wipe off my mask multiple times a night. The wipes are unscented and even with my sensitive skin they do not cause irritation. I love them.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes! I use them for everything. They just always seem to clean, deodorize and disinfect every surface I use them on (better than any other brand that I have tried).	&&&
knowing that this doesn't have any harsh chemicals, I'm hooked on using this for my 2 y/o daughter. I use it even on her mouth without hesitation. great product!	&&&
Clorox wipes are amazing. We have them in every room in the house and use them on a variety of surfaces. Love the fresh smell!	&&&
Best Wipes in the market!!	&&&
These are the best wipes out there. They clean up nice and are just the right thickness.	&&&
Great when you're on the move.	&&&
I think I use these too much, because I'm always reordering. Usually prefer Lysol brand products, but not for these wipes - Clorox is better!!	&&&
We use Boogie Wipes to clean our little one's nose b/c they are softer and more gentle than tissue.	&&&
I find the huggies wipes have been the best for me. They dont seem to break apart. and it gets the job done.	&&&
These are nice. But they smell like baby wipes! And are outragiously priced!!!! I can get a box of the equate(wal mart) brand, that are the exact same thing, for $1.67!!! I'll never buy these again, all propaganda!!	&&&
These Purell Sanitizing Hand Wipes are perfect for travel. They fit well in purse, briefcase and backpacks. They are safe for carry on items because they are not in liquid form. They are great to sanitize airplane trays, seatbelts, remote controls in hotel rooms, steering wheels and gearshifts in rental cars and many other things along the way. . They are awesome!!	&&&
These arrived very dry and the flavor was soapy, I will stick with spiffies!	&&&
Hands down the best wipes! They are thick, soft and just the right texture for cleaning dirty baby bottoms :)	&&&
These wipes definitely work wonders to our kitchen counters, haha. As college students in our own apartment, we tend to make quite the mess in our kitchen and these wipes make up for an easy cleaning session. I don't have to scrub/rub really hard on the surface. It takes out the mess easily.	&&&
These are the best wipes on the market! We tried several different brands before we found our forever wipe! They are soft and gentle but strong enough to get the job done. Try them, you won't be disappointed!!	&&&
These are my all time favorite wipes! Many of the other brands I've used are too wet and make it hard to clean up the mess, but these are pretty perfect. I go for them every time.	&&&
This 3pack of Clorox disinfecting wipes were a great buy at Staples....I paid only $4.99....Wow that is what you call a sale. One alone will run you $2.50. Not only did I saved money but I also saw where Staples price match there products...for so long I have been shopping at other places for my cleaning supplies but now I know that Staples price match I will forever be a Staples customers and shop there for my cleaning supplies as well as my office and computer needs..so glad I am a Staples customer."}},	&&&
I use these when I go to the gym. I put some in a Ziploc bag to clean the exercise equipment before I use it. It is easy to use and great to really clean the germs or bacteria off the machines."}},	&&&
Use these for cleaning almost everything. Love them for all sorts of cleanup in the kitchen, especially.	&&&
I got this as a member of Smiley 360 and was so glad. I have problems with hemmorhoids and have my whole life. These Preparation H wipes for women are perfect. They provide the perfect relief and are great for even the most inconvienent times. These will definently be in home at all times and there will even be a few in my purse!! Thank you for finally giving relief when we need it the most!!	&&&
Perfectly packaged for travel and convenience	&&&
You must have these if you pump on the go! It's super easy to have them to help you clean up. I even used them to clean a table and a restaurant when my baby was old enough to sit in a high chair. "	&&&
The one thing I hate about cleaning products.... is when the wipes dry out and I end up throwing some of them away.....this has never happened with the Clorox brand Disinfecting Wipes. Always a ton of cleanser and the wipes are quite sturdy. This is a great cleaning product!! I will continue to buy this product again and again! And even better, when buying the three pack, you save, save, save! :) Very economical! I would recommend it to anyone, especially clean freaks like me! lol Way to go Clorox!"}},	&&&
"PLEASE put them in the stores again!!!!!!! We like individual packs!
Thanks"	&&&
Does not leave a filmy feel... smells great! I use it after hot yoga when I don't want to shower at the studio. I keep it in the car too and it makes my car smell very nice. Will definitely buy more!	&&&
"These are amazing!! I never thought these would be one of my must haves, but they are essential in my diaper bag!

Not only do I use them for the occasional pacifier drops, but I use them to clean high chairs! I first go over the high chair with a baby wipe then the pacifier wipe! I then have no worries about any chemicals that may linger on the table when I feed my girls their finger foods! :) :)

I also use them to wipe down toys when we're out.

I love these wipes and they have proven to be extremely versatile!! Highly recommend!"	&&&
This is a really good item, reasonably priced, purchased from a great vendor.	&&&
if these were always on their sale price, I wouldn't buy anything else. they are the best size and clean nicely with peace of mind for your baby's skin and the environment.	&&&
We honestly love using these wipes on our child! They are sturdy, and don't tear easily. We've been using them for over a year, now with no complaints!	&&&
We used these when our babies were newborns and even longer for one of our munchkins with super sensitive skin. We loved how soft they were and that the smell was gentle. Great wipes!	&&&
these are the best.....after years of searching for a reasonable and good product this is the answer. I have used wipes from a leading eye glass provider (L) for many years but they are expensive. also they are only available at the brick and mortar store which is very unreasonable for easy shopping. So these Zeiss wipes are the best solution I have found. I have shared them with other family members who also agree they are great for eyeglasses.	&&&
I wouldn't use these on a daily basis because of the price tag, but they were fabulous on our camping trip!	&&&
I think all parents should own a wipe warmer. We have used this with regular wipes and also cloth wipes. It's awesome. The only thing that you would need a heads up about, is that you need to put a towel underneath therefore the moisture doesn't leak when opening the container. I purchased this item even after reading the reviews that stated the same thing as I said. It;s a great product and even with having to put a hand towel down, it's not an issue for us. It doesn't leak just drips when opening.	&&&
"These wipes just help alleviate the burning and itching for a while, but it does not treat the hemorrhoids. It is a great product to clean the area before applying any ointment. It is great that they come in individual packages. They are great to carry in a purse and be discrete about it.
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
We have been using these for our baby's diaper changes. With diaper rash, sometimes the pre-moistened wipes are irritating to the skin, but with these, we can just use plain water, and it is much better. These are also soft on the skin. They are soft, but do not tear easily. They are a bit large, so I often cut them in half (I open the pack and cut them while watching TV or something). Also, I keep a little squirt bottle handy by the changing table, and it works well for wetting the wipes.	&&&
My little boy has extremely sensitive skin and is very prone to diaper rash. It was extremely difficult to get his diaper rash better, I tried everything .and would give him a bath every day. Since I have found these wipes his diaper rash has improved immensely. These wipes were a godsend. Since I started using them he hasn't had any rash or problems and doesn't scream anymore when I change his diaper. I strongly recommend this product to anyone who has a baby with sensitive skin. You will not be disappointed!!!	&&&
Great product. They are big enough to give about 4-5 wipes. If you haven't tried these you definitely should. Depending on the type of poop you have you don't always feel clean after wiping with just toilet paper. These are great for those situations where you feel you need a shower after that horrible explosion that left the bowl looking like a Mr. Hankey warzone.	&&&
I love how easy the clorox wipes are to use. Its convenient, and cleans up the mess no matter how big it is. I especially like the fresh clean smell afterwards.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. They smell good and I believe that they kill all bacteria. I like any Clorox brand.	&&&
Only disinfecting wipes that I will use for my household, they're very good and keep everything sanitized	&&&
Great fr glasses camera lenses and tablet and phone screens	&&&
You get what you pay for! You won't regret buying these instead of the store brand! You will actually save money because it takes 2 or 3 of the cheap wipes to do what 1 Clorox wipe will do.	&&&
These are my absolute favorite! I can't find anyother wipe that smells amazing as these do. They smell the best and are made perfect! They are unexpensive for sure and you pay a great price for like 80 wipes!!	&&&
Love these wipes! Best wipes I've ever used! Super soft and strong and Eco-friendly as well as not containing harmful ingredients!	&&&
Good customer service. I had an issue with mine when it arrived in the mail and the folks took care of it. The product works fine, but the finishing wipes are very oily and attract a lot of dust and crap that the wind blows. It looks messy. The instructions suggest not to wipe the headlights after applying it, but i think i am gonna have to in order to get rid of the dirt and pollen sticking to my headlights.	&&&
Keeps wipes moist and almost always easy to remove individually. Handy window lets you see when you're running low. We have a few of these: one for the changing table, one on each toilet for our own use.	&&&
Before you leave the hospital, the nurse or whoever discharges you, will give you a list of things you need to do. One of them is using just a soft cloth and water when cleaning your newborn. They don't smell like anything pretty by far, but they also only contain water and a bit of fruit juice that acts as a preservative, all in a convenient package... How can you get more natural yet modern? You can't. I used these for newborn "baths" as well as diaper changes and this whole box lasted up until my son was about 2 months old (I don't wipe after every single pee, since urine is sterile). By then I felt more comfortable using scented products on my son's skin (we received many boxes of baby wipes and I plan to take advantage of our loved ones' generosity). BUT when your baby is brand-spankin' new, you want to use stay true and use as little chemicals as possible.	&&&
Pretty thick paper and seems to work well. I used it on my dog also. It is nice that this does not have tons of chemicals. Have you tried to clean up tar with regular baby wipes? No other cleaning products cleaned the tar that fell onto our bathroom floor after getting our roof done, but baby wipes cleaned up right away. That concerns me. I would not use something strong like that on my dog. So I am glad my friend told me about this one!	&&&
Very disappointing with this product. I was using it since my daughter was born but now they changed it and the wipes are paper thin and rip and tear while you are trying to clean the mess. The old ones were great, nice and thick and now I have to use so many more to clean everything it's not worth it anymore.	&&&
I can't imagine using chemical-filled baby wipes when these are on the market. They're so handy and gentle on our baby's body. Plus you can use them for everything - wiping their face, wiping down toys, play mats, etc.	&&&
This is really great for taking to college! Nothing is ever clean at school so it's always nice knowing I have these wipes to clean a mess or sanitize something.	&&&
Great wipes, like the travel pack closure feature, it keeps the wipes moist.	&&&
Good product and does the job	&&&
Product works well for my daughter's skin wound	&&&
I keep buying these great wipes for my baby and my dogs paws for after he comes in from walks outside. These wipes are outstanding and the price....you can't beat the price point. These wipes are tough. They are thick my little baby has some messy jobs and two wipes do the trick. They are great for sensitive skin. My.baby is 3 months old and we have not experienced any diaper rash or rash from these wonderful wipes. They also hold strong for my dogs paws.He is a wonderful pit bull and his paws get cleaned after every outside walk again these wipes do not rip fall apart. They are unscented Hypoallergenic and I just love these wipes. I even use them for myself. Great for removing eye makeup with your favorite make up remover. I also use them for personal use. These wipes also last me a month. I have looked at all other places for all these wipes at this price and Amazon beats every store out there. I am a Huggies fanatic. I highly recommend these wipes. Great price durable great for my babies gentle skin. This is one happy Mommy. Oh also not toxic to my doggie that licks his paws.Love Huggies. Oh I did the pull test where you tug on the wipes and these are extremely sturdy. I cant say enough. Also Amazon got these delivered on Easter Sunday...thank you!	&&&
They finished fast and poop cgoes thru	&&&
I have to open the warmer up tp get wipes out. trying to pull them through the hole does not work.	&&&
Great wipes. They are a little dryer than most of the wipes I have purchased in the past. They also have a slight scent.	&&&
I always have to have wipes at home I don't care how old I am they just make you feel extra clean. And these are flushable and inexpensive.	&&&
Pampers are very nice; I have no babies, but these I use to baby me.	&&&
These wipes are good to keep in bathrooms and the kitchen. They are handy and do a great job.	&&&
The only Wipes I buy for my boys, it's really great and it's no expensive at all. We also can use them for clean hands and faces.	&&&
These wipes are very effective. I have tried many different facial wipes meant to remove makeup and others that are just meant to cleanse your face. These are the best of both worlds. One side it flat and soft for you to remove your eye makeup the other side is rougher,in essence, an exfoliating wipe that cleanses your face. I like that it is a deep cleaning wipe because the soft,thin ones that some companies make do not make you feel as if you have cleaned your face.at all.This is perfect for me because I have oily,sensitive skin and these are fragrance free and also have aloe ,green tea and vitamin e to keep your skin soft. They are nice to throw in your purse or bag when you exercise or hit the gym,they will help your face feel fresh. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.	&&&
I love this product and brand! I specifically love these wipes to clean the stove! Literally one swipe and majority of the oils leftover on the stove top are wiped clean!! I use these wipes to clean everything! Spills, dirt, dust! Very handy wipes that never dry out!	&&&
"I honestly thought these were the silliest things for the longest time, why can't a normal wipe be just as good I thought..
Until my second child's first cold, when my sister in law had me borrow hers after raving about them. I still didn't think I'd really love them. But I do. They are so great at getting all the little crusty stuff and boogies...I'll never go back to regulaar wipes with my little ones."	&&&
I like how saturated they are.	&&&
Great Product!	&&&
I got 16 of these using my Prime pantry credit.... I paid like $1.50 for all 16 of them.... but seriously I couldn't let Amazon Keep the $36.00 I had in credits right.... So now I have 16 of these and my bum will be clean for a long time to come!	&&&
Great value	&&&
These wipes work well.	&&&
We love these wipes. They're not slimy. our daughter doesn't break out from it. Great for hand clean up too.	&&&
Maybe my expectations for these wipes were too high, but I was pretty disappointed. My first complaint is that these wipes are way too dry! They barely even feel moist, so that makes me doubt how well my baby's bottom is being cleansed. Secondly, the packaging could use some improvements. The packaging itself is very sturdy, and I love that these have the plastic flip-top seal, but the top access is definitely too small. The wipes themselves are fairly thick and of quality material, but because they are EXTREMELY dry, I will not be purchasing these again. I will say that I do like the ingredients and the faint yet pleasant fragrance of these wipes, emphasizing very faint because I am not a fan of any other wipe with fragrance.	&&&
These are by far the best wipes I've ever used. I have five children so I have used many different wipes. Huggies wipes are the most durable, clean the most efficient and rarely break or tear while being used. I won't buy any other wipe.	&&&
Overall, a good wipes dispenser. I had some trouble getting the green lid to open and close & now just open the main white lid which.	&&&
My baby has my very sensitive skin and these and the sensitive skin wipes are the only ones that don't irritate my baby's skin. They are also extremely soft and strong.	&&&
Im a member of Smiley 360 and I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have had 2 children and developed hemorrhoids from the natural births. I am lucky that they only flare up every once in awhile. I have tried the regular Preparation H and I liked them but when I got a chance to use preparation h medicated wipes for women, I love them. They worked right away to soothe the situation. I really liked the aspect of them being designed just for women and have a scent to them. They are easy to use and easy to travel with.	&&&
yeah!!	&&&
Excellent product. Keeps my sensor in place for continuous glucose monitor. Thanks to all posters who recommended this. I have not had a sensor fall off since I started using these wipes. I did purchase the skin-tac remover wipes but they are a bit pricey & alcohol wipes work just as well.	&&&
Works as advertised. Great product to arrest unwanted perspiration.	&&&
Great for quick clean ups!!! Easy to use and just toss them when finished!!!"	&&&
I prefer to use this over those goofy drop in things because this actually gets your toilet clean and it makes the bathroom smell pretty good. I love the smell of bleach though so maybe that is why I love the smell of this stuff. "	&&&
I find that with a lot of makeup wipes, they burn my eyes, but not these ones. These are my favourite of the wipes I've tried (and I've tried a few!). I have sensitive skin, and they don't irritate it at all. I've never had any redness/itchiness after using these. I usually only wear mascara & sometimes foundation or eye shadow, and they do perfectly to remove the little makeup I wear. They may not be great for people who wear more makeup than I tend to. My only qualm is that they're pretty expensive at about $8.50 for 25 wipes.	&&&
My son has extremely sensitive skin and is very fair complexed and these are the only wipes I can use on him that do not break him out into a rash. I absolutely love them, if the store I am at is out of them I will drive to another store just to get them. Plus, I love that they are super thick and do not rip when I pull them out of the container or while I'm using them. Also, with them being so thick I don't have to use a lot of them when changing my son, which saves me money and saves waste. I recommend these wipes to literally every person I see with a baby, especially new mothers. I'm so happy that the hospital I delivered my son at used them or I probably would have never known about them. Great job pampers! Thank you for making such a great product! It's nice to get more than what you pay for for once! :)	&&&
One of the best products I've used on my son. It's a Decent price.	&&&
Great for cloth wipes! I only wish the labeling stickers weren't so hard to remove!	&&&
I really like Clorox brands they are easy to use i have some of the wipes does anyone else use this brand	&&&
Best wipes I've ever used! Unscented, no harmful chemicals! Plus they are thick and have a slight texture to them to help make diaper changes quick and easy. Compared to other natural wipes, these blow them out of the water. With other brands I've used, several more wipes need to be used to get the same kind of clean.	&&&
I only had to use one wipe to remove all of my makeup. These wipes left my skin feeling clean and soft. Didn't have to scrub my face raw to get the make up of either. I will be buying these again!	&&&
Have used all the wipes and recently Ordered Wright's Silver Cream which is so much better! I couldn't believe how bright and shiny the silver looked!	&&&
These are great! Im one of those people that doesnt like getting sick and tries really hard to prevent it, especially since I have a baby and these wipes come in handy for that. I use them on my counters, tables, bathroom, doorknobs.	&&&
These wipes are gentle but very effective. I would definitely recommend them.	&&&
"My baby hates the shock of cold wipes so I wanted to try this. And it works like a charm. It comes with a car charger so it can stay warm when traveling and running errands. It's a little bigger than a normal plastic wipe holder so it doesn't fit in my folding on the go changing pad but I don't mind. The wipes stay warm for a while after unplugged if you don't open the lid letting the heat out. You have to charge it for about an hour to get the first few wipes warm. So it's not instantaneous! But totally worth the planning it takes to plug it in. I get more compliments on this product from other moms and friends. Every mom who has a baby that cries from cold wipes should try this."	&&&
I got the 10 pack and they are so tiny! A little bigger then the palm of my hand. But they do remover all my makeupmakeup though my eye makeup is a little tougher I just set the padbon there for 30ish seconds and gently massage the lashes to remove water proof mascara	&&&
The cloths are nice and big, they come saturated in product so one cloth is more than enough to remove all of your makeup, and the textured side is a really nice addition. I'm giving this a meh rating because the actual makeup removing liquid burned my skin SO BADLY. I don't have sensitive skin and I had to stop using these after one use. I feel terrible returning products so I've been using these to remove makeup from my brushes before I wash them. The textured side is actually great for breaking down makeup that's deep in the bristles haha.	&&&
They work well and smell great. I keep them in my car and at work. I have had several people ask me about them after they have "borrowed" some from me.	&&&
I have used these for years. No issues. Maybe you find a dud or two in the entire 200 count box. For my recent delivery each individual wipe has "New" in red on it. I have no idea what is new. The formula has definitely changed as they smell differently. Also, the wipes seem to leave more lint/dust on my glasses. My biggest issue is that at least 1 in 5 wipes is a dud. Open the package and completely dry and useless wipe is revealed. What a ripoff!!!!!!!!!!!	&&&
These wipes are very good and soft.	&&&
Found them better than kirkland and huggies wipes.. thanks amazon !	&&&
"We use these daily, one place or another, as part of our cleaning routine. They work well for bathrooms, kitchens, and pretty much anywhere you want to clean and disinfect. They have enough fluid to be useful but not so much that they drip.

While you might prefer one of the available scents to the others, I've found them all to be equally unoffending, so I suspect you'd be fine with either of them. Well, maybe I might prefer the orange a bit, followed by the citrus, but it's not a strong preference.

Note that you can also bring these while traveling to wipe down the room - it's a great and quick way to help reduce the chance of catching something that might be going around locally.

It's also nice - if you have the space, and especially if you have kids - to keep some in the car.

Were I to request one change, it'd be to make them a bit rougher - they clean well, but they do a less efficient job of pulling the larger items (crumbs, hair, other grossities) along with the wipe, and often I'll end up needing a paper towel or similar to finish. For dust, dirt, and other small things, this isn't an issue."	&&&
These have been our favorite wipes by far! Free of toxic chemicals, durable, don't leave residue or fibers behind, soft, and gentle. These were the only wipes I would use when baby was first born. But now we are using another natural brand only because I received them (and a ton more) as a gift. I am missing my Water Wipes! I see the difference in quality and may just put the other wipes on hold and get another box of these!	&&&
We have tried so many brands of baby wipes. We started out with Parent's choice from walmart, then Target's up&up brand and now these. They are a tad more expensive than the previous brands we were using but they are so much better. They are thick, sturdy and just wet enough to provide a good cleaning. Also I love the plastic container that is offered with them. I leave one in every room of the house, we always have wipes available and they do not dry like in those flimsy individual packages! Also with Amazon's Subscribe&Save it is cheaper than at the store!	&&&
these cases are cute but it fell apart after a few uses, also you can purchase this at Walmart for about $2.50	&&&
These wipes are great. Clean my glasses very well. Also works well on my cell and ipad. Will be purchasing more when I get low.	&&&
I would have preferred that each package have and open and close top.	&&&
"Huggies wipes are the cheapest high quality wipes ive used. I love that although its tough and it wipes off messes it doesn't give my daughter any allergic reactions, no rash or redness."	&&&
I did not find the wipes to be dry in my order. They are convenient to carry and very soothing. Recently, I scratched the area just under my eye, and using the wipes calmed the irritation in the area immediately. The wipes keep my eyelids from flaking and itching so much, and wearing my contacts is much easier and more comfortable. I highly recommend these wipes for eye irritation or just to soothe tired eyes.	&&&
they are great. they are everything I expected them to be and more. love them.	&&&
I love these wipes and this multipack is great as it comes with a wipes case, refill packs for it as well as travel packs for the diaper bag. Great price too! These last me over a month but I do the subscribe and save to take advantage of the discount.	&&&
A most excellent product! My wife and I have both been using these for over a year now. We have them in all our bathrooms and cars - you never know when you don't want to be without a refreshing moist wipe. We have used other products in the past and were occasionally disappointed to find a dried out piece of paper with those other products. We have never opened a Dude Wipe and not found a super moist, perfect size, moderately scented, refreshing wipe.	&&&
I liked them but my husband had a hard time pulling them out while holding down a baby. I usually pull out a few first so they work fine for me. I also use them to remove my makeup at night. We reordered.	&&&
These wipes said they were scent free, but they had a very distinct smell. :(	&&&
Love this!! Fits way more wipes than expected!	&&&
I've tried other brands of wipes. While there are better ones out there with a higher price tag. I feel like i like this enough to pay for it. I like that it doesn't leave a residue like other popular brands.	&&&
I was looking for the individually wrapped hair color remove wipes, but these will do nicely!	&&&
"I should have read the fine print because I did not realize this was a pack of 4! Oh well, guess I'll be prepared for a lifetime. I saw other people complain about the smell but I do not think it's bad at all. If anything, Preperation H is the one with the weird smell.
Anyway, product works just as well.
Full disclosure: I don't use these for hemorrhoids. I use them to reduce eye puffiness and the occasional blemish. However, should I ever get a hemorrhoid, I shall be well prepared."	&&&
I love this stuff. Its the best. I always keep stocked up on it. It comes out of the container easily, and wipes up large areas and make the room smell nice. Love it!	&&&
"My wife absolutely LOVES these cleansing wipes!!! She has used them every morning & night!!! She says they work GREAT at removing her makeup & makes her face feel refreshed!!! She said to highly recommend this product!!!

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review!"	&&&
I love the simplicity of these wipes. So easy to just grab one from the tub, and get to wipin! The smell can still be kind of strong at first until it dries and airs out a bit. They make me feel like my house is cleaner and less germ-y, especially with a dog!	&&&
At first I thought it would smell awful, just like bleach, but when I got to use one while at a friend's house, I was surprised that it didn't smell bad at all. I got myself a pack after that. It's very handy at home our outside. It really disinfects and cleans well. Better than baby wipes and Lysol, for me.	&&&
It is good!	&&&
These wipes are good in the fact that they are individually wrapped, but they are somewhat dry. Other brands that I have tried are wetter and therefore they are able to clean your hands better. But, these get the job done and that is what is important.	&&&
All time favorite wipes have been using for years!!! Used on my first child and now my second.	&&&
Our favorite wipes, love that these don't contain chemicals that some brands do.	&&&
the bottom half of the bags of wipes are really soggy. That was an easy fix- I just squeezed them over the sink. The real problem is that they tear easily. Not cool when you're changing a wiggly & poppy toddler. :-/	&&&
works as expected, but you could really use any type of wipe. The point is to remove the oil left on the mask from your face for a good airtight fit.	&&&
I like Clorox wipes for easy cleaning of the bathroom. I user it for the countertop, sink faucet and toilet.	&&&
I got these wipes and another brand that was a little cheaper as Amazon baby registry gifts. I just ordered more since they're so much better than the little red surged wipes. I only need one to clean the mess no matter how dirty an EBF diaper is. They're soft, don't stick together when wet or dry and they hold just enough water.	&&&
Be careful not to get childs or your finger stuck inside	&&&
These baby wipes are my favorite! Smells so clean and fresh and works very well. I find that most wipes irritate my baby's delicate bottom as they are a little rough and dry but these wipes are soft and moist just perfectly. I even have tubs of these in every bathroom in our house as the husband and I love to use these on ourselves as well. They are so much better than toilet paper alone.	&&&
As always, a great product. These are the only wipes my kids can use without developing some sort of rash. Every single one of my kids have had a problem with other wipes.	&&&
Thank goodness for this subscription.. I never worry about running out of wipes! I love the all natural wipes too.	&&&
I love Huggies wipes. I use them on my child and myself. They are the only wipes I can use with my allergies.	&&&
"My boys have really bad allergies during spring and all the nose blowing irritates their little noses. boogie wipes work great and prevent snores in the nose cause by to my nose blowing. One of my sons will not let me use anything but boogie wipes."	&&&
Great price!	&&&
"I really like this product. I use it during late night feedings when my daughter's diaper needs changing. The night light allows me to see what I am doing without being too abrasive to wake her up more than necessary. Also the wipes are not as cold and alarming to her bum."	&&&
"This product is a MUST have for every house, car, diaper bag and purse. I keep boogie wipes on hand at all times, especially during cold season. My kids no longer complain when they go to blow their noses because Boogie Wipes makes it feel so much better. They are hands down better than a regular tissue and smell better too!"	&&&
This was a great deal! They are just as good as Huggies. I don't have to use no more, than I do when using Huggies wipes. Will buy again!	&&&
"I find that these makeup remover towelettes have the perfect amount of moisture for me. I have previously had a problem with other brands being too moist/wet, especially when you get to the bottom of the package. These are just moist enough to remove makeup, and won't make a mess.
They have small ""dots"" on them in order to exfoliate skin, which is a good addition to makeup remover wipes. The packaging is easy to access. The scent is nice and pleasant. As far as skin texture/quality after using this product, I did not notice any difference, but I already use several other products in addition to these wipes. My skin was not sticky or uncomfortable immediately after using these, so that was a plus. My eye makeup was completely removed (I tend to wear a fair amount of eye makeup including eyeliner, eyeshadow/primer, eyebrow gel/color). Overall, I think these are a good buy. The only reason for 4/5 stars was due to finding it difficult to separate these wipes from many others on the market--while they were pleasant to use and ""did the job,"" I didn't find that they were that much improved from many other makeup remover wipes I have used in the past."	&&&
A terrific product that helped resolve our pug's skin problems.	&&&
I love these wipes and I love buying them in bulk. It makes life easier to buy them all at once!	&&&
As others have posted, the wipes dry up fairly quickly-- I'd say within a couple weeks. I had hoped to keep this in the diaper bag, but it's essentially useless for this purpose.	&&&
Changed the packaging. Don't like the thickness..too thin for me	&&&
Great item.fast shipping	&&&
When I tried in the store, it seemed fine on my hands. But using it at home on my face, the exfoliating side of the wipes hurt. Not worth the price and I may return back to the store.	&&&
I love Clorox disinfecting wipes! They get the job done every time.	&&&
Great wipes. Work well, keep the bottoms clean. Also amazing price!	&&&
"Care" product does not work as well as the old cleaner product did. I can not find it anywhere	&&&
I love this flushable wipes so much! It is wonderful for potty-training kids. They can wipe it clean all by themselves! And we also use it to clean kids' hands and faces when we go outside! It is convenient!	&&&
Good I recommen it	&&&
Before my daughter was born I went crazy buying wipes without giving a second thought of wether or not her skin would be as sensitive as mine is. Other branded wipes irritated her little bum until during a quick shopping trip I discovered pampers made a sensitive line. Our problems solved within days of using her redness ebbed away the pampers sensitive diapers are amazing as well. Overall I use these for everything and will continue to buy these even after she is done diapering .	&&&
This is ok. Didn't expect the white film to be harder to rub off as others	&&&
I think I am addicted to the scent of these. I love them. I use them on my one-year-old son's face and he doesn't fight me with these like he does with the Boogie Wipes.	&&&
I love these disinfecting wipes. One container is kept handy in both bathrooms and kitchen. When something needs to be cleaned and disinfected there is a convenient disposable wipe there to do the job. These things also cut greese very well. Great for quick clean up jobs on the stove top.	&&&
I worried when reading the recent reviews that Costco had changed these wipes. I've been ordering them for years - they're the best wipes. They're larger & thicker than any others I've tried. I was happy to see when they arrived that they're the same as always.	&&&
Love these wipes. They are so handy to just wipe down any surface quickly. I even use them in my car for the cup holders and other sticky areas! Would definitely recommend.	&&&
Great value for the money! Bought these for a shower gift. Lots of wipes! Couldn't beat the quanity and quality	&&&
These wipes are perfect to use in the house with kids. They really clean up the mess and are pretty safe for children	&&&
This combined with the disposable wash cloths is the most awesome item I have ever added to my craft room. No more smelling baby wipes.	&&&
These wipes are good in the fact that they are individually wrapped, but they are somewhat dry. Other brands that I have tried are wetter and therefore they are able to clean your hands better. But, these get the job done and that is what is important.	&&&

Air gets in and lets the wipes dry out, so I don't put too many in there at this point. I like the size of it though.	&&&

This product is a MUST have for every house, car, diaper bag and purse. I keep boogie wipes on hand at all times, especially during cold season. My kids no longer complain when they go to blow their noses because Boogie Wipes makes it feel so much better. They are hands down better than a regular tissue and smell better too!	&&&
Smells good, and I use it to clean my kid's hands and face befor meals, very gentle for kids.	&&&
Wipes leaked box wet.	&&&
I have the matching wipes holder in the nursery and it's great. I assumed this travel case would be just as wonderful, how wrong I was! It doesn't seal totally and so the wipes dry out. I wouldn't recommend this unless you're using all the wipes the same day as you put them in this case.	&&&
My baby has eczema and after solids introduction cleaning her face with organic cotton cloth wipes increased the dryness on her cheeks. I purchased several washcloth brands that were recommended because of their softness. The Under the Nile were thick, great for wiping hands, but still rough for her face. The Satsuma were really soft, but a little thin. These Bamboobino were softer than those two brands and just the right thickness.	&&&
I've been using these for a few months now and I'm very happy with them. A case holds enough wipes to cover an explosive BM and still have a few to spare. Its compact. Works well with Pampers wipes. Perfect for a shorter trip out. I'm not sure if they improved the product or not because I have had no problems with the zipper like other reviews said.	&&&
Ok wipes but I find I have to use more then I normally do and they tend to rip very easily when cleaning your baby creating more mess	&&&
My grandson has extremely sensitive skin and we can't use a number of the name brand baby wipes as they make him break out in a rash. The Kirkland brand has worked great for us over the last 18 months. I buy mine directly at Costco but the price is really reasonable if you aren't near a Costco or don't have a card. I use these as my hand wipes, too, and they work great for that purpose.	&&&
My baby hates the shock of cold wipes so I wanted to try this. And it works like a charm. It comes with a car charger so it can stay warm when traveling and running errands. It's a little bigger than a normal plastic wipe holder so it doesn't fit in my folding on the go changing pad but I don't mind. The wipes stay warm for a while after unplugged if you don't open the lid letting the heat out. You have to charge it for about an hour to get the first few wipes warm. So it's not instantaneous! But totally worth the planning it takes to plug it in. I get more compliments on this product from other moms and friends. Every mom who has a baby that cries from cold wipes should try this.	&&&
Got this after my newborn son would cry during changing from the cold wipes. The wipes are just the right temperature and I've never had a problem with them drying out or turning brown. The light isn't really enough for changing at night unless it's just pee in the diaper. I also don't find the window in front useful because it's always covered with water droplets making it hard to see the wipe level. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.	&&&
"A few weeks ago I heard a municipal wastewater operator report that these and other similar products are damaging the plant because ""they don't break down like paper"". He will notice his own customers and will ask the company to remove the claim that the wipes are "" safe for sewer systems"". This individual remarked that the wipes are likely not safe for septic systems either. I had not noticed customer reviews here warning septic tanks households of the danger of using these when I purchased the ""flushable wipes."" I had recently had my septic tanks pumped out and after the pumping had started using these wipes. .After hearing the wastewater manager I called the septic pumping company I patronize and had my tanks pumped. Sure enough, the wipes had formed this gummy mass and clearly would have occluded the drainage pipes if left alone. I paid extra to have them manually removed.

The BOTTOM LINE is that these wipes should not be used by anyone until their formulation is changed and they are not needed either. I now keep an attractive ceramic flask filled with tap water near my toilet .and when I feel the need I moisten regular toilet paper and clean with that."	&&&
Total crap. The wipes always dry out. I ended up trashing it and using the disposable wipe containers. Waste of money.	&&&
Using the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are the best way to clean. Just one wipes clean a great deal!!!!	&&&
This is the best Baby Wipes!!	&&&
These are great for traveling.	&&&
works well and nice cleaner to use to clean the seats and interior of the car. takes about 5 or 6 wipes to thoroughly clean the entire inside of the car. would reccommend	&&&
"Pediatrician's comment upon examining our baby = ""What a beautiful diaper area!"" (she actually exclaimed in surprise) Our pediatrician is very holistic and was happy to learn of a new product she can recommend to parents. These wipes have a faint herbal smell -- thus the name Clearly HERBAL....
My friend from England had told me about these and I'm glad they are finally available in the US.
Just wish they stocked Amazon regularly.
We've been using these for 8 months and have had zero issues. The compliment our pediatrician gave us was testimony enough."	&&&
I love these things and the price here was good too.	&&&
Works well, but these are the small cans.	&&&
Love these wipes. Once you start using moistened wipes as part of your routine, you will never feel clean without them again. I have compared these to several other brands and always come back to there. Love the smell of them too. Charmin, please don't change the fragrance.	&&&
As a member of Smiley360, I was able to try these for free in exchange for a review and these are totally my own opinion of the product. The first thing I noticed about these wipes was the scent. It smells good and it not a strong scent at all but very soothing and relaxing. Although these are mainly for hemorrhoids I feel they can be used anytime to freshen up down there which I think most all women at some point feels not so fresh down there sometimes. However if you do get hemorrhoids, which luckily I don't get often but occasionally do, they work great for them. Those I let try them who get them more than I, had only great things to say about them and say they recommend them for anyone who gets hemorrhoids, especially women who have just given birth. Overall I myself definitely recommend the wipes. They smell good, they work great and they are from a very trusted brand in my opinion. Also the price for them is a very decent price and so worth buying.	&&&
Wipes have lots of moisture leaving baby feeling clean & fresh. One gentle sweep is all it takes. Great for bottom, hands and feet.	&&&
The best one we use so far...	&&&
I keep a bit of these in my school bag, I like the clean fresh feeling. I love all they're products"	&&&
Its a very good product I have the whole collection its just so soothing and takes care of my skin."	&&&
We love Pampers! We preffer unscented, the more natural, the better.	&&&
Love these wipes for my twins sensitive skin!!! Great job pampers	&&&
i love using this brand i use to use always but then i heard about this one and omg feel so comfy i always "	&&&
Great for sensitive skin	&&&
We have been using these wipes for a while now and we like them quite a bit. They are thick and get the job done without all the harsh chemicals other wipes tend to have. We use them for diaper changes, but also for wiping the kids' faces when we are out and do not have a regular washcloth to use.	&&&
I won these in a giveaway and i liked these it got the makeup off my face really well didnt have to do alot of repeats"	&&&
worth buying	&&&
Wonderful if you want to keep things natural in the modern world! Healthy and safe! Just what we wanted!	&&&
Perfect for my diaper bag! But it holds minimal amount of wipes and sometimes if there's too many wipes its hard to close but stays shut once its closed	&&&
works nicely..no rubbing to further irritate	&&&
Awesome bag...good price...strong...big....looks good...material long lasting....just buy it	&&&
My newborn and I have very sensitive skin. The brand the hospital used irritated her skin, but made my hand bright red! These are the only wipes that I'll buy. I actually used them for years for my pet; good for rear, paws, and shedding.	&&&
I love these wipes they are my number one I do not use anything else these work great and smell great too	&&&
i totally love these, they help alot better then the regular wipes, i got temporary relief of irritation and burning and love the way they are infused with refreshing cucumber, soothing aloe, vitamin E, shea butter and chamomile i believe thats wat makes these better and more effective. I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. i recommend to any women who suffer from hemorrhoids	&&&
Wipes are great, as usual. These canisters are junk, as usual. I didn't buy this for the can. They work great and my DD loves them.	&&&
I love these wipes.......the make your skin feel and look amazing and it keeps your skin moist.Hey its also packed with loads at Vitamin C "	&&&
"its true they are very wet. but when it comes to cleaning your baby potty a real good wet wipe helps. lol.
good price good packaging doesnt dry up fast and arrives on time. happy with my purchase."	&&&
These are the wipes that I started with when I brought my older daughter came along. They work extremely well and they are very soft. They have a pleasant scent if you like products with fragrance. I have switched to the Naturals because I love products with aloe, but if I can't find those in the store, I grab these without hesitation. Perfect basic wipe for the indecisive or newcomer to the world of diapering. Pampers is doing something great here.	&&&
very convenient and pleased	&&&
I started using these because of their price, and I've kept using them because of how high quality they are. Pampers are definitely softer and thicker, but these are WAY stronger. I was so bummed when they were recalled and I had to use pampers...they would rip all the time. So glad these are back!!!	&&&
These are a pretty bad deal. The wipes are smaller and not as efficient as pampers ones so you're using many more to get the job done	&&&
Theres not really much you could say about wipes except it really cleans. Between the price and the way it cleans its perfect.	&&&
This was our first experience with pampers wipes. Although they got the job done and were durable, they were so thick they all stuck together and came out in multiples rather than one at a time.	&&&
"These wipes start loosing their wetness way too fast. I have had to pour a mix of water and baby wash over them to keep them from drying. The dryer they are the rougher it is in baby's bottom :(
I will not be getting these again."	&&&
This is the best product I could have gotten. Easy to apply and remove. Headlights on my 2003 car look brand new!!!!	&&&
We love the smell and disinfecting power of these wipes!	&&&
These are my favorite wipes!! I have used them with all of my kids. They are super durable and do not smell.	&&&
great strong wipes	&&&
We won't buy baby wipes in stores again EVER!	&&&
Yes I love this product espically for around the house with two kids! We constantly have some kind of sticky mess and these Clorox wipes do an amazing job!	&&&
these are so handy. i have pets and kids and these are a lifesaver. when we have a small spill it is so much more handy to use a wipe and they are great for wiping down there toys. they clean real well	&&&
Much thicker quality than the huggies wipes I have been using. Reminds me of seventh generation wipe quality with out the price. Glad I switched. These are now my go to brand.	&&&
"It was great to be able to clean my kitchen, bathrooms, refrigerator, walls, tables, lamps, bathroom doorknobs, kitchen doorknobs, basement bathroom. I also cleaned my unit window air conditioners. I can wipe down almost anything such as the remote control, the dog cage, furniture, the dvds that I get from Netflix or Red box. I use them to clean my cars, the handles on my tools. I use them to wipe down the vacuum cleaner. I use them to wipe off my pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, silver dollars and fifty cent pieces."	&&&
The wipes are a little dry, but smell good and are very convenient when you need to clean a pacifier or your little one's hands.	&&&
Clorox wipes are fantastic no matter what job you need them to do!! Wouldn't trust any other brand =)	&&&
Love these wipes! The texture and smell are nice. The are great to use for any kind of quick cleaning!	&&&
We use these wipes for the new baby they never seemed to bother her delicate skin and were priced very well.	&&&
Good product. No irritation.	&&&
I'm am 100% Huggies wipes supporter. If you are too you understand. Pampers are a weird texture and leave a greasy residue. Costco brand changed and they don't work well etc. Anyway, Amazon had a great price on their Elements wipes. I figured Amazon is all about quality and they were really inexpensive. If they remain less expensive than Huggies I will make the switch. I have been using them over 3 months now and am very happy with them. They have a cotton-like feel like huggies and work just as well without leaving residue. I was pleasantly surprised and have happily made the switch.	&&&
Not enough for the money.	&&&
Awesome! Love amazon!	&&&
These wipes work like they are suppose to, and make cleaning the mask everyday and easy chore. I recommend these wipes highly, plus the price is much better then buying from a medical supply company.	&&&
"These wipes are the best thing ever, no one likes a snotty nose and these wipes are soft and gentle. It makes it really easy to wipe a tiny nose and my grandson loves the Grape smell! I love them and there is nothing I don't like."	&&&
Huggies are absolutely the best of all baby wipes. Even Pampers aren't as good. Can be a good deal when you buy in large quantities and on sale. All the other brands merely smear around poop (sorry to be graphic but it's true!). Huggies somehow developed a type of fiber that really gets your baby cleaned up without the extra frustration that already entails messy diaper changes. Other parents I know agree! Don't waste your money on other brands.	&&&
Love these wipes! They are very soft and the tub is nice and sturdy.	&&&
"While we are big fans of Seventh Generation products, these wipes are pathetic.

There's 2 kinds of SG wipes for sale on Amazon, the new ones--a super thick, soft and very absorbant wipe and these that (I believe) have been discontinued by SG.

Don't buy these. They are like those thin wipes in a packet they give you when you eat messy food. It will take upwards of 8 wipes to clean your baby's bottom and even then it leaves this residue (which causes my child to rash).

Very disappointed."	&&&
Great product! Doesn't burn or dry out my daughter's skin. I use these wipes for everything!	&&&
The only wipes that don't make my children break out in a rash. Love Pampers Sensitive Wipes.	&&&
great salon product. I use it at my color stations. I use them in place of a towel. So the color won't stain the towel.As a nice benefit the hands are left feeling soft and clean.	&&&
One of the best products in along time. Great for throwing in as extra clean up cloths, baby wipes or whatever is needed. About the size of a nickle till you add a couple of drops of water. Then they can expand up to a 9 x 12 towelette that are soft.. Would be great for camping, keeping in the car or your purse for those just in case moments. I will be sharing with everybody about them. FANTASTIC.	&&&
Clorox disinfecting wipes is a must in my home and on the go! Im always having friends and relatives come over the house for get togethers and well, "you just never know". I always have to have the bathroom area safe and clean especially for myself and my kids. The wipes pop up and I use the lemon scent wipes.	&&&
Love the wipes! They are the ones we have used since day one. My only reservation is using them when my son gets a bit of diaper rash. They are just to harsh on his sensitive skin. Those are the times warm washcloths work best.	&&&
After many yrs of working with children I have found these wipes to be good and durable with minimal irritation like many wipes. Will def be using on my new grandbabies	&&&
This is a staple in my desk drawer at work. I always keep them handy for those stains right before an important meeting. "	&&&
Great for cleaning up messes and dirt quickly.	&&&
these are amazing we have them at work (a daycare) and I used them all the time there not rough on the kids noses like tissues so they don't put up as much a fight "	&&&
I would order again if needed.	&&&
"I love the Honest Company!
These wipes have a low rating from the environmental working group, and work so well! They are made with biodegradable cloth (that composts in municipal/ industrial facilities), and their packaging is recyclable!
They are really great soft and thick wipes for diapers and more!"	&&&
These are a little more costly than other brands, but they also do not have the pungent odor that many cleaning supplies have.	&&&
Just what I wanted.	&&&
Thank you	&&&
These are my favorite face wipes. I have 2 teenage daughters and all three of us use these every night to wash our faces before going to bed. To be honest, we are just too lazy to wash with facial soap and water (and I hate that water get in your hair and down your shirt!). We just pop these wipes out and get the makeup off in seconds. All three of us have sensitive skin and these wipes don't make our faces turn red like other brands do.	&&&
I will definetly recommend this	&&&
These are really awesome wipe. For one they are a great value, especially when they go on sale. They have a great smell and really for the job of wiping the baby up."	&&&
packaging sucks, there is no seal on the tops of the bottles and they are packed in a cardboard box so when it gets tossed the lids pop open and all the fluid drains out into the box, won't ever buy them again.	&&&
I love the convenience of Chlorox Wipes. My family swears that I'm going to develop tennis elbow from wiping with the Chlorox Wipes. I love that they disinfect as they clean. So much more sanitary than a dishcloth.	&&&
I ordered several different types of reusable wipes containers for the diaper bag to no avail. Eventually i gave up and started using the disposable plastic bags of wipes in the diaper bag. Nothing else holds enough wipes for emergencies. I especially didn't like this particular product. It was really hard to get the wipes out of the top and also they dried out inside it after awhile.	&&&
burns your skin!! bought it to remove eyebrow color off my skin.	&&&
i found these wipes to be very effective and would recommend them to anyone especially to women of menopause age.	&&&
Best deal on touch screen wipes I have found anywhere!	&&&
I use this product when I'm feeling to lazy and don't want to do my whole nightly face washing routine. Or to get rid of mascara/eyeliner leftover from sleeping. At first I didn't mind the smell, but after a few times using the wipes it makes me nauseous. It also does not, I repeat DOES NOT, remove all of your makeup. It'd nice for bei gon the go, but I wouldn't use it all of the time	&&&
I love these wipes! They are durable and I like that they are hypoallergenic and non toxic.	&&&
Could be coincidental, but as soon as we stopped using these wipes my baby's chronic yeast rash disappeared.	&&&
These pampers baby wipes are amazing. Ive always been. Fan of pamper products as they are made very well. With a dirty diaper it takes at most 3 wipes. And with competitor brands i takes double or triple the amount. I will always be loyal to pampers with such amazing products.	&&&
These are the only wipe I use and I've tried them all! I used to buy store brand sensitive wipes but since I switched to pampers I can use any of them since they are so soft they don't irritate my sons skin. Love these!!	&&&
Too small. Takes a ton of wipes to get the job done.	&&&
Great product! It takes more than one wipe; however, to clean multiple pieces of furniture. The dirt comes off fairly easily; although, the wipes themselves are a bit sticky. I used these on my wood furniture.	&&&
Love these! Perfect for work, all these yucky germs that go around the office. Amazon has some great deals for these disinfecting wipes.	&&&
work great	&&&
excellent product	&&&
I truly love the HUGGIES wipes I've tried othe brands but either their too dry, rough or wet and HUGGIES are just right.	&&&
They clean well (including eye makeup) and leave my face soft and moisturized. The big plus in water deprived California? I don't have to use water to wash my face at night! ;)	&&&
"These wipes are quite possibly the best I've used so far, and, for the price, are definitely a steal (I buy these on Subscribe & Save for $10.88).

The smell is a barely-there fresh scent, which, for people like me who have been graced with sensitive noses, is a blessing.

They are made with a sturdy material that doesn't rip as easily as some of the other leading brands (before switching to this product I had been using Pampers Natural Clean wipes, which are, in my opinion significantly thinner) and I am using fewer wipes per diaper change than I used to, which is definitely a plus.

I have noticed a difference in moisture retention in these wipes from Pampers as well (try facing a blowout with dried out wipes, I dare you!) but I have no idea whether this is because of their increased thickness or because since switching brands I have started buying refill packs that come in sealed bags instead of dispensers that might somewhat increase the amount of air the wipes are exposed to before you buy them.
Either way, it makes diaper changes a lot easier and this momma a lot happier!

I am a Prime member, so I get free two day shipping and have never had a problem with packaging.

Overall I give this product five stars, because I have encountered zero drawbacks in my history of purchase thus far.

Would recommend!"	&&&
Been using these on my son since he was born and never had an issue. It's gentle and does not have a funky smell like most wipes out there. One of these cases lasts me about 3 months so this is a good price. I must say Earths Best and The honest Company wipes are my top two brand of wipes that I will ever use on my son. I noticed when I have used other brands on occasions, my sons butt would turn a bit pink which I didn't like at all.	&&&
Love these wipes...perfect for on the go, and the visit with Mother Nature...	&&&
I use this mostly on nights when I am too tired to wash my face properly. I only wear face powder and these wipes remove every bit of it. I like that I don't have to rinse it off my skin if I don't feel like it. I have super sensitive skin and I have never been able to do that with any other product I've tried. I do recommend following with a moisturizer as I have tried skipping it and my skin did get a little dry.	&&&
These are the best wipes I have used.	&&&
Strong perfumy scent. I would not order again.	&&&
These things clean everything. I even use them to clean my toilet, bathtub, whatever. They work great!	&&&
I use them a lot as it is inexpensive. Reading the reviews, I always keep the packet sealed in a ziploc bag. So the wipes did not dry up.	&&&
These wipes are the only ones I would use. The other wipes from simple scratch the face. I would recommend these ones highly.	&&&
I really like these wipes! They are inexpensive and work great! They are nice thick wipes!	&&&
These are definitely a big money saver vs. store bought wipes plus GO GREEN!	&&&
Huggies diapers are the only diapers we use and wipes are no different. We trust Huggies with our babies sensitive skin. We even buy the wipes for my toddlers.	&&&
These are awesome; they open up large enough to clean well and they stay moist enough. Wish they had them back in the warehouse as they did in the past!	&&&
"i love clorox disinfecting wipes...i have one in the kitchen, tv room, and bathroom...they are always handy to have around the house so that is why i buy these in 3's...excellent.
i will get some more again..."	&&&
Used to buy these before the recall and was sad to see them go. Now they are back and you get more for less best wipes they never tear.	&&&
What every cpap user needs. Price is great compared too.	&&&
My son is sensitive to every other wipe out there that we have tried. These work the best for him and we've been buying them since he was about 2 months old (he's now almost 2 years old).	&&&
The wipes dry out very quickly when using them. It's probably due to the alcohol content in them. I'm finding that I'm having to use more wipes because of it. I'm more used to using wipes that stay wet while I wipe down equipment & mats. These wipes dry out before I finish wiping down equipment or mats.	&&&
I use these wipes everyday! I love using this on just about anything and everything and the smell isn't that strong at all.	&&&
I love to use this wipes on everyday cleaning. Use this everyday on my bathroom sink after everyone has used the bathroom. I use it in my kitchen as well after I finish cooking. Love the smell it leaves after. Very convenient, just pull one out and use.	&&&
LOVE, LOVE LOVE these things! We have officially subscribed to these babies. Whenever our baby girl gets sick we pull these out! She hates getting her nose wiped in the first place and these make the experience bearable. When she is sick and miserable looking, I feel good knowing that I can at least protect her nose from getting rough and sore. Well worth the money. Would HIGHLY recommend. In fact, I've used them myself and when your nose it sore it beats a tissue any day. (We also use the Boogie Wipes Saline Spray and love it equally as much)	&&&
Bad quality of wipes, it dry in your hands as soon as you take it out from the plastic. Don't waste your money on this product.	&&&
"We love these wipes. Nice and thick, you don't need to use several at a time to deal with the big messes. (I used target brands and they would bunch up when you swiped with them, so I ended up using two or three stacked on top of each other--- not necessary with these!). I like that they don't leave a film on baby's skin like Pampers (which are equally as thick and nice, but those things leave a slick film. yuck).
They stay nice and moist, and we buy these big packages which we use to keep refilling the hard container and the travel huggies case for the diaper bag-- which is an AWESOME invention, btw!!! I hate dealing with those little plastic packs with the little plastic tab on top that never sticks down well or sticks to the last wipe and makes them dry out or hard to pull out.
I never thought I'd be picky about wipes, but now that I've been a mom for over a year, I realize the little things *DO* make a big difference!"	&&&
Those two words almost never go together, but these wipes are both durable & affordable. I love that I don't have to worry about my baby's skin sensitivity when I use these wipes on her.	&&&
Of all the things in our nursery, these are the most in use!!! Super soft (and stay soft after washe without softener), natural, non irritating, and really easily washed. We use them for bathing, wiping bottom, absorbing open air pee and poop, instead of a bib, just for everything! Twelve is good, but I'm buying more because they've been discontinued.	&&&
I used to buy the wipes from Target but thought I'd give these a try and am very glad I did. Though the packages from Target contain 20 more wipes (assuming you buy the box) these are far more softer, thicker, and stronger and therefore last longer. And I get the added bonus of free 2 day shipping so will definitely continue to buy these	&&&
This was given to me as a gift. I have 2 small dogs and I use it to clean their paws, wipe their faces after they eat and clean their eyes. I have found it goes to good use for minor accidents at home that the dogs have caused. There is no strong scent, so I don't worry about it affecting the dog's skin.	&&&
I tend to bounce back and forth between these wipes and the Lysol wipes, depending on what's on sale. I really like them both actually and prefer to wipe down tables, countertops, etc. with them as opposed to other options. Disinfecting wipes are the best things!	&&&
I love it and so does Rascal. Thanks for making a great product that helps keep him clean and smell great too	&&&
Best wipes ever!!	&&&
"We bought a few boxes of Huggies Natural Care wipes thinking we were getting a great deal but to my dismay, these wipes are far from good.

The wipes come attached to each other and you need to tear them apart to be able to use them. I tried using a wipe dispenser but even with that the wipes do not pull apart. I filled the dispenser with a good amount of wipes in hopes of being able to pull them apart with one hand but only thing I was able to get were pieces of the wipes (it tore). In order to use them, I have to manually tear them apart from each other before I attempt to change a diaper.

I am done with these wipes and moving on to something else."	&&&
My 1st son has VERY sensitive skin. We used regular Pampers wipes at 1st and he developed a rash. Next we tried Huggies Natural wipes and the rashes continued. We switched to Pampers Sensitive wipes and the rashes stopped! They are a great option for babies with sensitive skin and as far as we can tell Amazon has had the best price.	&&&
These are the only wipes I will use on my babies! Free of fragrance these wipes are perfect for little ones with sensitive skin!	&&&
Great wipes, never worry about them not being thick enough, or not doing the job. Some wipes are flimsy, or too dry... These are perfect.	&&&
I just love these wipes! They make cleaning the skin so simple. They're soft yet durable like a washcloth. So sometimes when you pull one out one handed and it gets stuck, these wipes will just stretch until they come out as compared to other brands they will rip. I use less wipes to clean skin with these than other brands.	&&&
Shines beautifully. It does leave a bit of a film on granite however.	&&&
I buy Clorox wipes to use to wipe the counter tops or the dinner table off. I keep some in the car for those moments you make go somewhere that may not be cleaned.	&&&
These wipes are smaller and too thin. I have to use two or more at a time to feel like I have anything to work with. Even dollar general wipes are better than these.	&&&
Love these wipes they are a must have around the house . Perfect to help disinfect hard surfaces and doesn't leave behind any residue . The smell is pleasant and always have these in my house .	&&&
I bought this thinking it would last longer than huggies wipes and I was wrong. The wipes are extremely thin and wet and they don't last long at all.	&&&
I got these to clean the inside of my car. Works very well!	&&&
Large canisters that aren't very portable, tops that don't work properly so you have to pry them off and just pull the wipes out, very thin wipes that are more like largish wet-naps. Not nearly as good as No Rinse Bathing Wipes, which are more portable for bringing to the gym and easy to open and reseal. The No Rinse Bathing Wipes are also much thicker, softer, and larger. More like actual cloth/felt. Cost wise, two of these cost the same as one No Rinse, but I think that you'd easily use more than twice as many.	&&&
These are a must have for men and women.	&&&
I was really excited about this product because it's all natural and smells amazing. But when I went to apply lotion with a cotton swab after using these wipes, there was more foundation on my face! Unfortunately I will have to return these because I need to remove all my makeup before I sweat/workout.	&&&
"Best wipes ever. I use them to clean faces and wipe noses. They are very gentle and safe on my baby's delicate body all over. I like them better than boggie wipes because safer ingredients and don't smell.
I buy through honest.com and buy 25 packages at a time so they have always given me 25% off. I buy all their products. I haven found one I don't like yet."	&&&
Great product. Super fast delivery. Thank you.	&&&
I like the product but the container lid was broken in shipment which means that the products will most likely dry up before I use all the wipes. Very disappointed that no one responded to my first review.	&&&
It does a great job of keeping the wipes moist and very warm. The only downside for us is that we use it for disposable wipes so the top is inconvenient as it doesn't help pull the sheets apart.	&&&
"It's kind of terrible. It's too thin for using it without folding, and after you fold it and wipes, it moves and unfolds into a mess. The more you fold the more it moves around and you end up using 10 of them before you can get anything cleaned up. Huggies is ""one and done"" (true to slogan), this is like 10 and still not quite done.

Only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it is unscented like described and won't irritate your skin."	&&&
After recent surgery, these were just perfect for the sponge bath phase.	&&&
Love these! They are gentle on the nose and do not sting your nose if it is rubbed raw from tissues. The kids love them and are more willing to blow their noses because it will not irritate their nose. I do not buying them and spending the extra money. "	&&&
These are the best wipes! The ones in the bags always seem "dry" We box the box and the the refills and just keep refiling the box of wipes!	&&&
These are the best wipes for our baby's behind. We have tried a few other types- Kirkland (we found we used more wipes per diaper change, and that they weren't quite as soft), Huggies Natural Care (baby got red irritation on his bum), and Babyganics (no irritation, but didn't seem to clean up the mess easily). So, now we buy Pampers Sensitive Wipes exclusively. This particular box is nice because you get the three travel packs, one plastic tubs, and then a bunch of regular refills. We use the travel packs for the diaper bag, and then the rest for use at home. Since we have plenty of the plastic dispensers now, we keep one in the bedroom, one in the living room, and one in the trunk of the car for easy access.	&&&
I didn't purchase this until I was expecting my second, and I wish I would have bought it with my first. I've always been against unnecessary baby stuff, but this does actually make life easier. I primarily use WaterWipes and always just transfered them from their packaging into an old Huggies plastic case. The "free" wipes containers don't make life easy--I was always struggling to get just one wipe at a time or they wouldn't stay held in the teeth and I'd have to re-thread wipes far too often. This dispenser makes it easy for one wipe to come out at a time (one handed!) and the wipes are always ready to be pulled through.	&&&
I use moist wipes for a variety of things. I bought the dispenser and like 36 packs of wipes from Amazon in a bundle. The wipes themselves are barely damp at best. Secondly, you thread the outermost wipe through the dispenser and the rest should follow sequentially. Unfortunately, you have re-thread every other wipe through the dispenser because they don't flow through the dispenser well at all and just separate before making it through the threader hole. Thirdly, when the dispenser closes, it's not really air tight and even more of moisture from the wipes evaporates. I thought these would be a better bargain than buying what I usually purchase (Wet Ones brand). A bargain, they definitely are, but you get what you pay for. My preferred brand is anti-bacterial. Wet ones are also very wet and when you buy a canister of them. There is a reservoir of liquid solution inside the canister ensuring that the wipes stay wet. I love most Cottonelle products, but I'm not a fan of these moist wipes. Sorry.	&&&
Great! Love these wipes. Have not had any issues with this product. Strong enough to get even messy diaper changes done, yet still gentle on baby's skin.	&&&
Easy to use, and keep clean. I use these with alcohol to clean the tackiness off gel nails when done curing.	&&&
Very moist and cleans very well. nice size also and convenient.	&&&
I love this stuff. This is a great invention. When my little one is feeling sick and has a runny nose, this is the one thing that he will allow to come near his nostrils. He especially likes the grape fragrance."	&&&
This is one of my recommended Top 10 must haves for new Moms. It seems silly, but for a newborn who cries during diaper changes or an older squirmy baby, its important to be able to hold your baby with one hand and grab your wipes with the other and do this as quicky as possible! This weighted dispenser allows you to do that. It's easy to refill and buying wipes in bulk saves you money. It fits perfectly on top of my Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot. It's so great that when my son kicked it off of the changing table and it broke, we immediately bought a new one. It keeps the wipes moist so they never dry out its so easy even the grandparents can figure it out!	&&&
this is a wonderful product. my son has very sensitive skin so most wipes make him break out. the pampers natural wipes are the only wipes ive found that wont irritate his skin.	&&&
Handy!	&&&
All my cloth wipes smell mildewy, despite following the sanitation directions, bummer.	&&&
I researched diaper wipes a good amount, and decided that this is the one that works for my baby. I still think it's best to use water and organic cloth, but it's not always around, or just too messy. For those times, I use these wipes.	&&&
I used these with my little guy. Kinda thought it was a better idea to just by baby wipeds for the same idea"	&&&
I have used these wipes ever since my daughter was born. They do an excellent job. I would recommend these wipes to anyone looking for great quality. Always have been a proud user of Pampers products!!!	&&&
I have 7 year old twins and I carry these with me everywhere. I'm always needed to wipe their hands and faces. They come in handy and kill germs.	&&&
i love this product ! it's thicker and has no perfumes ,it will not harm my babies sensitive skin.and also does not rip apart .its perfect !	&&&
Good price. Cleaned what it needed to clean. And cleaned it well.	&&&
These are fabulous! Best eyeglass cleaner I have ever found!!	&&&
I have a large house that is completely floored in porcelain tile. We tried so many different products but the floor just never felt clean when I took my shoes off....and worse yet, when I walked in socks, the bottom of the socks showed me exactly how dirty the floor really was. I saw this product and wondered if something that did NOT cost a small fortune would really get the job done. I read all of the reviews and decided to go for it. I can not tell you how happy I am with this little jewel! It really is shocking to see the color of the water that is extracted from the floor. When I am done, I have CLEAN floors....and my sock feet prove it!	&&&
Great quality product I recommend it for people that don't have acne prone skin:)	&&&
So I bought these Veet Wax strips hoping to use them all over my body (legs, bikini, arms, underarms, etc.) I started with the legs and I am extremely dissatisfied. When you first apply the strip and use it once, it works perfectly. If you try to reuse it, the wax is completely off the strip and instead on your legs (!) so it doesn't work anymore. Such a bad product. Maybe the other veet products will be better.	&&&
Very satisfied	&&&
these are great for everything!! cleaning baby, to remove makeup, to wipe boogers, to clean a table top. "	&&&
These wipes sound like a good idea. Yeah, sound like it, but they aren't. No more effective than a paper towel on the dog's feet and useless on his coat. The packaging is terrible - I used them almost every day, but by the time I was 1/2 down in the pack, they were completely dried out.	&&&
Very smelly! Mildew smell after some time. Dreading using the rest of the package.	&&&
I have 3 babies under the age of 3, so I go through a lot of wipes. These were cheap, and they're really nice wipes. It's slightly annoying that sometimes, they rip before or after the perforation, but they smell nice without being scented - not chemically like a lot of the cheaper wipes tend to - and they get the job done efficiently! I normally use Target brand, but these Huggies wipes are much nicer, and they're so soft! Not on par with Pampers Sensitive wipes by any means, but a good middle ground and worth it when they're cheap!	&&&
OK	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I use these everyday for a quick clean. I know when I clean with these they clean and disinfect all in one. I definitely recommend these to people who have kids and also people who like to clean in a hurry. You can go wrong with a towel that already have disinfecting in them.	&&&
"I purchased these cases so I could put one in my and my husband's diaper bags. These have performed excellently since we first got them. I do tend to stuff them a lot fuller than they recommend, but because the case expands a bit, it can accommodate a large handful of wipes easily. We have never encountered an instance of running out of wipes, even when we're out for an entire day and had a couple of poopy diapers. The slim case means it doesn't take up much space in the bag which is always a plus. The wipes stay super moist even after being in the bag for a week. They aren't completely air tight because I am still able to squish out the excess air once I refill it, but it doesn't seem to dry out the wipes regardless. They aren't the easiest cases to open though. The zipper hasn't messed up or anything, but it does require two hands to open or some nifty finger work if you forgot to open them beforehand. They are a great purchase and I am thinking of making this a part of my ""essentials"" baskets for new parents.

Pros:
- Wipes stay moist, even after several days.
- A lot of wipes can fit in a case, much more than the packaging states.
- Slim shape doesn't take up unnecessary space in a diaper bag.
- Zipper construction is sturdy.
- Excess air can be removed from case after refilling.
- Center opening allows for wipes to be pulled one at a time.
- Sturdy case material. I haven't experienced any tearing even after 4 months of use.

Cons:
- Not easy to open single handedly. Just remember to set it up before changing your baby.
- The case is very simple. It would look really cute if it came with design options. Not really a con, but just a personal preference."	&&&
These wipes worked great on my 3 week old. They were gentle on his bum.	&&&
Exactly as described and expected. Thanks I am excited to not have dried up wipes especially for the car anymore !!! :)	&&&
Great size. Don't stain easily. Pretty pricey for what it is. Wish they were a little more affordable.	&&&
These wipes were pretty decent, the only thing I didn't like about them is they are not quite wet enough out of the package. I just added a little water and they were fine. Not quite as soft as the name brands but they get the job done.	&&&
These are my favorite disinfecting wipes. Very happy about the great deal I got with subscribe and save.	&&&
Clorox wipes are a great way to speed up the cleaning process. They are easy to use and can be used on a variety of surfaces. I love the fresh smell left behind after using these wipes.	&&&
Works as advertised. Dries fast and does not leave streaks. Use every day and great for traveling. Always have a handful in my suitcase, in my car, at work. Also use to clean my computer (desktop, laptop, tablet) and cell phone screens.	&&&
These wipes are great, I just never imagined a few years ago that in the near future I'd be a 30 year old dad reviewing butt wipes on the internet. What inspired me to write a review instead of just continue to wipe butts is that my wife and I had a discussion about how these had a great texture, and we're slimey- really good wipes.	&&&
Keeps wipes warm, and moist. I buy my wipes at Costco, and it does not take all the wipes from a costco pack, so I just wish it were a little taller. But other than that great product.	&&&
I cannot live w/o wipes. I use both Clorax and Lysol brand. It does keep my house clean, disinfected to the best of my knowledge. The only thing i dislike is that towards the end, there is a lot of liquid left which i hate to throw away. I use regular paper napkins with that liquid to further clean for a day or two. Comes in different smells, which is great.	&&&
looks good if you are trying to disguise toddler wipes in your guest bathroom. works great like most oxo products do!	&&&
These wipes are okay. I don't usually go for these when I buy wipes, just because they smell like they've already been used.	&&&
I love \huggies wipes. The only ones I will buy.	&&&
Very good makeup removing wipes. Gets the job done and doesn't feel greasy afterwards. My daughter loves these.	&&&
"It holds wipes, big deal.

Actually, it kind of is a big deal. The design features a wipes weight that helps you pull out only one wipe at a time, without tearing. It was so nice, we bought two."	&&&
these wipes clean up any dust, dirt, etc that you might have in your home. i trust this brand to disinfect my most touched surfaces in order to clean them clean and germ-free	&&&
These wipes are the best! They're really gentle on my little guy.	&&&
In theory this sounds great...however if you have a squirmy, sick toddler, they will NOT let you repeatedly rub their noses to effectively remove the dried mucus around their faces. Honestly, I usually just wash with water (if a sink is nearby) or else dab with tissues.	&&&
These work great to clean lenses on anything!	&&&
Love to use the unscented baby wipes for my little one since he has sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone's child who has sensitive skin.	&&&
The pop-up lid stopped closing after barely 3 months of (not heavy) use. Also, the case is almost exactly the size of wipes, and so it doesn't close properly because the corners of the wipes inside keep getting stuck outside of the case.	&&&
I'm kind of surprised the ratings are so low.. This is a really good product actually! It holds lots of wipes and keep them moist for a long long time! I've been using this for over 1 month or 2 now, I never have any problem with the wipes getting dried or anything! This is thousand times better than the other products like "buti bag".. This is so easy to pull wipes out, the price is really great! I highly recommend this product!	&&&
These help keep my baby clean without causing any irritation. I've been using them for almost two years.	&&&
Easy to use plastic dispenser. Keeps wipes remain moist.	&&&
Best wipes for my sensitive child, I have used these for about 4 months now and no more booty rashes!!	&&&
My daughter was born 10 weeks early and had extremely sensitive skin. These were so gentle on her skin!	&&&
ummmmmmmmm, just like baby wipes...going to walmart/target next time don't waste your $$	&&&
the most awsome and gentle wipes for my daughter totally worth the money! i always go tot target and i buy a big box of pampers sensitive wipes it comes with 7 packs	&&&
Good quality product	&&&
I use these wipes everywhere and on everything! Keep in mind that the directions say that the area must remain visibly wet for at least 30 seconds to effectively disinfect.	&&&
I love these wipes out of all the ones we tried they are pure gentle and cleansing	&&&
"We love these wipes!

They smell great, work incredibly well, and are free of harmful chemicals. They far out perform all other wipes. The only close runner up, in my opinion, would be the honest company. They have a slightly raised texture and that's nice too. These are our first go to for wipes!

Thank you Clearly Herbal!!"	&&&
Huggies are my favorite wipes by far. I find some wipes to be so soft that I have a hard time getting my daughter clean before she's tired of laying there and starts to squirm and others are to rough and end up irritating her. Huggies has found the perfect balance when it comes to wipes!	&&&
very convenient, take in your purse, tote, diaper bag....love them and they are alcohol free...highly recommend	&&&
I didn't really like these gentle wipes. The scent as well as the wipe itself. It was a bit rough to me. I've tried other gentle wipes that have a softer feel and less fragrant. I won't be buying these again in the future.	&&&
I love these wipes! fast And easy clean up. and the scent is nice, fresh , and clean! these wipes can pretty much be used on anything.	&&&
convenient and I love the fact that they don't have a smell	&&&
These wipes are very sturdy and clean very well.	&&&
My husband uses the wipes more than I do!!! We have a toddler and we although we use this for disinfecting our toddler's toys and whatever she wants to get her hands to, but my husband uses a load of these for his personal "baby" ... his Jordan/shoe collection.	&&&
These wipes are so soft! The fabric is thicker too, which is nice considering their intended use :) Very good quality. I'm very happy with this purchase. If I need more, I wouldn't even bother looking at other products, I'd buy these again.	&&&
No problems with these wipes. They're great!	&&&
These wipes are so versatile I use them anywhere for anything. In the car, at school, in the kitchen or bathroom. So clean, so fresh.	&&&
Yep, it is a large box of wipes.	&&&
Easy & Convenient to grab. Cleans anything and leaves it spelling fresh	&&&
Wipes are nice and warm for changing baby.	&&&
Even after my kids are gone there are so many great uses for wipes.	&&&
I buy a big box of pampers wipes about every other month and they are great for my daughter. Buying wipes is so important for me because my baby gets use to get diaper rashes all the time and I needed a wipe that were gentle for her butt :) I keep on buying these kind of wipes	&&&
I love these wipes. I use them for everything. I keep a stock of these everywhere I go.	&&&
I've been using these wipes for years now and the wipes I just received are not the same. They are thinner and drier then usual. I put my finger through one. Had I not opened the packages and put in wipes containers before testing I would return them	&&&
Easy way to clean stainless steel appliances in a hurry	&&&
I really don't like these wipes! Half the time they don't get my makeup off at all, the other half of the time it ends up putting small flecks of it back on my face. Also leaves the corners of my eyes feeling very irritated.	&&&
I have eliminated all disinfectant sprays, rags, and sponges and use Clorox wipes instead. I love the smell and the fact that it kills all germs especially in the bathroom and kitchen!	&&&
"These are the best baby wipes out there, whether your baby is big or small! They are perfect for those with perfume sensitivity, and are large, soft, and moist. The only thing that would make them more perfect is that they could be flushable, but since as a rule, baby wipes are not flushable, I view this as a nice-to-have, and not a reason to put fewer stars in my rating. These do not come with the tub. You will have to use a tub you have on hand or go out and purchase one package of the wipes in a tub, so you have a tub to use, if you need one.

Nothing locally can beat Amazon's current price for these wipes. It is fantastic. Not the grocery, drugstore, or even the discount department stores. (The big box stores may have a comparable price, but I do not shop there, so I cannot include them here.) Having these delivered to your front door is super convenient. I am one happy customer."	&&&
These are really thin. I always need two.	&&&
I keep Clorox wipes in my desk at work. I have people coming in and out of my office all day and these wipes not only help keep my office looking clean but during flu/cold season help prevent spread of pesky germs!	&&&
I have 9 cats and thought this would be a good solution for trying to keep their teeth clean, and it seemed easier than trying to brush their teeth. They all hate the mint flavor. I don't know why manufacturer used mint - not something cats naturally like. I have a terrible time trying to wipe their teeth and gums. Maybe if the wipes had no flavor or scent it would be easier to use on cats. I have basically given up. Not worth the struggle! I would not recommend this product for cleaning cats' teeth.	&&&
keep up the good work	&&&
I love these wipes! They are great for my kids with sensitive skin. We also find them to feel less slimy of a texture compared to other brands.	&&&
These are great and do not streak at all	&&&
In my opinion these wipes weren't quite wet enough to clean up all the really large messes. They were ok and I would be tempted to buy them again to see if I just got a bad batch.	&&&
Only wipes I use for my TV	&&&
Love Love Love these disinfecting wipes. I use them for everything. We have a little toy pom and she likes to tinkle when she gets excited so I constantly have to disinfect the areas that she has an accident. We have disinfecting wipes in almost every room downstairs and not only does it disinfect but it deodorizes too!	&&&
These are less quality that I've used in the past. This material that tends to stick together badly when wet and fall apart after a few minutes.	&&&
Specific beauty eye makeup remover wipes serve a dual purpose. One side has tiny bumps and is used to exfoliate and the other side is a facial cleanser. I am a contact lens wearer so when offered a promotion to try these wipes in exchange for my honest opinion, I was thrilled. When removing my eye makeup, the cloth was so soft and gentle and didn't cause any eye irritation, a problem I've had in the past. The exfoliating side helped remove all traces of makeup, yet didn't irritate my skin. These wipes are alcohol and oil free, a must for my acne prone skin. My face felt clean, soft and smooth after using. Will be purchasing more in the future.	&&&
These wipes are great and you get a plastic storage box. However, I thought they were divided differently so they didn't fit where we store the wipes at our house. The plastic box doesn't fit either so we will be going back to a different brand.	&&&
I like these. Didn't think they were thin or cheap at all. Pretty much the same as the store brand I always use. I'll be keeping my amazon subscription for these.	&&&
These wipes are great! I have very sensitive skin and almost all of the wipes I have used (even the ones that saw sensitive skin) burn my skin and make my cheeks super red. I haven't had any trouble with these wipes at all and they get my makeup off easily without having to rub hard.	&&&
"me & my wife
just had a newborn
so these come
in hand at the
store you will
spend $1.00-$5.99
for one pack
these are great
i been buy these
for 6 months"	&&&
the scrubbing pad that these have on them work well when you have something that needs just a little extra attention	&&&
My favorite brand name wipes!	&&&
As a former loyal Huggies Wipes user I have to say that I am surprised at how much I love these wipes. They get the job done with less wipes and are super soft! Huggies One and Done wipes do smell better; however, these do not smell bad. I am very impressed overall and have made the switch!	&&&
Wife found out about these on her trip to Europe and loved them ever since	&&&
"Excellent for Household used. Smell &
Fresh , used by many Hospital , instant
Germs cleaner ! Used also for Stain Remover. Not for Human ! Will buy again:)"	&&&
I LOVE the tub these come in!!	&&&
"Pro: I love that these wipes are natural, and they work great. I feel okay using them not just for diaper wipes, but also on my baby's face because they are so natural.
Con: The dispensing system--or lack thereof. These do NOT work like a tissue box in that dispensing one wipe causes the next one to be pulled up through the dispensing hole. Instead, I find that I have to dig for each individual wipe. If I'm lucky, I pull up only one, but sometimes I get a clump and then have to separate them.

I like the wipes but will not be buying them again as dispensing them is just too much of a pain."	&&&
Great for removing those crusty patches!	&&&
Good value for the product. Easy to apply, removes grease and finger prints and leaves a good shine.	&&&
I am a HUGE fan of pampers but the scented wipes are one of the only things I don't like. My Little one has a sensitive but and the aren't good for him. Try a little pack before you buy the big one!	&&&
We use this for our baby and we love it. When I purchased this box of wipes I compared the price to our local and internet stores and you couldn't beat the price. So here we are buying it from Amazon!	&&&
This is a giant package of wipes. There are three big re-sealable plastic bags in the box with a little over 200 wipes in each one. We put a bag in each bathroom and the kitchen and refill the wipe holders as needed. These are pretty strong and surprisingly durable, I use them to wipe down the sink & even a quick swipe of the tile floors when the dogs come in with muddy paws. Heck, I have even used these to wipe off some dog paws. (There are times when you don't want a Clorox wipe)	&&&
Great price	&&&
I am not using this product for baby wipes. I am using it to clean the tables and when traveling by car, I can use it to wash my hands when needed. This product is useful in several ways. Thank you for the amazing product.	&&&
Great, sturdy wipes. Clean baby's bottom without leaving a film. Package is easy to open. Dispenses wipes that sometime need to be pulled apart- stick end to end.	&&&
These wipes are amazing! Good, strong, quality. Don't have to use as many as with other brands.	&&&
Most of packs do not fit inside as it is too small. I tried to use a couple of times, but I did not like it.	&&&
I like the wipes for their convenience when I have a small spill in the kitchen or have guests coming over and need to clean the bathroom sink.	&&&
Best wipes! The right amount of moisture, soft and flexible! I can get much more clean with fewer wipes when I use these!	&&&
Works great to freshen up on the go!	&&&
Works great! Does not irritate. I've tried several kinds but I always go back to this one. Surely this is a keeper!	&&&
I really like these wipes. I got them because of the recent discount on them and figured it was worth the try. They have a fresh, cucumber scent and are soft to the touch. The feel is similar to Pampers wipes but they're not slippery to me like the Pampers wipes are. I typically use Huggies wipes and will probably stick with them only because of their points and rewards program but these Amazon wipes are my #2 choice.	&&&
These are great wipes when your baby is young, in bewteen baths, etc. Not only are they great for cleaning very well during diaper changes, but they also keep the baby's skin clean and moisturized when you both aren't feeling that evening bath once in awhile.	&&&
Great item, not overly scented like other wipes. I use them at school, they work just fine.	&&&
I used this on my two dogs, miniature dachshunds who are notorious for bad teeth. You will need two pieces per day per dog. I was surprised, but both of my dogs don't hate it. One actually seems to enjoy it. It is a good product, removes a lot of build up, In my experience, a lot better than foams and water additives.	&&&
I love these wipes. I use them for everything. After one of my kids is sick I clean every doorknob ans tv remote in the house.	&&&
I just bought these for the first time, I love that you can buy in bulk and get 6pks in a box as much as we go through wipes that really helps a large family like ours. These are very soft and durable and clean very well, the only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because it says unscented but they do have a scent to them, not sure if it is the aloe in them or what it is but they do have some sort of smell too them, its not too bad but it is there, so be prepared for a slight scent to them.	&&&
I decided to buy two of these because they're now only available at the vision center at my local Wal-Mart, which is well known for the mean women who work there and the wipes sold where these USED to be sold in electronics are a poor substitute. Anyway, I bought two boxes, which should last me about a century, provided I live that long and my eyesight doesn't correct itself magically or anything. If neither happens, I'll probably buy the box of six hundo. I guess what I'm saying is going ahead and buy them. They do what they're advertised to do.	&&&
My daughter is prone to diaper rash. These wipes helped keep her skin stay nice, soft and rash free. When I switch to the cheaper wipes I noticed she broke out in a rash easier plus they smell wonderful. When I used them I really felt like my baby had a nice clean bottom.	&&&
I love these wipes! From the fresh clean scent it has to the strength it has when wiping. I've used other wipe brands but none compare to these! I love using these on my little girl knowing they're sensitive on her skin while getting the job done !	&&&
I use this all the time I have ISB and need them! Wish you guys would make them just a bit bigger.	&&&
I use these facial wipes every evening before I moisturize and I just love them. My skin is somewhat sensitive, but I have never had any issues with redness due to these products, and they are fairly soft. They do not leave my skin feeling dry, but they also don't leave an oily residue on my skin. The wipes are big enough to wipe down your whole face and neck. They do okay with waterproof mascara and other eye makeup, but tend to leave a bit of smudginess behind when used to remove eyeliner or mascara. That's fine if you're just taking makeup off before bed, but if you want your eyes totally free of makeup you may need to follow up with some eye makeup remover. Other than that, no complaints!	&&&
great price !	&&&
Best wipes ever. My son is 2 months old so we are still using products from his baby shower. With the different assortment of products we got Huggies ismy all time favorite.	&&&
My kids are always making messes and this is so easy for them to use. I love that they can be responsible for their own messes.	&&&
i love to clean everything with these from my counter tops to my kitchen table even my stove top they make everything feel clean and good as new!	&&&
My son is allergic to all other wipes. These wipe are great for his skin while still strong enough to get him clean. These are the only wipes i will stick with	&&&
I love pampers sensitive wet wipes, they work perfectly on my baby girl skin, my only concern that if they can be extra soft because my baby skin really very sensitive and can be scratch easily.	&&&
Another excellent product from Korres. The texture of the wipes help to remove make-up perfectly. The smell is delicious.	&&&
I prefer these wipes over any other. My children are really sensitive to most wipes, but I've never had any problems with these. These also stay pretty moist! Other wipes tend to lose moisture, these keep their moisture. We always go with these!	&&&
only wipes that go on my little ones hiney! super moist and can normally do the job with just one wipe! only wipes i recomend"	&&&
We loved the diapers so we had high expectations for these wipes. They're almost too soft to wipe and we found you need more than other thicker brands. We won't be buying this again. "	&&&
The Clorox Fresh Scent wipes are my favorite. They smell great and do a great job cleaning. We raise dogs and this is a great way to clean up their messes. Also have the wipes stashed in every bathroom. They make cleaning my bathroom quick, easy and clean	&&&
These wipes are mild and soft. I only took off 1 star because they kind of stick to my baby's bottom and they don't always break at the perforated line.	&&&
Pretty decent size for mid-sized SUV hump. Not a fan of the bright orange striped piping, so I darkened it with a black magic marker. Would like the sides to be a little more rigid, as they tend to fold inward over time. Could use more hook & loop on the bottom. The small amount that's there isn't enough to hold very well on my carpet.	&&&
These natural organic wipes are perfect for so many things. I bought them because I was looking for a chemical-free wipe for removing makeup, etc. They are absolutely perfect. 5 Stars!	&&&
Love the lemon and lime scent. This Item works well, and use this item almost daily to wipe down and sanitize as needed. I added this to my subscribe and save as I don't want to run out of them.	&&&
Unsure if these clean quite as well as the microwave bags.	&&&
Great product at a great price Thanks wal-mart.com	&&&
I have no problem with diaper rash and been using this since day 1 of my baby.	&&&
Part of my morning routine is to use these wipes to clean down my glasses. They are also quite handy at cleaning PC screens, cell phone screens and wiping down my watch. In typical cheap fashion - I try to use the same wipe for multiple uses before they dry out. They do not have a strong odor and really brighten the lenses - getting rid of any grime or residue. I like my glasses to shine and these help to make them crystal clear for clear vision. Highly recommend and I keep ordering them - great brand and not bad for the price. Highly recommend.	&&&
I first got these wipes in 2005 when my first child was born, and i opened the bag and i fell in love with the smell... they smell so fresh and clean, like a baby!! and as time went on and i used other wipes.. i really wanted to go back to the luvs... they were hard to find, so i kept asking the person who first gave them to me "which store did you get them?!" but now i know where to find them all the time..and they are great!! no need to try another bran d..	&&&
These are so great to clean counters and tables in a jif! You don't need a million of them either. Just one has the durability and enough cleaning product to get the job done!"	&&&
The only way that your wipes will keep a little warm is by keeping the box full of wipes, if the warmer is filled of wipes until half so the wipes will feel at room temperature. And the worst part is that my hands can hardly reach the wipes when the box is until half or less because the hole is made of plastic and no rubber which makes it difficult to reach. So what I do is opening the cover, take wipes and close back and to avoid doing that I should keep the warmer full of wipes.	&&&
Huggies one and done wipes are the only way to go for any parent. We have tried many other brands, and these are the best. We do not care for Huggies diapers, but the wipes are great!	&&&
These are definitely not the quality I expect from Huggies. The simply clean wipes are small, thin and untextured, they feel cheap. I love Huggies wipes and thought these were a great deal, but they just seem like an off-brand product. I definitely won't be buying them again.	&&&
I love an affordable wipe, that works great! They are great for cleaning up baby sized messes!	&&&
I bought these to use as makeup remover wipes, as the sales lady at Nordies said that's what she and a bunch of her friends use. It works and isn't irritating. I'll definitely be using them for my daughter once she is born this winter.	&&&
I keep these in my bathroom, kitchen, office, and car! I love these wipes and the scent isn't overpowering!	&&&
I use these everyday. These are the best at getting off stubborn mascara. These wipes don't cause my very oily skin to break out. I highly recommend them.	&&&
I'm always on the go and my bag is full. Inevitably, my hair, or my fingers, end up on my glasses and they are smudged! I've used other wipes but thought I would try these. They work very well. There are 3 boxes plus 20 are in a small zipper bag, small and convenient. I'll purchase more when I'm down to one box.	&&&
My little guy has super sensitive skin and he never reacted to these wipes! The only thing I don't like about these wipes is that they are kind of slimy? Not sure how to describe it but if you wipe your hands off with it they feel slimy or greasy after and I jus did not like that so we have moved on....great price if you can get over the greasy feeling	&&&
Best makeup remover wipes i have ever had! I'm never buying any other brand. It completely takes your makeup off."}	&&&
The first quarter of the wipes will come out in multiples or rip on you. Which is kind of annoying.	&&&
I can't really tell a difference between normal Huggies wipes, but whatever. I like Huggies wipes a lot better than Pampers.	&&&
Watch out if you order this product (Endust for Electronics LCD and Plasma Pop Up Wipes 70 CT - 11506) from seller Connect Buy. What this merchant does is place an order for you on SamsClub.com for Endust For Electronics Pop-Up, Pre-Moistened, Anti-Static & Non-Streak Wipes, 70-Count, which is what SamsClub.com sells. And that's what you get. The wipes you get are "Not for use on LCD and Plasma TVs or laptop screens."	&&&
"This product doesn't come close to doing what it said it could do. Yes, it does have 19% Aluminum Zirconium based antiperspirant, but so do the other wipes, gels (I have one with 17.5% Aluminum Zirconium based antiperspirant and it doesn't work either.) I ripped the box open with hope in my heart, applied the pleasantly scented pad to my face, and after it dried felt a pulling, drying sensation. I walked a few steps out in the yard in the shade on a day with a temperature of 80 degrees and after about 5 minutes I felt the telltale drip starting to form at my temples, cheeks and neck. I used two more on consecutive days with exactly the same results. I do have hyperhydrosis and my problem is fairly severe, but I thought this product was formulated to handle sweat.

I am glad this stuff works for some people, but at $48.00 for 30 towelettes my suggestion would be to skip this stuff."	&&&
Clorox wet wipes are a great solution to busy moms trying to clean up after their kids non-stop. It smells great, removes surface dirt and is very conveniently packaged in a dispenser. Love it!	&&&
Keeps my studio germ free!	&&&
A must have for any family.	&&&
Great wipes! They clean my baby very well. She has had no rash or irritation with this product. I even use them around the house and to remove make up on myself!	&&&
Perhaps a bit small but the price offsets that. I have them in my car, my desk my suitcase. If you are looking for sanitizing wipes, this fills the bill.	&&&
this is great .. I use them as well .. they are soft and have saline... not too pricey either	&&&
The only good thing about these wipes is that they don't "lint" like Pamper's Sensitive Wipes. Now, what's wrong with these wipes? They tear easily - every other one we pull out of the wipes holder rips - either a small strip, or in half, or it doesn't and then pulls half of the next one out. Completely inconsistent. Smell is good - most wipes are. Did not irritate our daughter's skin.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes, they are so convenient to use. I keep a container in my kitchen and bathroom at all times.	&&&
Im using them every ride. They do a great job and easily clean two bikes.	&&&
Excellent wipes! These cleans really well from microwave, counter top to bathroom seats and much much more!	&&&
I always keep baby wipes handy ..you never know when you're going to need to use them! Not just for baby bums!	&&&
Unfortunately, the wipes dried out before we got halfway through the can. We're not novices to wipes and know how to close the can properly, so I don't believe that to be the problem. But within 2 months of opening, all the balance are useless. Disappointing product.	&&&
These are the softest wipes out there and they are the only ones that do not irritate my sons skin.	&&&
I love these wipes! I normally use Target brand, but have tried Pampers and Huggies as well, and these are by far my favorite. I would way they are thicker than Target brand, but don't rip easily like Huggies do.I plan on purchasing these from now on.	&&&
Good as a makeup remover but I still like to use regular eye makeup remover with a q-tip, remove residue/remaining makeup with these wipes, and then wash my face.	&&&
I LOVE these wipes! I normally only buy Huggies but I actually like these better. These seem softer and more durable!	&&&
Awesome product. Great value ... easy enough to put in each room of the house	&&&
I thought the store would be cheaper for these. But for some reason the stores dont even carry these sizes. Theyre huge!	&&&
I buy these wipes weekly and use them daily! Love them! They also smell great unlike some disinfectant wipes!	&&&
I have a skin disorder so the Huggies Natural Care wipes are the best! I have them on a Subscribe&Save from Amazon as I hate being without!	&&&
These wipes are amazing you can clean everything from the bathtub to the kitchen counter to your kids toys with them.	&&&
My wife calls me baby, but that's not why I need these. Whether you're bedridden or not you need personal hygiene, and I've found these work better and less expensive than other forms. Going through Amazon cuts the cost. The Huggies are the right size, thickness, softness and cleaning ability. If you need a Bottom Buddy they fit and hold well. The " bottom" line, these work.	&&&
The thicker the wipe, the better! I hate wipes that just dissolve in your hand. Don't necessarily care for the smell though	&&&
These are the only baby wipes I use for my kids. They aren't much more than Pampers wipes cost wise, and they're worth every penny! They're nice and thick and unless my daughter has a huge blowout, one or two per change is more than enough. They're also good for cleaning messy hands and faces!	&&&
Well worth giving this one a try. I have very dark espresso and cappuccino furniture which requires constant dusting for fingerprints. This product works! Tried a few of the other name brands, and Weiman Wipes do it better!! Inexpensive enough to give them a chance, to see if they will work for your dusting needs also;	&&&
"How you use the product and it us great and solves the problem"	&&&
I keep going back to this product! I have normal/slightly dry skin. It smells fresh and really makes my face feel clean. These wipes gently and effectively remove makeup.	&&&
Love the wash cloths, however the box was torn. Because it was a gift, I had to find a different box to give as a gift. :(	&&&
These wipes are great! Thick which is great so nothing gets on mommy & soft so baby is comfortable ?	&&&
these are outstanding to clean fast and effectively	&&&
This product is excellent for removing waterproof makeup doesn't make your eyes filmy after using either!	&&&
I love these wipes! They are so useful when cleaning up any mess! They smell great and are easy to store and use.	&&&
These are good wipes. I wish they had a dispenser because sometimes the wipes get stuck together which is a drag.	&&&
Germ-X Antibacterial Soft Wipes Singles are the best product of their type that I have ever used. They are larger and softer than the competition (Purell and many others) and are well sealed in a foil/plastic envelope. They smell good and are free of unnecessary ingredients, thus they don't make your hands feel soapy. The price at Sam's Club is very good, though the shipping cost makes it less of a bargain; next time, I'll pick them up at my local Sam's Club store.	&&&
I use these quite often, but I always wear gloves because they leave my hands smelling like the cleaner if I don't, even after washing my hands a few times. These wipes work really well on my counters and stove!	&&&
This does remove makeup well,but I am in my early 40's and it seems a bit harsh espically the smell. I don't love it but it does the job.	&&&
I love it.Very easy to use and clean.No hassle especilly whe you cleaning kitchen and bathrooms	&&&
Clorox wipes have nothing on Lysol wipes! It doesn't leave my counter as nice and clean as the Lysol brand and it usually costs a bit more.	&&&
I adore Josie Maran products and wanted to love these just as much as I love her argan oil, nail wipes and body butter. However, they sting my face - unlike anything else in her line that I’ve tried. Granted, I have sensitive skin, but it is not to the point where I cannot use most products. I do appreciate that these are paraben and sulfate free, and that a portion of the proceeds helps to protect polar bears. Overall, I will not repurchase due to the stinging but think this is not an issue that would bother everyone (those with less sensitive skin).	&&&
I use these for the whole family, from 4 to 40 year olds. They are strong, good for sensitive skin. The package holds up well and doesn't result in dried out wipes. The only downside is that they are pretty expensive.	&&&
It works.Good!!	&&&
I'm not sure if its just me but the main reason I adore huggies wipes is because I find most other brands of wipes to be extremely wet. Huggies I always feel like its damp enough to clean everything up and not leave a puddle behind.	&&&
Thanks for the convenience Clorox!! These are kept out in the open and are taken on the go too!	&&&
Love huggies baby wipes!! Good quality wipes. Used them with both my kids. Soft and gentle for baby	&&&
What can I say? They wipe of poo like nobody's business.	&&&
these work so well. my face feels so clean after using	&&&
Very convenient product for those quick cleanups. Wipes are reusable.	&&&
I've always liked Huggies wipes. They are thicker and hold up better than other brands.	&&&
These wipes are great! They are just as good as the name brand wipes and cost less. They are gentle on baby's skin as well.	&&&
Baby in hand, I can still use it to clean up my babies high-chair. I recommend this product for anyone who wants an easy to wipe up a mess one handed.	&&&
These wipes are the best. I use them everywhere around the house; from the bathroom to the top of a greasy stove. These are the best!	&&&
I LOVE HUGGIE WIPES! They are truly the best wipes to get as well as diapers. I have been using them on my son for 2 years now!	&&&
These wipes are very convenient. The packaging is perfect for traveling and taking along in my diaper bag because it is soft and not bulky. The scent is pleasant and light. The wipes are good quality and size, too!	&&&
I love this product amazing for on the road with little kids	&&&
Product is Ok but way overpriced.	&&&
At work, use for disinfecting customer pin-pads, cashier keyboard, calculator, stapler, ATM keys, around the coffee bar, in the restroom(s), counter tops.....basically everywhere the germs might pass from one person to another. At home, kitchen counters and knobs, TV remotes, home phone(s), bathrooms, door handles and wastebaskets.... even the dog leash handles!!. Seems especially bad this year for cold and flu bugs!	&&&
this i like. is good. yes. nice yes.	&&&
This is one of the best cleaning tools you'll ever use!	&&&
This was a great purchase I made that was actually helpful its not to big its just perfect when your on the go you have room to put more than a little inside.	&&&
I love these for wiping my mask... Have ordered them before, and will order them again.. I want to be sure to use wipes designed for medical equipment...	&&&
I was so lucky to receive a free sample of these wipes to try (I have a son on the way, and am trying to find a good brand to stick with that is gentle). Because I have very bad eczema on my hands, I always have to test any baby product I buy on myself first. These wipes were gentle and didn't make my skin burn or itch at all. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the ingredients list as I am trying to get rid of chemicals in my household.I only wish these wipes did not leave so much lint. It is a mess after a use to try to get the lint off.	&&&
Didn't like these wipes at all for body use; feels like a lot of alcohol in the product, and the wipes aren't loaded with much product at all. It took one whole wipe just to sufficiently moisturize one arm. Won't buy again as a replacement for body lotion in a travel bag. Definitely for hands only.	&&&
Better than using other wipes chalk full of chemicals but I hate the residue and the foaming that it has.	&&&
"I really like this product because it is designed with women in mind. The clothes were very soothing, soft, and left me feeling comfortable. I was not a fan of how the original Prep H wipes smelled, so this was a welcome change. I like how there is chamomile, cucumber, and aloe to help sooth my sores. This product is worth a try for sure!
“I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”"	&&&
These medicated wipes are great for on the go. They do provide relief from inflammation and discomfort and I also felt that they helped them go away faster. Though there will never be a product available that can make hemorrhoids go away fast enough, these wipes do help a lot! I also like the fact that they are in convenient individual packs to store for use on the go. I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
Cleaning wipes were perfect for my brand new leather. My car has black leather interior and I was damaged by my niece with Hershey's chocolate and foot prints. After a few swipes it looked brand new!!	&&&
First box exceptional value- subsequent terrible value, we canceled subscription. Great quality, terrible -no value whatsoever, became fiercely overpriced after 1st shipment.	&&&
I love these wipes! They seems to be gentle on baby's bottom but have enough grip to get the job done. Always have baby wipes on hand for whatever job come up.	&&&
Huggies wipes are the ONLY wipes i will buy. They are very strong, durable, and great for sensitive skin also..	&&&
"Ahhh...this product helps me be lazier in the upkeep of my CPAP machine. Sometimes I would forget to wash the nose cushion, and have to wash it at night. That led to a wet nose for the night.

With these wipes, I can wipe and the nose cushion will be dry within the hour.

Others were mentioning a smell, but I got the unscented kind. I don't smell anything bad."	&&&
I wish the wipes had more textures for more effective cleaning.	&&&
With 3 kids and a dog every surface gets grimy and sticky, these Clorox Wipes are a necessity for a quick cleanup.	&&&
These are so great to use in the kitchen to wipe down everything! Cuts through my tough kitchen grease and smells very pleasant! Also good to use on the counter tops to ensure everything is disinfected.	&&&
I LOVE Clorox Wipes, I keep them in every room! I keep the travel size in my purse, sometime while out to eat the table just isn't "clean enough". I even send a container in monthly to my kids' teacher's...I believe Clorox Wipes have helped keep our home "FLU FREE" this year!!? Yes, you can save a few cents buy purchasing "store brands" but they are much thinner and dry our much faster.	&&&
Cold season has met its match. I feel so much better having these around. I can easily disinfect high traffic areas and my kids' toys.	&&&
It makes my skin feel so good and soft. It cleans really good.	&&&
I use these all of the time and they're great. My biggest complaint, hence the three stars, is that they're just too big. They are probably even too big for me! Would be more practical and less wasteful if the came in a smaller size.	&&&
My daughter and I are never apart from these wipes. Unlike other wipes these don't smell metallic and are very gentle. They don't tear and are fab for toilet training, sticky faces and dirty clothes. Always a good choice	&&&
I am very careful with germs and bacteria. I keep these wipes in my purse and car. We use these wipes everytime we leave a store. And of course we wipe down shopping carts. I wipe down doorknobs and remotes while staying in motels. I find them very useful wiping down airplane arn rests and the seat pockets. We rarely get sick and I am sure part is do to Purell. I'm grateful for how convienent these are to keep on hand.	&&&
My absolute favorite wipe brand of all time its soft and durable I've used wipes that tear apart not this one.. I love the scent and price is good too... Diffentley recommend to every mom	&&&
I prefer huggies wipes over every other brand of wipes! They're thicker and seem more sturdy than other brands!	&&&
These are the best wipes! My daughter has very sensitive skin and has a lot of issues with the wipes that contain even a little alcohol. So these are perfect for her. They're soft on skin and have a nice sent.	&&&
Our daughter is addicted to these. We may need to stage an intervention. She started using them when she was about 9 months old and a year later demands 10 a day....at least (in addition to brushing her teeth).	&&&
Awesome product for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. A product you can trust!	&&&
Only wipes I buy for my son. I love the one and done wipes but these are cheaper and work just as good.	&&&
I've never been a real fan of any Pamper's wipes, so these are no different. Too thin and take too many wipes to get the job done.	&&&
Great wipes for last minute clean-ups. A fresh scent leaving cats smelling clean. A good wipe-down cleaning wipe to reduce dander, especially right after a good brushing or combing. We use these on our 8 cats quite regularly. They don't enjoy a real bath, but don't seem to mind the wipes. A handy item to have on hand. I will keep these handy to simplify times of minor clean-up of our cats.	&&&
"I use one bit per 4 cups of reverse osmosis purified water. I didn't want anything very soapy because I was afraid it would dry out my baby's skin. It seems to be a nice balance for us - we would use plain water, but I like the nice aroma. I love that I can make my solution exactly as potent as I want because they are giving me the soap bits, not a premade solution.
We have been using it for several weeks now and in the distant future when I run out, I plan to buy more. Using purified water, I have not had any problems with strange scents or growths in my modified (caulked) wipes warmer."	&&&
These wipes are awesome! They are thick and last forever! I rarely find myself buying wipes because each time I change my sons diaper I only have to use one.	&&&
I pay more for these wipes because they do not leave lint on your hands like some of the other wipes do.	&&&
Love these wipes! Best part, comes in an individual package. Never worry about refilling a container. Only wipes I used with my daughter & will use for my son if I ever have to buy them.	&&&
we have these in the kitchen and both bathrooms the kids use them even my husband uses them they are amazing and work well. thanks for such a great product	&&&
I swear by huggie wipes when it says one and done it means one and done. No need to use multiple wipes they don't rip or tear mid wipe. The fragrance isn't too strong and my little guy has very sensitive skin and never broke out from huggies.	&&&
We switched to Pamers after trying another brand of sensitive wipes that did not help prevent my son's butt rash. So far, he has had no issues and we are happy with these wipes.	&&&
I really wanted to love this, but sadly could not. It didn't remove my make-up at all. It is super moisturizing and does feel amazing on my skin. I stopped using it at night and finished the pack by using it in the morning after I woke. In that way it did moisturize my skin. I will not purchase this again.	&&&
Oh how I love Clorox disinfectant wipes. I have one for every room. They are so easy and convenient to use when you don't have paper towels and a spray to clean your counters and bathrooms. Clorox wipes don't leave a streak when used on glass which I like. Also love them since I have a 3 year old who loves to make a mess everywhere.	&&&
Great to have on the go - the wipes are very gentle and can also be used for pacifiers, toys, etc.	&&&
These wipes are my hands down favorites. They're strong, and they're incredibly gentle on my baby's little bum. One wipe will usually get the job done, so I save a ton of money because I don't have to constantly buy more. They're also good for cleaning little faces on the go.	&&&
I love clorox wipes, I run a daycare out of mine so we definitely use plenty of wipes. I was purchasing them at the store but tend to run out before my next trip so I decided to order them. The Shipping time was good and the price was too. However, the box was upside down inside another box as I ordered a few other things. The wipes leaked and wound up getting everything else in my order wet. I would advise if you order them you have them shipped separately from other items!	&&&
These wipes are too thin. They also dry out too fast. When I place them in a wipe warmer they dry out even faster. That's a big problem for me.	&&&
This is a great idea for kids learning to potty train. They are able to clean themselves independently. They say the wipes dissolve and are sewer friendly. This is not the case and will clog your pipes over time. These wipes lead to costly maintenance/repairs. If you use them throw them in the trash and do not flush!	&&&
I love this thing. It works great with the Medline dry wipes to make your own baby wipes (I use the 7"x13" size that comes in the 1200 pack).	&&&
Best wipes we have used. The store brand seems to be foamy and leave residue- NEVER an issue with the Clorox brand. I keep one canister in each car, the kitchen, bathroom, and the laundry room.	&&&
These are great!	&&&
These wipes are fantastic for sanitizing surfaces when I am on the go because they are easy to carry in pocket or purse. Particularly at school where I use them to wipe down the keyboard, mouse and desk surfaces that have been used previously, all day, by who knows who, with who knows what disease.	&&&
We have been using these for 20 months now. They are super soft and strong. We have tried other wipes to save money but we are always disappointed. These wipes are pure and simple too!	&&&
I ordered the Blephadex eyelid wipes and I found them to be very soothing and better than the Cliradex I have used in the past. The relief for my itchy eyes was instant and I had no sensitivity to them. I highly recommend them for itchy allergy eye relief!	&&&
These are perfect in between baths for my pugs sensitive skin. I used these to clean his wrinkles.	&&&
"great for easy clean up !"	&&&
"""Keeps wipes warm.

takes a long time to warm up cold wipes, but that's easy to fix, I just put cold wipes in a microwave safe bag and put it in for 20 secs then put the wipes in warmer"""	&&&
I have had a difficult time finding these wipes in this size. Usually most stores only carry the 6 packs and this size pack is more useful and less expensive per sheet. It is the best made type of wipes I have found for washing dishes and I much prefer these over sponges for most light cleaning tasks.	&&&
everything I expect from a wipe plus they are thicker so you require less wipes per change.	&&&
blue line bag of seventh gen wipes is much much better	&&&
I really wanted to like these diaper wipes, because the price is right, but they do not work for us because they are way too dry to clean effectively.	&&&
Recently, I have been repairing and grouting the bathroom tiles in my 2 baths. Removing the adhesive and grout from my hands was really a problem. Not anymore!!! After using HARCO Wipes, the cleanup is a piece of cake. This product is truly AMAZING!!!!	&&&
I loveee these wipes and when I have them I use them for everything. I use them to clean up spills, for the bathroom, pretty much anything I can think of. They usually don't last me very long though because I use them for so much LOL.	&&&
Very acceptable product for being a store brand. This is the only wipes that I buy. Their quality is great, price is great and they get the job done!	&&&
wonderful wipes for the prices strong and soft these will not break either they get what needs to be done done	&&&
I received a FREE sample of this from Smiley 360.com. I can not believe how amazing this is. The cool cloths really help my hemorrhoids at least 75%. I have also had the opportuniy to pass a few of the samples out to my co-workers who were also greatful to have a product that is not too harsh. The price is also wonderful compared to othewr products out in the market for hemorrhoid relief. Having trying this, it has confirmed that I will be using this product in the future!	&&&
Received this product from a baby shower. After one week, plug would no longer fit in unit. Contacted manufacturer and they sent me replacement. Replacement product worked for two days then stopped warming the wipes even though plug worked and warmer was lit. Wipes were cold! Been trying to contact manufacturer for months. Left messages, no returned calls. I am now purchasing warmer from another company. Terrible manufacturing and customer service.	&&&
THese are affordable wipes to use on everthng related to your child! They are thin but it still gets the job done. I do like the unscented because IMO the scented ones are a bit much in smell for my nose - nothing wrong with it but just a personal preference. I normally can get an entire bag for no more than $12 at local Walmart. they are my go too	&&&
These wipes have a nice fragrance and I place them in different rooms of my home. They come in handy when the phone rings while I am eating, I reach for a wipe next to the phone without worrying about my phone having food on it. The only downside is that more than one wipe comes out at a time.	&&&
Best cloth wipes ever! Great value and the serged ends prevent threads from fraying! These wipes are thick, large and really do the job when it comes to wiping up diaper messes. Even with diaper blow-outs, I could often get by with using just one of these wipes! I would suggest combining this with a wipes warmer like the Prince Lionheart Warmies Wipes Warmer.	&&&
I love this wipe. The clutch makes my life so much easier,the soft case makes it easy to put in my purse and smoosh the zipper shut ;) Also I really enjoy the look of the clutch, If I know I am just running in to the store for a item or two I can put a diaper in a ziplock bag and put it in the clutch and have my wipes with me too!	&&&
Best wipes. So soft and sturdy and does not rip like some other brands.	&&&
These wipes are super good!! Large in size and durable. I save hundreds of dollars a year using these versus what the long term care facility would normally charge my Mother. Great product.	&&&
the softness is just right for newborns, the scent isn't strong either.	&&&
The wipes were not as "Simple" as I've had with other wipes. I had to rub my skin with the wipes several times, which was irritating and the quality of the wipes were not what I expected. I will say overall my face felt clean after removing my make up.	&&&
These wipes ripped whenever I took them out of the package. They are so thin it took twice as many wipes to clean my baby's poopy diaper. I definitely don't recommend. I bought these because they were on sale but have since went back to using Seventh Generation wipes.	&&&
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I tried this product and I love it. I like that it comes in discrete individual wrappers so that I can carry them with me. I am able to leave the house and know that I can take care of my discomfort discretely.	&&&
We received a free sample to try & now, we're hooked. :-) We will never use another brand of wipes again, the wipes on gentle yet very durable.	&&&
Good thick wipes, came exactly as expected, after re ordering them from a different website	&&&
These wipes are great they're not full of extra crap that your baby doesn't need, I even use them to wipe down the interior of my car to clean it and my hands and everything else because I don't have to worry about all the extra stuff that are in most other wipes. They even clean dirty hands after working in the yard .	&&&
"I live in a house with four ""dudes""....my husband, two teenage boys and an almost teen in a few months. I'll admit that I never gave up the wet wipes even after the boys grew out of them. They were just too convenient for wiping up messes in the car, sticky hands, and so on. But when I have four dudes, two of which are bigger than me, I think we've grown out of the baby wipe container. We needed something that was a little more discrete and didn't scream ""BABY!"". We don't use the dude wipes in our bathroom as our city sewer system doesn't take kindly to wipes being flushed down toilets. However, for testing purposes while out at a store, I did flush one down the toilet to see if it would actually flush and it went down without any issues. We use them as we have always used them which is for sticky hands, freshening up when out and about, etc. They will be nice when we go hiking or camping as well. I do like that they don't have any fragrance....which will be good outdoors so as to not attract insects, but it was also nice because I easily get headaches from strong scents.

We did encounter the same issue that many other reviewers also had and that is that when pulling the wipes out of the container, it was often difficult (especially at first) and several would come out at one time and there would be a hole in them. I could definitely see how this would be an issue if these were being used for the intended purpose of the bathroom. However, since we use them outside of the bathroom, it wasn't that big of a deal for us. It is something that I would suggest needs improvement though. The price also seems high for 48 wet wipes.

Disclosure: I received this product for little or no cost in exchange for testing and an honest review. I am in no way required or influenced by the seller to leave a positive response. I stand by my review and do not give discounted products great reviews if I would not personally recommend them. I count on honest reviews as much as you do when making purchases."	&&&
I really love these gentle, yet effective, wipes. I have sensitive skin & these wipes cleanse thoroughly without stripping my skin or being too harsh. The only downside is a full face of makeup requires 2 wipes minimum to get the job done.	&&&
I found these wipes to be very soothing for my hemorrhoids. The sheets are quite large and a great value for the price. Just wipe and flush. I received this product free for the purpose of this review. The opinion is 100% my own.	&&&
"We bought a pack of Lysol wipes in a fit of desperation during our child's first stomach bug episode, and they have become our go-to cleaning tool. Anytime illness strikes, be it vomit, be it pink eye, be it a cold, we rapid-fire wipe down all door knobs, light switches, and stair railings to minimize the spread.

We use these for many basic cleaning jobs. Bathroom, kitchen, heck I've scrubbed floors with these. They take sticky fingerprints off walls. The textured side helps clean off any manner of residues left by your child or pet."	&&&
I was very satisfied with how great this product works. I am thankful that Smiley360 allowed me to sample this product before I decided to purchase it. I would recommend this product to all women to get hemorrhoids.	&&&
These have a very strong smell and the size of the wipes are very small.	&&&
These wipes are thick and sturdy. So far I have yet to encounter a mess they cannot handle.	&&&
Love this product. Keeps everything fresh and clean. The only thing I dislike is the packaging. The wipes are a little difficult to get out. Seems like we could do better on that.	&&&
These are the only wipes I can use on my son. They are amazing. I guess every other wipe has something in it that my son is allergic too and within seconds of using other products his whole bottom is red! I love parents choice wipes! A lot cheaper then name brand and work just as great if not better!	&&&
I prefer having the unscented wipes. I have very sensitive skin.	&&&
It's great that it had a snap cover but if you don't use them right away they will dry out. Unlike the Dr. Brown wipes that are very moist and never try out.	&&&
of all the pampers wipes these are my favorite they smell great and clean spotlessly	&&&
The only wipes I can use on my daughter without her getting a rash! I love them!	&&&
Skip all the other brands and buy these. My favorite thing about them is how thick they are -- makes cleaning #2 much easier. 2nd, for a sensitive wipe (alcohol free), I'm glad they don't feel all greasy/lotion like other brands.	&&&
Pampers Sensitive wipes are by the far the best I have tried for my son, who has very sensitive skin... rashes and eczema until I switched him to Pampers Sensitive. I've even used these wipes on my face and I haven't broken out! They never rip, are very soft, and have a mild clean smell. I highly recommend these over all others.	&&&
Bought this as a baby shower gift (i do not have babies). The package was pretty heavy, its crazy how many wipes they fit in there. this should last my cousin and her baby a long long time. !	&&&
These wipes I have to say I really like, they are soft, they hold up well wash after wash and they aren't unreasonably priced. If you are cloth diapering I do recommend these, If your already saving money on diapers why not save money on wipes too? And one pack of these is sufficient (for boys anyway) I would buy 2 max.	&&&
I love these wipes, I only use them for all my glass's,cameras,computers,and they never scratch any of these.	&&&
I can't believe people leave good reviews for this product, it sucks. Whenever I grab a sheet it rips in my hand and I'm constantly worried that it will rip while I wipe the baby. Huggies, you should be ashamed of yourselves for making such a crappy product.	&&&
i love that the bags are re-sealable and that ensures that the wipes don't dry out. i love huggies products	&&&
Great wipes. Fragrance-free; Non-irritating; Low price. My only complaint is that as you get towards the bottom of the package, they get harder and harder to pull out one-at-a-time.	&&&
Simple and easy design. Good quality, works well, fits easily in diaper bag.	&&&
Never received The Hard Floor wipes, the machine overall is pretty good, I inquired about a grout brush after purchasing this unit and the one they offer is a soft as the bristles on this machine.	&&&
Clean wipes with no silly scents	&&&
We always have Clorox wipes on hand in our house. They are convenient, and are great for disinfecting kitchen and bathroom counters. I love them!	&&&
My Last box lasted me over 2 years and every wipe was moist and did it's job. I'm not sure there is much else to say.	&&&
I love these wipes! I clean everything from doorknobs to toilets with them. This is a must-have for cleaning	&&&
Tried most of the wipes and these are the only ones that don't give my son a rash	&&&
what you expect... quality wipes from pampers	&&&
does the job	&&&
With a new baby around these are handy to have to around to make sure everything is sanitized and clean.	&&&
These wipes are really good and effective, they're great for travelling.	&&&
"Amazing how stupidly well these work on dried crusty boogers and crap that gets on a kids face.
Not gonna lie, I have a cold right now and I use them on my own nose, lol! Keeps away the painful soreness you get from consistently rubbing with a dry tissue. Even puffs lotion aren't as nice!"	&&&
"I really love these wipes because I can remove my eye makeup without irritation. They are not very wet but they still take everything off easily. They have ""scrubbers"" on one side that help cleanse my skin. You don't have to rinse your face afterwards and it leaves it soft and smooth. I have extremely sensitive skin and have not had any reactions or irritation to this product. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great makeup remover.

I received a discounted product in exchange for my unbiased opinions."	&&&
This is a VERY good product! It dosent irritate my daughters skin at all! These are the only wipes I use! I highly recommend getting them!	&&&
Great product does exactly as it should. Leaves you feeling clean and fresh. Easy to take with you on the go.	&&&
When my baby was born the hospital said not to use wipes which greatly surprised me. So I started looking into it and realized how much chemicals standard wipes use. I was very happy when I found these wipes. They are very soft and I just use water to clean the baby. Buying in a bundle reduces the cost a bit.	&&&
These Amazon Elements fresh scent wipes are great, for the price. The scent is very fresh and light and the moist wipes clean really well. I keep them in the family car, beach bag, bathroom, even a pack in the overnight luggage bag. My kids are definitely not babies anymore but still count on these for cleaning up, everywhere!	&&&
These wipes are absolutely perfect for potty training! The packaging is awesome and fun for kids, the smell is cool, and they are flushable which is a plus.	&&&
I really like these wipes. I was previously using the Neutrogena wipes however I kept breaking out with them due to my skin sensitivity. When I switched to these I had to work a little harder to get my mascara and eyeliner off but now that I am used to them I like how they don't make me break out.	&&&
"Make up removing wipes is my way to take all make up,dirt of just clean my face after a long day. Very easy to handle, I keep them in my sink they take everything out without drying my face.
Good value and always make sure you use the amount you have to do -some make up is harder to take off than others-"	&&&
These wipes are great for baby bottoms! No diaper rash and great for sensitive skin! Would recommend!	&&&
Love the fact that it's a quick cleaning item that doesn't take two steps to get what I need cleaned.	&&&
I love all the clorox products! They are easy to use and clean great!	&&&
Does the job. Only minor annoying thing is that when it's half empty, the wipes stick together. I'll pull one sheet out and the rest would follow. But that's if I do it with one hand.	&&&
smells good but very thin wipes.	&&&
I love using these wipes to clean every room in the house. It smells fresh and does not leave a residue.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are very gentle, soft, durable and don't upset my sensitive skin. No rashes, no drying, no pimples after use. I use them on my face and body.	&&&
Great thick wipes do a great job for the little one.	&&&
I love these Handi Wipes. I use them to clean up the kitchen counters and stove. They are strong and can be washed in the washing machine and come out clean and they don't fall apart or tear. Thank you for carrying them. I can't find them in the grocery stores anymore.	&&&
This individual wrapped hand wipes comes very handy. The individual package is tiny and light-weight. You can pack a few in your purse or pocket and it will be ready to use right before a snack or a meal when you don't have access to water and soap.	&&&
Great wipes. Very durable and come in a nice large package.	&&&
These baby wipes are my girl for evertrhing. I only use sensor is because of my sensitive skin and they work great and I think the s better than the refuser wipes.	&&&
These wipes work fine, the texture and thickness is good but there is definitely an scent to them even though they are "unscented"	&&&
Love these wipes!! They're super thick have no smell and clean thoroughly without leaving any weird residue like Huggies. Also, they're so moist you'll need less wipes to clean up, therefore saving wipes in the process.	&&&
Though these wipes are thick and smell great, they broke my boys out with bumps everywhere. I am now forced to finish the rest of the wipes cleaning up spills.	&&&
"We have been using this product for a couple of years now and are very happy with the combination of how it works and the pricing (even better on Amazon). This product works best for quick cleanups when you are not looking to make a big production of cleaning whatever mess is around. As everything is kept in the bottle – and if you keep the lid closed between uses – the wipes will stay moist and ready for use regardless of how long it is kept on the shelf.

The only real negative I have is, depending upon how you store the bottle, towards the end the wipes can get very soapy and can leave a bit of a mess when using them. Sometimes, you have to use a paper towel to clean up afterwards. As such, I strongly recommend to keep the bottle upright when storing."	&&&
I LOVE LOVE LOVE Lysol wipes! I was very happy to see that Amazon had them for this price! I also clipped a 15% off coupon. The product itself is excellent. I use them to clean the wall of my dorm room, the blinds, the shelves, and even the floors! They clean very well and smell excellent. I will always buy more!	&&&
Parents were complaining the bleach smell for the regular wipes, so I bought these for the church. The teenage cleanup crew says they work well.	&&&
As the label on the back recommends, these are great for ridding the perianal region of foul odors.	&&&
The Wipe quality is really good and my kid doesn't complaint when using this. Also it doesn't have any scented flavor and hence we really love this product.	&&&
Go to product for quick cleaning! I love these and they are in all major areas of my house!!. also makes for easy cleaning for my LOs who are just starting chores!! "	&&&
We don't use these for our baby's pacifier instead we use this on his hands. These are our preferred hand wipes it has no smell or taste to them. The packaging can use a redesign but overall it's a great product.	&&&
I'm afraid all the negative reviews are correct. We've been loyal Earth's Best Baby Wipes users for the past 3 years. The most recent shipment we received was the first of the new wipes. I didn't understand the reviews because our last few shipments prior to that was the same wipes in new packaging. Now it appears there is new packaging again & these wipes are quite a bit smaller, thinner, & not as moist. Please bring back the old wipes! They were the best! We will be switching brands prior to the next order otherwise.	&&&
These wipes are perfect for my kiddos! They do smell a little weird at first, but once you get past the smell they are such great wipes. They are super soft, yet thick enough to get the job done and they don't tear. They are gentle enough to wipe noses with, too, which most of the other wipes will burn when wipes noses. Plus, great, safe ingredients so I don't have to worry!	&&&
This is the only baby wipes I trust on my baby! They work very well. Also very gentle on baby's skin.	&&&
LOVE LOVE LOVE these. Perfect size to in half into our wipe warmer. absorbs amazingly. We only use these cloth wipes. Better than others that we have tried. I wish we would have used these first before wasting money on other more expensive brands. More expensive doesn't always mean better. If you want a great wipe for a decent price, look no further. save yourself some money from trying other brands.	&&&
What can you say... they're wipes. Beats the alternative, right?	&&&
Functional and cute! Very easy to put some wipes in it and drop it in the diaper bag.	&&&
these re the only diapers that I buy. I used huggies with both of my children and I love thee diapers they do not leak at all unlike other brands I've used in the past.	&&&
My daughter wants to put everything in the toilet that looks like toilet paper so this is nice because after she is cleaned these can be flushed	&&&
Great for removing the daily grime or just wanting a fresh face.	&&&
These are awesome! I've been using them for my kids (and myself) for six or seven years. They are magic at dissolving crusty snot on your kids face and just making it disappear with one swipe! We still keep these on hand for runny noses because they are gentle and they work!	&&&
good product and good price	&&&
These wipes are very good for a sensitive bum! My child has very sensitive skin, breaks out very easily. These do the trick to prevent unnecessary break outs and rashes!	&&&
would of preferred to be packed in excrement's of 70, they are in large bags of 200 +. Good quality though.	&&&
These are good wipes. I love that the packaging is resealable and easy to open. I used these to refill my wipes holder. No issues or complains here.	&&&
Takes 1 wipe for both hands even the dark polish. Only down side is you must work fast because the wipes dry quick. But still overall great!	&&&
These wipes are thick, soft and unscented. Exactly what I want for cleaning up my 2 little boy's bottoms. Thick, so the poo doesn't come through and get me! Soft, so it feels nice on their smooth hides. Unscented, because they don't need any extra chemicals on their bodies. Love these wipes!	&&&
Let's get a little personal here. My bum loves these wipes. They are not overpowering on scent and leave you feeling clean. You can also get them in a to go size which is perfect to put in your purse for travel or overall use.	&&&
I like these wipes just fine, but we have had to have the line to our sewer cleaned out twice in two weeks since I started using them--and they pulled out all of these as the culprit. Be careful with your plumbing--we've spent a ton trying to fix this mess.	&&&
Great overall!!!! Thick and perfect for cleaning up baby!!! Most times I only need 1 and done	&&&
The wipes are good. Expected them to have an opening so that it would be used right from the bag, but, that wasn't the case.	&&&
I use these as diaper wipes for my baby. They aren't as good as the ones you can get at the hospital but they are the next best thing. They are a little big so I cut them in half. I prefer to use these and dip them in water than to use other brand name wipes that contain a lot of chemicals. As my baby has gotten older and the poops messier these also make cleaning up easy. I use about 1 box every 3 months with 5 diaper changes a day. I also like how they are individually packed.	&&&
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review from smiley 360. These wipes work wonderful! They relieve that symptoms and help me get through my day! I would recommend this to anyone!	&&&
These are great to keep in the bath room and the kitchen for the quick clean up that I need. great to have these around"	&&&
I'd give it five stars, but half of the wipes received were blue.	&&&
I have two small children and use these wipes to sanatize just about everything. I keep some in the truck, in my purse, in the diaper bag and in the kitchen and bathroom. They are great for a quick clean.	&&&
The dispenser is wonderful... I love it. The problem is that the mechanism that keeps the lid closed breaks way to easily. I bought one and had it for about 2 weeks before my toddler inevitably got to it and pushed it off the couch where it was sitting. The clip inside the case that holds the lid closed broke. I liked it so much I ordered another one being careful not to let my little one get to it this time. The second one broke a week after we had it because it fell out of my hands. The same piece broke on both dispensers. While I loved it when it worked, the fragileness of the case just does not work with little kids. (or adults who drop things...). We still use the second one, we just keep a rubber band around the dispenser. It keeps the wipes wet and the weight inside makes for easy wipe pulling while wrangling a little one. The case if fabulous... if it never gets dropped.	&&&
I assumed that since they were sanitizer wipes they would take off some washable ink we used for thumbprints. They did not do that but they were very soft and great at general cleaning/sanitizing.	&&&
The wipes are great and we have used them for over 2 years. The clutch and clean wipe holder on the other hand was a waste of money. After about a month the top part with the zipper just pulled loose from the base. This was with just an occasional use, not constant use. I was very disappointed in this.	&&&
I absolutely love these makeup remover wipe.!! I have sensitive skin and most cleaners either break me out or dry my face out. These wipes left my skin feeling soft and smooth and removed all of my makeup, I had to scrub a little on the eyeliner but one cloth removed it all! I would gladly purchase these again. I also highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.	&&&
Love the scent of these wipes! Don't break baby out either.	&&&
Dude Wipes is a great company. Not only is their product terrific, but when I reached out to them asking if they could put together some kind of gift basket for a friend of mine who beat colon cancer, they were completely accommodating! Their customer service is prompt, their wipes are great, and they definitely care about their customers. I recommend them very highly.	&&&
I love these. I love knowing they are much more natural and gentle than the leading brands. They are a good thickness and the perfect amount of wetness. :)	&&&
These are a must have in any diaper bag. Use them on the go for runny noses for any reason. I've used them after a tantrum where my almost two year old had some boogies running down her face while crying. It keeps the area around the nose nice and moisturized unlike regular tissues. They smell nice too :)	&&&
These wipes are a definite must have. Great for quick clean up jobs with kids.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes. I use them on everything , even phones. Kills germs and smells like lemon fresh ummmmmm :)	&&&
Great wipes, good quality for the price	&&&
I use these to dampened to wipe my face after cleansing. I also use them to clean my stoma when changing my colostomy bag. They are inexpensive, well made, and I love that they have cut my washing way down...no more wash clothes!	&&&
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I tried it for a week, it is really great and it helps a lot to me because I was suffering hemorrhoids for a long time! I am thankful that I've tried this product and would be very glad to purchase and use it again.	&&&
We love the wipes because they keep our baby clean but are so gentle on her sensitive skin.	&&&
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have several digestive problems and am a sufferer of Irritable Bowel syndrome. So I have had issues from constipation to diarrhea. And These wipes are excellent for both situations, I like the wipes better than the cream because I am able to carry the wipes with me without a mess happen should the tube break in my purse. It also works as well as any Preparation H product and I am able to use for many digestive issues. I would totally recommend it for women and men espically for use away from home without worrying about a tube of paste making a mess.	&&&
I love using Clorox Disinfecting Wipes! Perfect for cleaning my daughters toys, kitchen, bathroom... the whole house!	&&&
I started using these wipes for the first time within the past week to clean off desks, counter tops, phones, door handles, etc. at work to prevent the spread of germs. They are good and certainly up to the task. It was good to see that they can be used this way and also as hand wipes. I was surprised at how similar products are more moist than these Softy wipes so that might be something for the maker of this product to consider. I also like the larger number of wipes in this container so I don't run out so quickly.	&&&
These lens wipes are definitely the best we've used. They are always very moist & do a terrific job without leaving smudges. My entire family wears glasses, so we use a lot of wipes. We've tried all other brands & believe Zeiss is worth the price. They also work great on our cell phones.	&&&
Best product to ever use, I use Huggies diapers & wipes, also as well as Pampers! I don't ever use anything other then those 2 brands!	&&&
"I am particular about the scent of baby wipes. They need to smell fresh but not over-powering. So when I gave these wipes a chance, I was hopeful. The scent was pleasant and I was happy with that aspect. However, if you use a wipe warmer, these wipes break-down when used. The heat makes them fall apart and leave undesirable little remnants on baby's bottom.

If you have a wipes warmer....use the Costco Kirkland kind instead. Cheaper and don't disintegrate."	&&&
Clorox Wipes are SO convenient it (almost) makes me feel guilty!	&&&
"I use Boogie Wipes on a regular basis for wrangling my son's sinus and allergy issues. I love these wipes! They're soft, thick, and smell wonderful. Unlike diaper wipes, which have a high alcohol content and tend burn, irritate or dry out facial skin, Boogie Wipes are soothing and tend to leave skin soft and supple. It's hypoallergenic, which is great because as an infant, his skin was easily irritated. He's 16 months now, and likes the packaging and the smell. Sometimes, he'll bring the package to me and make a sniffy face because he wants to practice blowing his nose. He only does this with Boogie Wipes. tissue is a no-go."	&&&
These wipes get my glasses way cleaner than the spay and cloth method. They are easy to put in a purse, too, or in the car. They wipe away all body oils and make up and dust and dirt in an instant. It's a clear day and I can see forever!	&&&
We love how these wipes work. They smell so nice and they leave our little ones skin clean and soft. By far the best we have ever tried!	&&&
I have tried other makeup removers in the past. But as long as tarte keeps making these I'm game! I love the ease that it takes products off (though I don't wear waterproof so I can't speak for that). Also the smell is nice and these wipes have tartes maracuja oil. Can't go wrong!	&&&
"""I love sensitive wipes for my baby's sensitive skin.

Easy to use and soft.

Good for baby and the whole family for everyday use. """	&&&
These wipes smell great! However they are too thin and tear easily. They are good for the face and quick messes, but I use different wipes for diaper changes.	&&&
We use these wipes all the time. Love the fresh baby smell. Never had an issues with them.	&&&
These are our favorite wipes! They get the job done, don't have a scent, and are super thick! We love them!	&&&
I have tried all kinds of prepped wipes to clean eye and sun glasses, smart phone screens, etc., etc. These are without question the absolute best. A little small for most computer monitors, but they do work very well, and are plenty big enough for lap tops. These wipes do everything you want them to and leave your screens and glasses absolutely streak free. They are the only ones I have ever used which do so.	&&&
I really like these Clorox wipes! They are very convenient and good to have on hand to clean and sanitize!	&&&
Great moist wipes with a really refreshing scent. No complaints here!	&&&
I always buy Huggies Naturals wipes. I wanted to see if these are really thicker. They have a scent whereas the naturals do not. They are maybe a half and inch longer, but not any thicker than the Natural wipes. Just FYI if you are trying to decide between the two.	&&&
The wipes are effective and do the job needed. Instead of using a half a dozen each time I only have to use one. My only complaint would be the sensitivity to skin. My daughter has really sensitive skin and these would sometimes dry out her skin.	&&&
"I am a contact wearer who works nights. Previously I have tried Cliradex wipes, but didn't seem to have much success with relief of the dryness and itchiness which led to continued rubbing. I have started using Blephadex and my eye's (especially the lids) are noticeably more comfortable; less irritated. I found the wipes to be moist (not dry as reported in some reviews), and convenient to carry with me while working.

I will purchase Blephadex again. I have found it to be a superior product and am happy with the results."	&&&
"I love boogie wipes. I use the plain ones and they are amazing. They aren't too soapy but they keep my daughters nose clean without rubbing it raw. It's the only thing she will let me use on her nose."	&&&
These wipes are so soft and enjoyable to use! I prefer them over most other wipes and highly recommend them!	&&&
I love these wipes I was introduced to these wipes at the hospital and I was impressed of the quality that after I ran out of the ones the hospital provided I immediately sent my hubby to buy the biggest pack he can find.They are so soft and with just 2-3 wipes you can clean out a very dirty diaper. These wipes are a lil too wet but I don't mind and they don't smell but do clean very well I use these for other messes but overall I definitely do recommend to all moms and new moms these are Sensitive and very very Good in quality!! I've been buying these wipes for over 3 and a half years!!! Really the best I've tried so far and the only ones I will continue to buy!	&&&
I have a 4 year old boy and I love how Clorox is easy to use and I feel confident that the surface has been disinfected and ready to go for his next adventure.	&&&
Being the mom of two young children, clorox wipes are a must in my household. Every spill my two children do is not an issue when I have clorox wipes around. I love these wipes. They are fast, easy and convenient to use.	&&&
Honestly I think this is the best wipes ever due to it's thickness of cleaning your baby. You don't have to use so much to change your baby. Plus my children are so sensitive down there this is the only product that doesn't break my children out. I used to buy Pamper wipes, but when I started these I haven't went back. I've always been a Pampers mom, but Huggies are now my favorite. I would highly recommend this product to anyone and I do. Especially to my friends that are expecting because the more wipes you don't use the best you're going to save on money too.	&&&
MalAKet wipes fix my pugs itchy, irritated pee-pee within a day or two. It's a staple in my 3 dog home!	&&&
Yes, they clean your monitor screen. But the wipes are very hard to get out of the container and several ripped during removal. You need a better way to dispense the material."}},	&&&
We use those wipes at our household all the time. It disinfects and cleans at the same time. A must have.	&&&
Subscribe and save is awesome. Just when I look in the closet and see I have 2 packages left a box arrives on my doorstep. I highly recommend subscribe and save.	&&&
To small to clean anything, if you need this antiseptic to clean a cut, they are difficult to use due the small size.	&&&
"My wife and I have both beat cancer and from that point on we use a wipe every time we can't wash our hands. since then we have had very few sicknesses over a 10 year period. each wet one will clean two uses.

The Singles package could be made a little smaller"	&&&
Great buy	&&&
“I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.” These are quick relief, easy to transport and reasonably priced.	&&&
I recieved this product stricly for review purposes. While testing the product, I found that the product does exactly as it claims to do. It holds true to the promises made by the manufacturer. I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from this problem. Great Product!	&&&
I love Lysol wipes! we usually buy the big pack from Costco. Makes everything smell clean and germ free!"	&&&
Great for those that have sensitive skin. We don't have any babies, but we use them on our dogs every night because they sleep in the bed with us. Removes allergens and removes makeup really great without causing breakouts or allergy problems.	&&&
These are my absolute favorite wipes and we are on kid #5. They are excellent for sensitive kids and the soft package keeps wipes wet. Just perfect all around.	&&&
"I am practically OCD when it comes to smudges on my glasses. It drives me nuts to see smudges or streaks, and I keep wipes and microfiber cloths readily available pretty much every where I go.

I have tried some of the ""store brand"" moistened cloths and they seriously must not know the definition of streak free, because those things left my glasses looking like I had cleaned them with an old oil cloth.

These are truly streak free. I still don't think they do as great of a job as a spray-on cleaner and microfiber cloth, but they do a pretty ggood job and are a decent value."	&&&
Would definitely recommend to other parents. It is as thick as huggies wipes and I love the fragrance. Great value and great deal for price. My son and I are both happy with it!!!	&&&
I love pampers products, I am not really a fan of the scent of these wipes so I use the sensitive.	&&&
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I am a member of Smiley360. In my opinion, the wipe was helpful at first, but after only about 10 minutes, my symptoms returned. The upside is that the wipes made me feel cleaner.	&&&
Value was great, but the wipe is a bit rougher than most wipes.	&&&
Best brand of wipes	&&&
I bought these wipes and.they were so great, it is a good size package and the wipes are soft.and.very gentle.on my.little girls delicate skin. It also gets her effectively clean. I will continue to choose this brand over the others.	&&&
I love how big these wipes are. I am able to clean up messes with just one wipe instead of several of other brands. They don't really smell like much, which I like. My son has very had any issues with them on his skin. I sometimes get ones that tare as I am pulling them out of the package, but I really feel like that is to be expected with any wet wipe.	&&&
I ordered these wipes 3-4 times in decent sized quantities and I did not like these because they were very thin and soapy. They left residue on my baby and I felt like I had to wipe her with plain water after using these wipes. What I did like about these wipes is that some of the packages have a locking lid that keeps the wipes from drying out. We do not use disposable wipes or diapers full time, so I do not rely solely on any type of disposable wipes, but I have found our go-to wipes brand that are neither soapy or too thin. (babyganics)	&&&
I think these wipes are great! Yes they have a funny smell but they're worth it. I do use them in conjunction with a regular eye make up remover so I use the wipe to get off any excess eye make up and then my face make up. Definitely better than your standard drug store brand of make up wipes. Plus these wipes are a 30 count and come in a container that locks as opposed to the other wipes that just simply have a plastic flap with some sticky stuff on it. This prevents the wipes from drying out. I will definitely keep purchasing these wipes as a part of my daily cleansing routine. I am new to using Kat's products and so far I love them all!	&&&
I am happy with the wipes. They are kinda thin and not too soft. I like their smell, it's lemony. I use them on my hands and many surfaces like door knobs, phones, countertops, table tops. Frankly, I can't know how well they disinfect but makes me feel safer.	&&&
These are pretty decent wipes. In my opinion they seem prone to slipping around, are less soft/thick, and less absorbent than pampers wipes. But you can get the job done.	&&&
very durrable and protects the wipes from drying or getting things into them. i love these wipes too they are so soft and gentle great for babies.	&&&
You know this is one of my favorite brands and i love their wipes, however i was pretty disappointment with this re-branding. I just wasn't really impressed.	&&&
I use these wipes on anything that anybody touches at home and at work. I love that they come in a container that's convenient to have around and how each wipe is the perfect size	&&&

These are great they do the job perfectly , they remove your makeup with ease .The exfoliating side gently scrubs your skin.You will feel refreshed and amazing after you are done .I have tried many makeup remover wipes and they don't compare to these .

I highly recommend this product ."	&&&
After my 3 year old eats pancakes, there's syrup every where! Luckily with Clorox wipes, it take just a quick swipe and the table's clean!	&&&
Great little wipes for eyeglasses, sunglasses, camera lens, etc. Great price as well.	&&&
these are amazing. dealing with snotty, runny, crusty noses is no fun in our house and usually leads to buckets of tears after a meeting with the tissue. they're so soft and wipe away all of the funk easy peasy, especially after naps where my child seems to wake up even crustier. boogie wipes are the best come cold and flu season and when allergies are full blast.	&&&
I actually use these to wipe my kitchen counters instead of chlorox wipes.	&&&
These wipes are really plasticky. They're not the soft cloth-like wipes similar to Target store brand or Kirkland wipes.	&&&
Wipes are on the thin side, like pampers. But they are identical to Sams club Members mark baby wipes. No smell at all, loved the textured side. However these wipes dry up within minutes and continue to do so in the plastic tubs. maybe the flip top packages wont have quite an issue with this but the refill packages have to stay closed to maintain the little moisture they have. They would not do well in a wipes warmer at all. I tried rewetting them in several different ways and it always resulted in a soggy wipe that stuck together, they would almost disintegrate with too much moisture. They also tore very easily. I will be sticking with Huggies wipes from now on.	&&&
I love the simple wipes so I decided to try these exfoliating wipes out and they suck! They're really dry, not wet like the regular simple wipes and they have a very harsh texture! Super disappointed with these and will not be buying them again, ill stick to my original simple wipes.	&&&
I would give these wipes 5 stars if it was just the product! I love them.. But they don't dispense well. It's really difficult to get individual wipes out. I always end up getting 2-4 wipes at a time. Kind of frustrating. I honestly have no idea of that's something hat can be adjusted or fixed.. Only writing this to give company heads up.	&&&
I use these to clean up my kitchen counter top when any spills occur or just to wipe up my kitchen table afterwards. They're great!	&&&
Buy this! We use both cloth and disposal wipes and I wanted something slim to carry them in. These are perfect! They hold plenty of disposable wipes for a day out and keeps them moist if you don't use them all. I had left some in the pouch for over a week with no problem :). We loved them so much I bought a total of 4, 2 for me 2 for my husband and we each carry a set of cloth and set of disposable. I like them also because they close nicely and I don't have to worry about cracking the case. Also can't beat the price!	&&&
good use with rosacea skin problem	&&&
I really like these Clorox Wipes for quick cleanup and disinfecting! They are great to have on hand when handling chicken.	&&&
Husband uses a Bi-pap machine and loves how these wipes removes the facial oil from the mask. No residue. No odors. No mess. No germs. How easy is that? One wipe is all he uses per day. Well worth the price.	&&&
These wipes are excellent for my baby's skin, especially for her skin being a little on the sensitive side	&&&
With 5 kids including a toddler, these make cleaning so much easier in our household. My go to product every time.	&&&
These are great! I used to buy name brand wipes and then i saw these at Wal-Mart. I love them and they cost a lot less. My only complaint is that sometimes they are hard to get out of the container and then you end up grabbing like 5 at a time. Other than that i love them!	&&&
Love these wipes! Killing germs and sanitizing everything in a wet wipe makes it super easy!	&&&
Great transaction. Awesome wipes	&&&
My only problem with this is that I don't have enough wipe containers around the house anymore. I've been buying self-contained snaptop packaging, and these are simple zipper resealable bags. This is a savings over even the generic store brand locally, though, so I'll figure out the container thing.	&&&
I have to say this are by far the best! Wipes ever you can use them constantly and disinfect real well	&&&
Love the quality of this product and the price! I also like that they are little larger than most baby wipes and seem much thicker. I don't have to use 5 baby wipes to do an easy job. I've used Pampers brand wipes and they are almost "greasy" feeling. Love the smell, but they are super thin and tear easy. These are excellent and a super buy for the price! You will love the HUGGIES brand wipes!	&&&
I was lucky enough to receive a sample pack to try out. While my children are all school age and have little use for wipes, I am the aunt to two little ones. in addition to cleaning up lil ones, i also use wipes to remove makeup, clean up after a workout, to clean leather and mirrors. These wipes are sensitive enough for my face (i suffer from eczema and very dry skin) to clean without any discomfort or irritation and strong enough to clean up lil messes with one wipe. These caused zero irritation or discomfort between myself and my two nieces. Scent free and moist but not too wet..... I highly recommend these for anyone with sensitive skin	&&&
We used these wipes for the past 2 years. They were great, 5 stars, until they changed them recently. The new material feels more synthetic and is very slippery, where as the old material seemed more paper based. I also noticed that with this new material, these wipes are no longer biodegradable, where as the old version was biodegradable. It's very disappointing when a company take a great product and changes it for the worse. After receiving my most recent order we immediately switched to Seventh Generation wipes.	&&&
Don’t waste your money.	&&&
These wipes were not as expected - they tore and broke apart too easily.	&&&
I have a pack of these in my diaper bag and they are so convienent, my mom bought them for me when we were out of town, I didnt have an aspirator and these did the trick! I use them all the time now, I would highly recommend this product. Only down side is they are pretty large for what you need them for, so you go through the package quickly.	&&&
These work great, are sturdy, and are versatile. They can be used in many different surfaces in your home. I do prefer wipes with less harsh chemicals however.	&&&
The scent is too strong for my taste. If I didn't know it was all natural ingredients, I would think they were soaked in a cheep perfume. Otherwise the wipe does what it's supposed to do.	&&&
Best wipes! Never an issue with these!	&&&
They don't separate easily and I have to keep scraping across the top to find the edge and lift it.	&&&
great idea... but it leaves streaks.	&&&
These wipes are alright! I wanted something more cotton! Didn't realize they were flannel.	&&&
I am very impressed with these wipes.	&&&
I just started using these wipes after they were recommended by a friend. I am perplexed by the reviews that state the wipes are small and somewhat dry. I love them and actually find them to be too big! If I am not wearing a lot of makeup on some days, I will rip the wipe in half and save half in a baggie for the next day, Great product and price.	&&&
These wipes are very gentle on my babies sensitive skin. The only thing I do not like is that sometimes they leave some stringy lint behind.	&&&
"great wipes"	&&&
I buy pamper product for all of my babies!! Love the easy refill wipes. I buy these all the time.	&&&
If you aren't occasionally wiping down your child's gums, you're being a bit foolish -- you wouldn't wait a year to brush your teeth, right? These are very convenient. I suggest cutting them into smaller bits because each is far too big for one infant's mouth, and they're pretty costly per wipe.	&&&
Love these wipes	&&&
This wipes are great just hope and wanted them to be larger and thicker but overall great product definitely recommend these wipes great use for almost anything.	&&&
These are very good wipes!! They always get the dirty deed done right!! Good job Clorox!!	&&&
Such a cute gift for the bride to be!	&&&
I love to use these wipes to clean counters, floors, etc in between my deep cleaning days. They have a pleasant smell & I trust them to clean & disinfect all my surfaces.	&&&
The wipes are thick, pleasant smelling and work great for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces throughout my home.	&&&
"I have to admit that 8 years ago (before having 3 kids) I would never have guessed that I'd become something of an expert with strong opinions about wet wipes. These aren't the worst wet wipes I've ever used, but they're definitely not the brand of wipes I want on hand when there's a blow-out diaper.

1. THE SMELL. Dear lord the smell. My kids opened a pack of wipes when the package first came. I honestly thought they'd gotten in to room freshener spray and sprayed scenty stuff all over the room. It was over-powering. I've become used to the fact that a room smells to high heaven after the wipes are open for even a short time, but I don't enjoy the smell at all. This, however, can be easily corrected by ordering unscented next time.

2. They don't work particularly well. I mean, sure, they get the job done. And the child definitely smells fresh afterwards! The material just doesn't work as well as other wipes. I'm not sure if it's the material or the dryness of them, but they don't work as magically as some other brands.

3. The aforementioned dryness. When the top of the containers are left open for even a short time, the top few wipes are all dried out.

4. BUT I love that each pack is a stand-alone container of wipes. No refilling hassles or needing special containers. They can just be everywhere in the house that I need wipes.

Ultimately, when the price is right I'd probably buy them again. But they'll never be the only brand I have in the house because I'll keep good wipes on hand for when these just won't get the job done."	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes! I use them in the kitchen, bathroom, and to clean up messes left behind from my toddler. The wipes are almost moist never dry and they are scented fresh leaving behind a clean smell. Also they clean through dirt and grease. I can't live without these wipes. They are part of my cleaning supplies.	&&&
"Perfect for the quick wipe down of the kids chairs at the kitchen table and also the high chair.
Even for the dirty finger marks on the refrigerator."	&&&
Got these on a special promotion thinking they wouldn't be that great. They turned out to be super soft like the Pampers wipes. No complaints here!	&&&
These wipes are a must have for potty training! They help my son wipe on his own!	&&&
Easy cleanups for the bathroom and kitchen...always keep some in both rooms for convenience.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. I use them to clean everything, I especially use them in the kitchen at my work because for some reason no one here knows how to clean....	&&&
These wipes are large and have a textured finish that helps to remove grime, dirt, oil, whatever. They even help remove unwanted scents from contact with gasoline, diesel, oil or grease. I have tried numerous hand wipes, and these are simply the best.	&&&
These are well designed and built- I've had no zipper problems thus far and wipes stay moist. They are much sturdier than a ziploc bag.	&&&
I've used other store brand disinfecting wipes before, but none stand up to "Clorex". I take them where ever I go. They are in my locker at work, in the car, bathroom, kitchen, patio. I never run out. No bacteria around me with my Clorex disinfecting wipes.	&&&
I was hooked from the first try. I originally went with Kirkland wipes because they do have the greatest value. I didn't like the strong scent or the harshness. Someone bought me these wipes and I was hooked from the first use. No scent. Very gentle. Worth the extra cost. Every penny. My daughter has very sensitive skin and also develops horrible rashes when teething. These are the only wipes that do not irritate the problem.	&&&
Pampers Sensitive Wipes are a must for any mom! Stock up on these before baby arrives so you don't have to run to the store to get more. I prefer this brand over all of the others I have tried.	&&&
I use these to wash my sensitive skin face! They are perfect after using a make up wipe. They leave your skin feeling soft and refreshed. I love that they don't leave a soapy feeling too.	&&&
"The product itself, which I had gotten before, is great. Wonderful for surface cleaning anything at all and does a terrific job.

Not thrilled with whoever packed/sent the order - were just tossed in a box, all 3 were had cap tops that just fell off so that the wipes were exposed , one was cracked and broken. Packer just dud not care."	&&&
The sensitive wipes are my favorite.Gentle for newborns and strong enough for messes a crawler makes. I love the package sizes available, great for your diaper bag and refills for your nursery. The bigger the package the more $$ you save.	&&&
These are really great wipes.	&&&
Used to be a GREAT product a few years ago. One of the only wipes that does not cause diaper rash on our very sensitive kids. Just started using them on our baby and they TEAR APART pulling them out of the dispenser. And they tear apart while wiping which is so gross and disgusting if you are wiping a poop and it tears apart and then you have poop ALL OVER your fingers and under your nails. I contact customer service just now because it just happened to me again!! We will see what they say. I think they have created a cheaper wipe to encourage everyone over to their more expensive one and done.	&&&
LOVE THE WIPES VERY MOIST AND SOFT. THEY DON'T DRY OUT FAST LIKE OTHER BRANDS I HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST. I WILL BE RECOMMENDING TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS.	&&&
Love this! it has a weighted piece in it that holds the wipes down so it is easy to retrieve one at a time. and with the weight being bright green you can see as it goes down that you need to think about refilling so your not stuck with a mess and no wipes!	&&&
Great to keep on hand!	&&&
Love this diapers I think there the BEST ones ever they keep the odor inside NO leaking doesn't go thru his clothes I so recommend this product !	&&&
I really enjoyed using these wipes. They didn't break him out and left him looking and feeling clean. Although I had horrible luck with the actual diaper brand, can't say I have any tiff with the wipes.	&&&
These are the only wipes I will use. They are thick and are perfect for the one wipe jobs. There are many times that one wipe is all I need because they are so durable.	&&&
LOVE Clorox wipes! I have them in the kitchen, in the bathroom...a day doesn't go by when I don't use one. It nice to have something so convenient to use and it disinfects!	&&&
"I have to say this item has to have 10 out of 10 for quality and satisfaction ,I have been using it for 3 years and was introduced to it in America when we were on holiday.
Since we came on line and found yourselves as agents for it we now buy from you.
yours faithfully
Brenda Stanley"	&&&
I've tried many makeup wipes but they were too dry. I'm so happy I tried Aveno Ultra Calming Wipes because they are not dry and one towelette removes the day's makeup easily leaving my face red.	&&&
These wipes work well, but don't smell the best. They do what they're suppose to, but no other notable pros."}	&&&
The wipes are so convenient when a baby drops their pacifier. They don't take long to dry once you wipe. Excellent creation of a product.	&&&
I find that Lysol wipes dry out very quick, even with the canister closed. But I did buy them for back to school so I imagine they don't last very long!	&&&
I purchased these as a transition for my children who are comfortable with wipes. Great product but not so great dispenser. The kids had a difficult time pulling the wipes without getting them caught and often ended up opening the container to get to them easier, resulting in the remaining wipes drying out.	&&&
Honestly, once you use these flushable potty wipes, you won't be able to go #2 without them ever again. You feel so much cleaner using these and no toilet paper lint left behind!	&&&
not bad for the best but definitely not the best i have ever had... but they are alright	&&&
Seems like a good bang for your buck as far as natural wipes are concerned.	&&&
Since having kids several years ago I suffered with itching and irritation due to hemorhoids. I received a free sample of Preparation H® Medicated Wipes for Women through Smiley360 and was more than happy to give them a try! The box appeared much more feminine and would definitely appeal to other women as it did to me. I opened one of the wipes and was satisfied with the size of the wipe. The smell was floral and fragrant. That was a nice change from the smell of medicine in some of the other products. When I used the wipe I felt an immediate cool sensation and was happy that I did not experience any additional pain or irritation as I have with other products. It left me feeling clean and fresh. I find it helpful that the wipes are also flushable. The wipes are individually wrapped so I can easily throw them in my purse when I’m on the go. I have used Preparation H® Medicated Wipes for Women several times now and am happy that they help control my discomfort and irritation. I will definitely buy more when I run out! I'm a member of Smiley360.com, where I qualify to try brands for free in exchange for sharing my authentic feedback.	&&&
The wipes are fine, but don't plan on using the dispenser for too long. The top fell off after the first use. It's held on by a thin layer of glue. It's very cheaply made. I had to throw it away literally the day after I bought it. The hardcover diaper wipe dispensers will last a lot longer so I recommend buying one of those instead. Pampers has a great one that is always in my diaper bag now. I won't be buying anymore Huggies products!	&&&
We tried the one and done huggies wipes, but the hurt my face when I stole one to get makeup off my face. Im sure they weren't feeling great on the little one's bum. This has instead worked great and feels soft on my skin and her rear.	&&&
These wipes are good. They are quite thick and do a great job. I feel I use less wipes when they are thicker. And the added bonus is they do not make my daughter bottom break out!!	&&&
I love these wipes because you don't have to grab a whole handful at a time like the cheap wipes to get your babies bottom clean. They are thick and very durable, which makes it much easier to get the job done!	&&&
I keep containers of these wipes everywhere! Working in a medical office it gives me piece of mind knowing all surfaces with be fresh, clean and germ free all day!	&&&
I have used nothing but Pampers Sensitive wipes on my son since he was born, he is now 15 months. I love this brand. The wipes don't have a strong or nasty smell, and they never rip. They are so soft, and gentle on the skin. They work great for all types of skin, and clean up a lot with just one wipe! They will forever be my favorite!	&&&
These are good. I like that they are soapy. It is good. You can get two good cleanings out of the wipes.	&&&
Nothing is better for a runny nose or dried-on boogies than Boogie Wipes! We cannot live without these. I keep one in the nursery, one in the Pack N Play, and one in my diaper bag. We go through these quickly during cold season and winter, so I always buy the 90-count package. Way better than using tissues or butt wipes because it is gentle and hydrating.	&&&
The wipes are great scents and easy to clean up and wipe faces&hands up after a meal. Easy to use yo wipe off after a snack when out some where. Like the quality in the pampers wipes than other brands!	&&&
"The wipes are pretty small and they feel more like paper than the thick cloth type. It takes a couple wipes to fully wash my 3 month old puppy. These are better for washing off paws before coming in the house and washing the face when you don't want to wash it with water and soap. Still. I prefer the larger clothy ones.

I do like the mild ingredients. These leave my puppy super soft and shiny."	&&&
I liked these wipes. They are very good for cleansing the skin and remove make-up.	&&&
I use eyedrops that leave an opaque deposit in the inner corner of my eyes. These wipes remove the deposit and clean my eyelashes as well without being irritating.	&&&
"With two little girls in diapers, I hate running out of wipes when on the go or even on one side of the house as opposed to the other.

This multipack is great because it provides me with both travel packs and hard cases that I can reuse over and over again!

Add in the price savings and I don't know why anyone would buy anything else!!!"	&&&
These wipes have so far done a great job with cleaning my pets bottoms!	&&&
These wipes are the best I have found for my 2 year old. He has super sensitive skin and these are the softest and gentlest compared to all other wipes we've tried.	&&&
These wipes are AMAZING for us! My kiddos suffer from pretty bad allergies and get crusty noses when they sleep sometimes. These wipes are gentle on their noses but do a great job at cleaning them up. They also smell REALLY good.	&&&
Pampers Natural Care Wipes are a great alternative to Pampers Baby Fresh wipes for Babies with Sensitive skin. They are very mild on delicate skin. They do not have perfumes and no scent. The wipes are a good thickness and they are moist enough to handle the job. I would recommend Natural Care to other parents without hesitation.	&&&
Mat wipes are pretty good...I tend to sweat a lot when doing yoga so this is a good idea. I've used tea tree before and know it's good for the skin anyway, especially for cuts, scrapes...etc. So I use these wipes for the mat and sometimes after coming in from outside...figure why not. Kind of refreshing after yard work.	&&&
I wish it gripped the poop, but aside from that this is one of my fav wipes that I have used for my nephew	&&&
Great wipes, good lemon scent. Ready to use package	&&&
Easier on the nose than a Kleenex and my son likes them a lot.	&&&
Very nice wipes, don't rip like Huggies brand and they are very soft.	&&&
These wipes are great and the scent is pleasant, but not overwhelming	&&&
I really like any pampers wipes but, I enjoy the baby fresh because they smell amazing!	&&&
I use this product more when my little one sneezes. I just wipe up his little nose and I get no fuss out of him. Plus I love that they have the saline in the wipes.	&&&
I love using the sensitive wipes on my little one. I know she doesn't have sensitive skin, but as a newborn, it's better to be safe than sorry. I love the wetness it provides to clean messes up, whether its a dirty bottom or just to do a general clean over when there is no time for a bath. I trust that Pampers Sensitive wipes will not harm my child with an over chemical scent and that it's safe.	&&&
I really recommend this product specially for newborns i have three little girls and for all three these are the wipes ive used for the first three months after i change to the regular pamper wipes but these are super soft specially for those newborn baby butts .	&&&
These wipes work amazing for sensitive skin!!! These are the only wipes the work great for my son.	&&&
The wipes do a good job of cleaning when they are damp. The problem is that the wipes dry out way too fast. They are moist when opened, but dry when reaching mid way through the pack. The competitor's wipes keep moist for a much longer period. Even the store generic brands keep moist longer. The only thing the wipes have going for it are the softness.	&&&
MalAKet Wipes are remarkably good wipes. Our Boston Terrier had an infection under his eye and was treated by the vet for a spider bite and given predisone, and at the second visit was given an antibiotic. Neither seemed to work well! It seemed that using the wipe for two days, it cleared up and hasn't returned. Thank you DermaPet.	&&&
They tear easily.	&&&
Even though the diapers I purchase are NAME-BRAND, I have no issues what-so-ever buying cheap baby wipes. These wipes are GREAT. I get them in bulk for a good price, and I don't usually have to buy more for another 2 months or so.	&&&
I absolutely love these baby wipes. Being a mom of 3 i not only use these to wipe their behind but also to clean their face, place mats, hands ect. I've been using huggies wipes for 6 years now.	&&&
Years ago, when my oldest was a wee one, I found a store brand wipe by my moms that I adored. I even cleared the shelf when our visit was over. I have never seen anything like them since then and my mom was not able to ever find them again. We picked these up for baby number four because there was a special shipping deal on them and oh my goodness am I a happy mama. They are so very close to the ones I found all those years ago. The texture is perfect, they are not too think, they come out of the package easily and they don't overwhelm you with scent. I may have actually squeed finding them again. Much better than any of the name brands I have tried.	&&&
I love how gentle and soft they are! They're amazing! I even use these to remove makeup lol. But once, I used a different brand of wipes on my son and immediately disliked them since they seemed more rough. Ever since then, i've always and will always only use Pampers sensitive!	&&&
easy to use, convenient disinfects , cleans powerfully	&&&
Pampers was recommended by the hospital and we continued to use the same. Works great.	&&&
I would give these wipes a higher rating but.... I have a few issues with them that I just cannot overlook. First of all, the price of the brand name wipes is just too much when the store brand wipes work the same way. Second, and this is my big issue- All that wasted cleaning liquid at the bottom! I hate that the last few wipes are so saturated in the liquid they just make a mess! These wipes are convenient in some ways- but I think the old spray bottle and a wash cloth are more cost efficient and environmentally friendly.	&&&
I am giving this warmer 3 stars because Prince Lionheart customer service is outstanding. The product, however, is disappointing. I bought this warmer when my daughter was born. It didn't warm the wipes and I was going through the ever fresh pillows like water. I called customer service and the rep was so helpful and kind. I received a new warmer in fewer than 3 days. I can't say enough about customer service. They are really great. The new warmer actually warms the wipes but the lid doesn't stay closed and the ever fresh pillows are a hassle and costly. I didn't call costumer service again because I don't want to be a nuisance. I think I am ready to ditch the wipe warmer altogether. I really wanted a hassle free experience but I don't think I will get that with any wipe warmer.	&&&
this product was so coo..l I got to test it out and it really did the job I was totally surprised I would totally recommend this to any one that just had a baby and just needs that extra you know....the another super thing is that it comes in small packs to put in your purse or pocket so you can be discreet .... not every one needs to know right !!! good job prep h	&&&
I use these all the time to clean my glasses and device screens (iPhone, iPad). These clean very well, do not leave any streaks and I have not had issues with any scratches. Couldn't ask for more!	&&&
I've only used pampers sensitive wipes and they work great. the case is also slim enough to slip into the diaper bag easily.	&&&
Receive a big box of wipes as a baby shower gift, love them they are way stronger and smell good and price is also awesome.	&&&
"I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.
I tried using the Preparation H Medicated wipes for women and I was pleasantly surprised. Great, light scent. Very cooling and calming. Highly recommend. Great little packs that you can put in our purse or for travel."	&&&
I received this product from smiley 360 to sample and review. I don't currently have the issues that this product is for, but after a nasty bought of stomach flu, I found these to be very soothing for the sensitive areas. So I would say this product is excellent for even minor issues. It doesn't stink like some medications of this kind do. Wonderful will use again! I received this product for free to review, regardless I am 100 % honest in any of my reviews.	&&&
This is a staple on the changing table. Especially great for middle of the night changing sessions in that I don't wake my baby up while changing him with a cold wipe.	&&&
I know I wrote a review of these when I first bought them, but it is gone. I was going to edit it with an update. Our daughter is now three years old. We bought these when she was a newborn and used them in place of disposable diaper wipes. They have been washed, bleached, washed again, sometimes multiple times a day, about a million time. Needless to say, they are a bit faded from their original colors, but they have held their shape and remained whole. We still use them. My daughter now uses them in the bath. My niece uses them to remove makeup. They have definitely stood the test of time. I would buy them again and may just buy more for myself, if these ever wear out!	&&&
I received these through Smiley360 and they work great. I was so glad I got to try these. It was awesome. Tey smell really good and helps with all the burning and itching.	&&&
"Special product for facial or home use durable too I use this for personal use only
and more the one time , good quality"	&&&
I love these! They do their job and are very discrete. The only bummer is Target no longer sells them in their stores.	&&&
This purchased proved to be a disaster. From the first package I opened I found the contents to be completely dry and of no use. When I attempted to return I was refused as the product contained a flammable substance. So I' stuck with 1000 wipes I can never use. I strongly recommend that you pass on the purchase of this item.	&&&
We have been using the babyganics wipes for the past year, and now our baby is breaking into a rash constantly. Today our nanny sent me a picture of his face broke red after using the wipes, and I finally realized that it was not anything he was eating, but that the formula changed! I was a great wipe, now we are back in the market for a new brand.	&&&
"a variety pack -- just what i needed.
animal stain? grab the yellow one.
murder scene? grab the green one.
chernobyl? the orange one.

no, i really don't know what the difference was between the colors but i do love these wipes. they're handy and less messy than grabbing a roll of paper towels and going to town with a bottle of bleach."	&&&
"I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.” I have used this product and it works great.	&&&
The wipes are very good. The size is perfect for storing in the car. Towels are moist and clean good. Very satisfied.	&&&
Love this item, it helps to keep the wipes at a warm temperature so its always nice to the touch for the little one. I am very glad we are using this product, I'll do anything for my baby to be more comfortable!!	&&&
Great wipes but the border stitching has started to come loose after 2 weeks.	&&&
When you have "bum issues" you need to keep the area clean so it can heal up better, not to mention your comfort levels. Dealing with this while away from your home adds more aggravation & potential embarassment. These portable cleansing sheets are perfect for travel or while at work. For some reason my local chain pharmacies have decided to no longer carry these, either offering a huge bright yellow bulk package (why not just print "HEY I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS!" on it & be done ), or their "house brand" which are nothing like the Prep H brand in quality or effectiveness. These also work well as regular "bathroom wipes" too.	&&&
Love these wipes. They are so gentle even on the most sensitive skin. They are durable and don't dry out easily. By far my favourite!	&&&
Ive normally a savy shopper and stick with target brand wipes which I like. But I received the pampers brand for my baby shower- they are the softest wipes - easy to use - one wipe takes everything away - very light scent-	&&&
Perfect to clean the dog or cat teeth. My dog don't mind having her teeth clean with dental wipes. Easy to clean your pet teeth with. My dog never did like the tooth brush at all but she is happy with the dental wipes.	&&&
Love that these wipes are so gentle and don't hurt sensitive skin. Don't like that you need more than one at a time and that they fall apart very easily.	&&&
When my son was first born, he had some pretty bad diaper rash. Our pediatrician recommended these over just using a cloth with water, because they help clean the ammonia off better supposedly. I think they worked really well. We put them in a wipes warmer and that made our son happy. Now that he is older, he seems to be able to tolerate any brand of unscented wipe just fine.	&&&
The beat wipes I've tried.	&&&
"These are a great idea. She is not dependent on her pacifier so I was constantly making trips to the sink to wash her pacifier off until I found these and they are a life saver and I think they get her pacifier cleaner than just washing it off."	&&&
These wipes don't remove anything. I got better results using water and a paper towel.	&&&
Made very cheap, the free one that came with a box of wipes is better. Don't buy it.	&&&
I absolutely LOVE huggies natural care wipes!!!! I've been using them on my now almost 4 month old since birth. I purchased a 624 box for only $4.30 with the help of Amazon mom. Love amazon and will continue to shop here from now on!!!!!!	&&&
The best and only wipes I've used on my Gal since birth.I wouldn't use any other brand.	&&&
Smells great, not chemically smelling at all. Get's the job done.	&&&
The case keeps opening in my diaper bag. Since it doesn't stay closed it dries the wipes out which is the whole point of having a wipes case. Would not buy this again and would return it if I could!	&&&
Good quality. I keep these in the bathroom and handy. The kids use them without issues. They are soft and durable. Smell great!	&&&
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review from Smiley360. Opinions are 100% my own. The day after I received my free sample in the mail, I started using it. I will tell you, it works quickly and it is very soothing! I think I like this formula even better than the original Preparation H. I let a pregnant friend of mine try one of the samples and she too liked how well it worked. I would definitely recommend Preparation H for women to anyone that is suffering from hemorrhoids.	&&&
Works just fine.	&&&
"I have always been a die-hard Huggies fan. Love their Pure and Natural diapers!

When I'm saving money I buy Parents Choice, which really is similar to Huggies with the exception of being thinner and (I think) a bit smaller.

A few friends of mine used Pampers wipes and raved about them. Because of this I decided to try a box and wound.up giving them away. I then remembered why I stopped using Pampers. For me, they smeared the contents of the diaper around the baby's skin instead of removing it.

Huggies has always been a little drier than other wipes (which I liked) and the ""cloth"" always felt like it had a bit of a grip to it (which I also liked) and this aided in the removal of the poo from the rear of the baby.

However, I just bought these recently and I'm really wondering if the cloth or formula changed. They seem to be functioning as the dreaded Pampers and I'm thinking right now that Parents Choice is winning the wipe battle.

I hope that this box was just an exception to my normally favorite wipes. Will keep this review updated if this is the case."	&&&
My little guy is just learning to wipe on his own and Kandoo Wipes make that so much easier. They are wet so they work much better than toilet paper but he can still toss them in the potty when he is done.	&&&
"Great wipes for your glasses or other optics.

Pros:
Individual packets are always clean and contain the right amount of cleaner/alcohol.
Do a superior cleaning job to all reusables that I have used (Microfibers and Chamois).
Great cost for a bunch of the cleaning packets.
Put a few in the laptop bag, car, etc to always have clean glasses.

Cons:
I feel bad for the waste.
The packets can be a pain to open"	&&&
I like this wipes. They are more expensive than store brands so I usually wait for them to go on sale and I stock up. They make cleaning fast and easy. If there's a small mess or I need to wipe down the kitchen really fast I can just pull out a wipe, clean and throw it away.	&&&
These really are the best around. We use them from the 5 month old, to the 6 year old to the 9 year old. Thick and tough so they catch a lot of mess.	&&&
I use Clorox wipes for everything! At work and at home. I use it on furniture when my kittens leave paw prints or litter.	&&&
"We actually use this for our dog - keeps him clean and no scooting.... This dispenser has made mine and my husbands life a little easier - we no longer have to struggle getting out a wipe, I really hate it when you pull one out and the whole container comes with it - ugh - the weight in this dispenser prevents that from happening!

Dispenser looks nice, we got the blue, and the silicone seal keeps the wipes very moist - worth every penny!"	&&&
"Caused burning and itching after a few uses, so I stopped. Consumer Repts testing was unfavorable mainly because the Cottonelle wipes don't break down easily in water and may clog pipes.

Just finish wiping by adding a little water to fresh toilet tissue, wipe, get fresh tissue and dry."	&&&
Not the least bit harsh. Cloths are quite strong, too.	&&&
My butt has never been fresher! I spend most of my time away from home and hate cheap one ply toilet paper. Every morning I throw 2 or 3 of these babies in my pocket and I know Im prepared for whatever my stomach has in store for the day. Plus I don't have to walk into the bathroom a big box of wet wipes which is great.	&&&
REALLY LOVE THESE WIPES. THEY ARE GENTLE ON MY DAUGHTERS SKIN. DOES NOT BREAK HER SKIN OUT ALL.	&&&
If you love easy and quick clean ups thwn Clorox wipes are the choice. Got a sick child then use this as it disinfects also. Always have these handy in my house.	&&&
Wipes are a must. I have them in all my cars, in the camper, and all over the house. I love them and makes me feel so much better. The only thing that isn't always good is the price. Sometimes it's hard to pass up the store brand when these can get a bit pricey.	&&&
Love these wipes use them for the kitchen and bathroom and the high hair they work and smell great would!!!	&&&
These wipes are really moist and do a great job of cleaning up after your little one. However, sometimes they can be a little too saturated and almost begin to foam like a hand soap and that I did not like.	&&&
I have mixed feelings about these wipes. I love the fact that they are quick and easy to use. I just wish they were thicker so I didn't have to use 10.	&&&
These wipes are super efficient, smell great and don't break my son out (the frangrance). I love then and would highly recommend them to other Mommies!!!	&&&
I bought these wipes to use for hiking the 4-day Inca Trail in Peru. They come in 8-count packs which was great. The wipes are maybe 5x7 (?) and they recommend one wipe per body part, but by applying strategically, you only need one wipe for your whole body- face first, chest, then underarms and "privates" last. Why waste? There was more than enough "liquid" on the wipe to make it over a 5'3" frame. They did not leave a baby smell like a lot of wipes. They also do not tear well at all- in fact, one night on the trail I tried to rip one in half to share with another hiker and we couldn't. We had to find a knife to cut it! I loved these wipes and will definitely use them again for post-jogging and other camping/hiking trips!	&&&
My second baby has such sensitive skin that regular sensitive wipes, such as pampers, just weren't sensitive enough. These wipes are wonderful! They are mostly purified water. When you have a baby with really sensitive skin, these wipes are definately worth it. My baby has been so much more comfortable since switching to these wipes. I highly recommend them to all parents, whether your baby has sensitive skin or not.	&&&
I do not like these wipes. I don't find they are very effective at wiping. And at twice the price of store brands I am very disappointed in the quality.	&&&
I love these wipes. I have 2 kids and I like to keep everything clean and sanitized. These wipes smell great too.	&&&
Fast shipping and the best wipes!	&&&
I wish I could give it zero stars. Its a low quality hard in texture wipe. Not meant for babies soft skin. After two days of use my babys skin turned red. Too bad I bought it in bulk. Now I only use pampers sensitive wipes.	&&&
I use these wipes for many reasons, there are so many people in my home that I leave a canister of these wipes on top of the tank so people wipe the toilette seat after themselves. Leaves the seat clean and I know it is fresh for the next person?.	&&&
I love these wipes because they are good for daughter's sensitive skin, being fragrance free, but I feel that I use a lot of wipes to clean her bottom. It is like the wipes are not wet enough to get everything off. Other than that one little problem, these wipes are awesome!	&&&
These are great and for the price I don't regret the purchase at all. They are strong and don't rip. They get the job done. I would definitely recommend these.	&&&
"Overall, good quality wipes. Getting them started through the ring of death can be a little painful to your finger, but once you do they self feed nicely.

I had to use 2 wipes on the initial application and cleaning. Did the dash, console, and door panels. The wipes looked pretty disgusting afterwords so I know they did a good job cleaning. The car interior looks and smells nice. The smell is just right, even with 2 wipes and is not overpowering."	&&&
I love Huggies wipes! They substantial enough to get spills from clothes but soft enough for bottoms! Love them!	&&&
Huggies wipes are by far my favorite wipes. They always manage to do a better job at cleaning my child than other brands.	&&&
I am an avid Pampers user, but when it comes to wipes, no beating huggies... And these are the best ones yet	&&&
This really is the only face wipe I buy! Other brands leave an oily residue that's uncomfortable and leads to more breakouts. Not that I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I think those other brands wouldn't mind me breaking out so I can buy more of their product. Just a theory. I recommend Simple, and especially the exfoliating wipes to all my friends who enjoy wearing makeup.	&&&
Um ok if you are not using Huggies baby care wipes you need to learn today. These are the best for my babies when they were growing up, timeless tool. And not bad for the adults as well. I mean don't you want a clean bum??	&&&
Love these wipes! No gross chemical smell. No diaper rash. Even feel ok wipping the baby's face with them. The only annoying thing is they are NOT accordian folded. You have to pull out each wipe individually and the next one does not feed out. Super annoying but worth it to know they aren't full of chemicals.	&&&
Huggies natural care wipes are amazing! This was the only wipes we used after trying store brands as well as other well known brands. The thickness of the wipes is what we loved as well as the quality!	&&&
I purchased these during a sale that made a good price a great price in hopes that this is a good quality product; and I was not disappointed. First off I have to say these are just as good if not better than the name brand wipes they compare to on the packaging. The wipes themselves are similar in thickness and in wetness. The packaging is very basic plastic with a peel and stick opening for dispensing. The wipes are folded so that they pop up as they are dispensed which can be a pain with the peel and stick opening of the packaging however they work perfectly in a name brand wipes box. Athough they are "unscented" they have a light pleasant smell to them that I prefer over the name brand. All in all these are a great product for the price.	&&&
I love all of simple's products. I have sensitive skin especially around my eyes and most makeup remover wipes make my eyes burn but these don't do that at all! They feel so soft and do a great job getting all my makeup off.	&&&
These wipes do a great job of cleaning up diaper messes. The only issue I have with them is that I find their scent to be extremely off putting. Using these tends to give me headaches because of the strong scent.	&&&
I absolutely love Clorox wipes!!! I keep some in every room and in the car! They are so convenient to have, smell so clean, and will clean any mess!	&&&
These work great, but are a nightmare to take out of the package. My three year old twins take about five out at a time and it caused a $90 plumber fee! The plumber said, "These 'flushable' wipes keep us in business." I will not be buying again.	&&&
I don't think that these wipes work any better than any other product of the same nature, but I love the way they smell and they are owned by a company that doesn't test on animals which is always a plus for me.	&&&
Perfect combo of strong and soft, even for sensitive butts! I won't use another brand of wipes after using these in both daycare and home!	&&&
"These are perfect for their intended use on eyeglasses, but they make me nervous using them on sensitive optics (with expensive coatings) like camera lenses or high end binoculars. When wet they are ok for a moment, but dry quick into rough texture (almost like gentle sandpaper so to speak). Even when they are wet, they do not really absorb oils out the equipment lens, they merely circle them around into a fainter smudge.

Again, keep them for eyeglasses, but make me nervous on expensive stuff."	&&&
I love these flushable wipes! My son loves them too! They have a easy access push top lid so its convient for my son to get them on his own without help.	&&&
Absolutely LOVE these! Received a sample and actually went out to buy more! Works great on my sensitive skin. The price wasn't bad either, cheaper or comparable to other face wipes. The smell wasn't as great as I had hoped for but I am happy with them and will continue to use them! :)	&&&
These are great as usual, I love all the pampers brand wipes, hard to pick the best!	&&&
HELP! TOTALLY ADDICTED TO THESE! Forever been buying these Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, they are so handy; insomuch that My Son keeps one in his truck, his wife in her car, and we have them all around my house; always there and always handy! EVER SINCE THEY'VE BEEN AVAILABLE, we have seen a tremendous reduction of everyone getting sick such as colds, flu, even measles outbreak alert - when things got bad; we made sure they were around. In fact, All of us always yank a sheet or two before we go into shopping at the store to wipe the grocery or shopping carts as the ones the Store has are often out; it has made a tremendous difference in our lives now! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THEM! In fact, my daughter in law makes it a habit of cleaning door knobs every other day!	&&&
"I've tried other wipes and I keep coming back to these. I have nothing but nice things to say about these:

* They're thick and absorbent.
* They have a good amount of moisture, without being sloppy.
* The liquid dries quickly on baby's bottom so I'm not trapping moisture inside the diaper.
* They smell nice.
* They come out of the wipe warmer easily without clumping up.
* They don't cause dryness or any skin irritation.

I use them for wiping baby's hands and face after a meal. It's hard to get excited about something you use to wipe a baby's bottom, but these are the best I've ever used. I'd definitely recommend them over any others I've come across."	&&&
The wipes are gentle on your skin. And gets rid of all your make up with one wipe. These are my new favorite make up wipes now. I'll probably only be buying these from now on.	&&&
I always have these wipes on hand at work at home and in my car. It is great for quick and convenient clean up and to be able to quickly toss into the trash, I buy the big rolls of these wipes from Costco.	&&&
I've used the Green Works spray, so I wanted to try the wipes and I am in love with them. I've always been a huge fan of wipes for ease, but what I love about these is that they don't have harsh chemicals that burn your hands, and after I clean with them, my hands feel clean and are not covered with any of the gross, sticky or nasty residue that most cleaning wipes leave behind. I'm a huge believer in Green Works and will continue to use it to clean my house.	&&&
My puppy was allergic to the wipes and they have an off putting scent. Regular baby wipes work well; particularly for dogs probe to skin sensitivities	&&&
Love these wipes!!! Excellent brand, used them all the time! For dirty diapers, wash toddlers hand or face!!	&&&
Simple review. I love these wipes! I am sure everyone who has used them agrees, and if you have yet to use them.. go buy some! I am a neat freak and live by these things. I have the to go ones in my bag, car, dorm, everywhere. Check them out for yourself. You will be happy you did.	&&&
From prior comments, I thought the aloe scent would be a problem. It wasn't. However, I did not expect the wipes to feel so "silky". I personally don't appreciate the "sliding" while cleaning up a baby's bottom. Maybe this protects the skin better but it doesn't give me an impression of a "good clean". It's a bit disappointing. I was looking forward to using my full subscription of this product and now I am definitely cancelling and switching to another product.	&&&
I meet up with my mommy friends a few times a week and last week I showed them my sample of Seventh Generation Free & Clear Wipes. We all had a picnic in the park and I handed out the wipes to wipe the little dirty hands before eating. The moms were all impressed with how the wipes worked and that they're free of alcohol, fragrances, parabens and dyes.	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes, this are my favorites by far. They have no fragrance which is important to me and they are strong enough to clean up mess but still really soft and gentle with my baby's skin. Plus, huggies has a lots of promotion on this very often.	&&&
Clorox helps me every time my food fall on my white kitchen floor leaving it strain-free. Love the smell.	&&&
These wipes are great! The fabric they are made of does not tear easily, unlike the Huggies Pure and Natural I was using before. With the Huggies, I would constantly find my fingers in poo. They would tear anytime the mess was the least bit sticky. Not these! When I first got them I tried to tear them and found that they STRETCH and are difficult to rip. They also leave no sticky residue. Five Stars.	&&&
These are awesome. They are good for a little fresh up. Should of been on market a long time ago. Definitely worth it.	&&&
Received this product free from Smiley 360 to try and then to review. Wonderful product for women! Gentle, effective, and not intrusive! They actually heal and sooth.	&&&
Easy to use, best on the market. Wonderful seller, fast shipping	&&&
Works great and durable	&&&
Great Deals!!	&&&
Huggies Wipes are the only wipes that don't irritating my daughters skin. She has very sensitive skin and these are perfect.	&&&
I have recommended this product to many of my family and friends with little ones or little ones on the way. I do not like any other brand. The product is one of the best I have bought and like to use. My little one is also sensitive to certain wipes and diapers and buggies is the best. They also smell really good.	&&&
Pampers wipes are a good quality however I wish they were a little thicker	&&&
These wipes are great—soft, not soaking wet like some other brands, and our son reacts just fine to them.	&&&
Super gentle and removes all types of makeup. I enjoy throwing these in my gym bag and keeping them in my bedside table for those lazy nights where makeup removal is the last thing on your mind. Great for sensitive skin and for use around the eye area!	&&&
Love the purity of these wipes. And great value!	&&&
I got this for after gym class to put in my gym locker at my High School, I don't wear makeup at all ever but I do get very oily especially my t-zone and my nose. Yesterday night after washing my face in the shower I tried one of the wipes on my face but not near my eyes. Maybe 5 seconds after my face got every hot and itchy and red, I waited a minute and when that didn't subside I washed my face with cold water and my face was fine after that, thank god I didn't get it near my eyes. I also read other reviews saying that there is EDTA in this product which is a harsh chemical, this product false advertised that there is no dyes, chemicals or perfume in it. Unfortunately I have blonde hair and blue eyes which means I'm very sensitive to allergies and I also have sensitive skin, I really wanted to use this for school but now 6 bucks wasted I have no idea what to do with them. Never use any new products without reading the reviews first.	&&&
Love these little handiwipes for carrying in the briefcase, car or luggage. You never know when you'll need a sanitizing wipes and the single individual packaging keeps them at your fingertips. Always keep them stocked in my car as I said the smell is not problematic and it does not seem to be as harsh as some of the hand sanitizers that come bottles.	&&&
I love clorox wipes. I use them to clean everything from the bathroom sink to inside of my car.	&&&
I was glad that these were easy to use on the go and without a mess like traditional creams. It lets you be comfortable and Deseret .	&&&
my baby never breaks out with these wipes she has such sensitive skin	&&&
I love the lemon scented wipes and keep several around the house. I keep a container in my bathroom for a quick wipe of the sink and toilet rim and seat. I also keep one in the kitchen and also in my car. They are great for wiping up spills and have the added bonus of disinfesting. There is also a container in my office to give a quick clean of my desk.	&&&
IMO, the best wipes been using for 4 kids and still keep in the house and car for quick clean up.	&&&
Great product great price. Subscribe and save is the best	&&&
These wipes are very convenient to have if you own silver jewelery. They work pretty well and the price is fair. The treated cloths for cleaning silver are also worth owning.	&&&
Great deal.	&&&
i like having both the duster and monitor wipes. I use the duster for many other uses around the house.	&&&
We love pampers wipes and really anything pampers and you can't beat the Amazon Mom price!	&&&
It's pretty good stuff, easy to use, and not to toxic.	&&&
Got it for $14.82 and I think it's a great a value. Very satisfied with the quality and the quantity. will come back for more.	&&&
"My daughter has been having a runny nose for a couple of weeks and this product helped not irritate her skin which was extremely important to us."	&&&
I love these Huggies one and done wipes. The smell of the cucumber and green tea is very refreshing for my baby. Also these are thicker than the other wipes I was getting. I use these on my dogs paws when he comes in from outside as well. These are sturdy wipes. I also use them myself. You cant beat the price of these WIPES anywhere. Great quality!!!! These wipes cause no rashes on my son either. I now have the Huggies dash button as well as Gerber. I love these buttons. One is on the changing table and one on the fridge. I just hit the button and my wipes are delivered. What a great idea!! Same with my formula. If you have a baby I highly recommend the dash button. These wipes were highly saturated so much so my old diaper wipe box didnt fit them. They did send me another box and I had to put these wonderful wipes in there. My little guy has no bad reaction to these at all. I was skeptical about getting scented wipes but Huggies does a fantastic job.I only use Huggies wipes. I have tried other brands. Some rip apart some are dryer some you need 6 to clean up. My search ended in his 2nd month. I will stick with my Huggies one and done. Now if only I could find the shea butter Huggies on Amazon. I haven't seen them yet. Oh also these wipes are lasting me about a month and a half. Like I said I use them on baby my dogs paws and me. I go through alot of wipes a day. I can't say enough about this great brand great wipes and the price point. My little guy has a sensitive bum as well and no problems with these. I am a loyal customer!! Happy baby doggie and mommy!!	&&&
I simply LOVE these wipes! They hold up through even the biggest diaper blowouts. They are so much better than Huggies wipes, which fall apart like a wet paper towel!	&&&
These are my favorite wipes so far! They are gentle on my sons' skin, are easy to take out of the container with one hand (and not taking three additional wipes with it!), and are a great value.	&&&
I have 5 kids and when they were newborn I felt bad wiping their bottoms with cold wipes. I finally gave in a bought the warmer. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't hold lots of wipes. They don't dry out and they are not cold, that I like.	&&&
I really love these wipes! I use them constantly. I use them from cleaning my bathroom to cleaning my desk. I love them!	&&&
Love this product. Both my kids have sensitive skin and this is the only wipes that work well for them.	&&&
Great Pricing and an abundance of wipes! Perfect for my little one!	&&&
These are the only wipes I'll buy. They hold true to their name thick and clean. I no longer buy store brand wipes because I always end up using more of them, in turn having to buy more packages. Packages of these wipes last a long time which actually saves money. The thickness of them also helps keep the "ick" factor under control when we have messy changes to take on.	&&&
I really liked the idea of having such convenient wipes, but sadly they dried up in the container in a short period of time, making them useless. Due to that I will never buy them again.	&&&
I got these wipes as part of a gift. On first glance, I thought they seemed really small and wondered if they would remove all my makeup. After using them, my skin itched, burned and turned pink. I won't use them again and will stick to my Yes to Blueberries wipes which I love.	&&&
"I bought these wipes to freshen up before leaving work and they are good. I get sweaty and have to stand in line at a time clock causing me selfconcious of body odor, we'll not anymore.
I also buy them for my neice she uses them after her crosscountry and track meets before getting back on the bus. The fact that an 18 yr. old had me get her more says it all."	&&&
Hands down the best wipes ever. I love the thickness of them and I don't have to worry about my fingers breaking through while wiping my little one tush.	&&&
nice dispenser. the weighted plate keeps the wipes in place and they do come out one at a time.nice easy one handed opening mechanism. wipes stay moist. no complaints.	&&&
These face wipes are my favorite right now. They take off most of my makeup and do not dry out my skin as much as other brands. The only down side is I need an additional eye makeup remover so I don't have to scrub and pull around my eyes.	&&&
These have become my go-to for dirty surfaces including countertops, bathrooms, and doorknobs. They are easy to use and I feel like everything is so much cleaner after using them. Anytime there's a dirty surface, I run and get these wipes!	&&&
I carry these in my purse, especially when I go to the grocery store and the store doesn't have the sanitize wipes to wipe the buggies.	&&&
The only wipes I'll use! Unscented, fewer chemicals, no harsh reactions, stay moist, and are super durable. Honestly very quality wipes, I won't use any other!	&&&
As a preschool teacher, Clorox wipes have become a must in my routine and are defininTly worth the cost. Love the smell and the quality!!	&&&
I absolutely love this brand- and these wipes are perfect for my bedside table. They definitely do not replace actually washing my face, but after a late night out, this is better than nothing! I also keep a pack of the 'Exfoliating' wipes in my purse to freshen up midday. I cannot recommend Simple brand enough- they often have coupons and deals at Target, so be on the lookout!	&&&
Love them! They are so much bigger and sturdier than other wipes I've used. I never have to worry about poop getting on my hands because it breaks and usually most diapers are one wipe because they are just that big.	&&&
Love the convenience of the Clorox wipes! They make doing a quick clean up so easy. You don't have to deal with a bunch of different cleaners. One canister will clean pretty much anything.	&&&
The best wipes around! As a teacher and homeowner these are the ultimate necessity. Whether it is cleaning a dirty desk (especially during flu season) or wiping down the kitchen or bathroom counters this is sure to be your supply. Not to mention they smell fabulous!	&&&
I like Pampers overall as a brand, however I am not crazy about their wipes. They are gentle and soft, but I sometimes have to use 2-3 wipes to clean up my twins bottoms. I also think the scent can be over powering, when I first open a pack, but it doesn't linger so it works.	&&&
Took no time for the wipes to get to my house. Love the product.	&&&
Great job Amazon. These wipes are good value and just as good as the higher priced ones.	&&&
You can use the wipes on everything. Good for traveling with kids or the bathroom to make you feel extra clean	&&&
I always keep at least one back up container of these in my bathroom. Besides the obvious bathroom uses I use a fresh one to clean the toilet- flush-handle, all the door knobs in my apartment, mouse keyboard, light switches; anything my fingers touch on a regular basis. I use them almost daily to give the commode some quick type of wipe or another....and let's be honest (to other guys reading this review) sometimes during the night your aim is not so good and in the morning these wipes save the day. When I finish the last one off there is always some liquid left at the bottom which I pour into the next container of wipes to help keep them extra moist.	&&&
I got this with a coupon, so i didn't mind trying it out. I don't usually use wipes, so it's hard for me to compare it to other brands, but the wipes seems a little on the dry side. They seem to do a decent job with cleaning, but since it's not moist enough, I still wash my face after using them.	&&&
I love your dual action wipes. We raise puppies and the dual action wipes are a life saver for cleaning up messes that the puppies leave behind. I love the scrubber side. Great product. The only thing that I would change about them is to make them come apart easier.	&&&
The only baby wipes I use ! Get the job done . Could be a little thicker though . I love that they smell awesome .	&&&
I love having Lysol wipes on hand. With two little ones they always come in handy. These have such a nice "just cleaned" smell.	&&&
Huggies is the only brand of wipes I will use. I tried many different brands but the wipes either fell apart, smelt weird or were to rough. Huggies wipes are perfect!	&&&
I keep these stashed around the house for quick cleaning and disinfecting. Very helpful with two preschoolers.	&&&
the cases that come with it keep it airtight. love the little packs that come with it, they are helpful travel wipes. doesnt irritate my babies skin and we even use it to wipes her hands and face if she makes a mess while we travel.	&&&
Love love love this wipes. Great for cleaning up messes and sanitizing at the same time! Smells pretty good as well. Will continue buying these in the future!	&&&
Great product I love the refreshing sent and the really soft texture of the wipes for my baby.	&&&
"My some has allergies so he has a constant runny nose or his nose is completely stopped up. The saline in the wipes helps loosen up the boogies without irritating his skin."	&&&
These are great wipes that smell good without the scent being overwhelming, they are the perfect thickness for any and everything whether it's changing a diaper, wiping faces and hands, even great for wiping the counters and tables! Other wipes I've tried are either to thin, to rough, to wet/dry, to strongly scented or they say unscented but have a weird smell lol. My kids and I all have sensitive skin and these have never caused us any problems. I highly recommend these!	&&&
These not only smell good, but are strong and sensitive. Our daughter has sensitive skin and these work like a charm. I like to buy in bulk, they are affordable and most of the time I only need one wipe to clean up a mess.	&&&
This is so far the cheapest price for Huggies Natural Care wipes that I can find! I love the price but more importantly love the product. These are the only wipes I can use on my sensitive baby and they clean very well.	&&&
I love the thicker wipes! I feel like they clean better using less wipes! Totally worth it!	&&&
A bit smaller than Target wipes - but so much softer! Will be using these from now on!	&&&
Much better than any "comparable" bargain brand, these wipes are truly worth the money!! Effectively clean with one sweep.	&&&
These are great wipes. I used them from the time my baby was born until 3.5 months of age and with the amount diaper and wipes we'll need during those first few months these were such saviours. I am giving this product 4 stars only because the refills give out kind of a musty smell after half way through. The smell sometimes was worst than than my baby's poop. But apart from that i havent had any problems with these.	&&&
We use these religiously as reusable wipes for our baby and they are exactly what I wanted. Soft for baby's skin, yet very durable after many uses and washes. Perfect size and thickness...we usually only need one or two for even the biggest poopy diapers! Also great to use just for general cleaning of face, hands, etc. Definitely recommend!	&&&
These are the only wipes I have found that I do not feel the need to rinse after using. Leaves a clean, refreshed feeling that dries instantly and keeps my face from getting oily throughout the day	&&&
Our baby has very sensitive skin. This were gentle. Didn't tear and cleaned well.	&&&
Love these wipes. Use almost everyday! I would recommend these to any parent. I use them at home and at work.	&&&
Love it! A light citrus scent and strong enough to scrub off my stove top stains which is AMAZING. But it's still soft and gentle enough for wiping my kid's face and hands. It's non sticky and doesn't tear apart easily like other more expensive brands. I've been searching for the right wipes forever and I think I finally found it!	&&&
I think these wipes really have a cult following, but not for doing what they should do. They really just smell nice and that is it. I find that when I am wiping my face they smear my makeup instead of removing it and I don't expect the wipes to fully remove everything but I mean atleast pretend that the soap you have isnt stuck in the water thats in the envelope. They also dry out so very fast. I could seal them up and in a ziploc bag and come back and they will be dry. I mean once you let that steal rip its done. game over.	&&&
I have twins and started off using ordinary wipes on both of them. One was fine, but the other got a horrible diaper rash. We tried different creams and they didn't help at all. Then we tried these sensitive wipes and her rash went away, but when we ran out and got ordinary wipes, her rash was back! I then realized that it was the sensitive wipes that helped and switched back to them. She NEVER got a diaper rash again! I refuse to buy anything but these!	&&&
These wipes are awesome. I have always used walmart parents choice wipes but am going to start purchasing these from now on. Thanks amazon for such an awesome bargain!!!!	&&&
Only wipes that don't irritate my lil one. My other baby was the same!	&&&
We love these wipes! My baby has extremely sensitive skin and eczema, so Huggies wipes made her red and irritated. We've had no problems with these wipes and absolutely love them. Highly recommend, especially for your lo with sensitive skin!	&&&
These are great for everyday wipes around the house. As for baby needs, they rip when you need them the most so I stick to pampers.	&&&
"My wife love the fact that the wipes work so well
It stayed finger print free for a long time before
She used it again thanks"	&&&
I do not understand why women put their children into dangers by using harshlly chemicals when it is so easy to make your own baby wipes with just water+baby soap+baby oil and that's it ; it will cost you $.50 a batch and beein 100% natural and safe for the baby....	&&&
I've been using these wipes for 2 years now... they are the best! Perfect combination of strength and softness and not too wet like some other brands. Price is also competitive. Highly recommend!	&&&
Good quality. Moist, wet, and wipes butts, what more do you want from a diaper wipe? Mission accomplished.	&&&
These wipes are SUPER soft and my kid likes them. She actually asks for them specifically if she's got a diaper rash. The only issue is that the package is big and therefore heavy if you want to toss it in a diaper bag and go. The dispenser opening will come unstuck from the package after a while but overall they're great quality. These have little textured circles which make them clean better than a regular "flat" wipe.	&&&
These boogie wipes does exactly what we expected. Our baby had a cold with running nose, we are not afraid to use these to wipe her nose. Saline is what is needed every time your baby has running/stuffy nose. The wipe helps moisturizes their nose without any medicine or harsh chemicals.	&&&
Simply the best quality, softest wipes for sensitive bottoms. I've been using them for 8 years (started when my first son was born) and I foresee using them for many more. (I still use them to wipe my 4 year old's bottom). But, you can use them for so many things and they are so gentle!	&&&
I highly recommend these Boogie Wipes, the unscented is my preferred choice over the grape scented ones. It sooo gentle on my baby's nose- even better than Kleenex or wet Bounty, It may be a bit on the expensive side but it is worth it, so far for this past fall/spring season we have used at least 9 packs if not more.	&&&
"I usually buy Huggies wipes for my son, but I was offered to try these, and I don't think I can say enough good things about them. First of all, I absolutely love the packaging. The whole box was bright colors, and on the inside flaps, there's a little feeding and changing schedule to help you keep track of things and a space for notes. The packages of wipes themselves are cute prints also. The wipes work awesome, and they're almost twice the size of regular wipes, which is fantastic when you're wrestling with a 1 year old. ;-) The ONLY thing I wasn't too fond of, was the scent, or lack there of. I prefer there to be a light clean scent, but these don't have any. I will be looking to see if they come with a light scent because then I will absolutely change which brand I buy. I think these are a fantastic product.

I received this product at a deep discount in return for my honest review. The purchase price does not have an impact on my opinion."	&&&
Awesome warmer! I hate startling babies with cold wipes! This is a must for baby's comfort. Works wonderfully, and diaper changes are a much better experience for the little ones! Holds plenty of wipes, so yo are not constantly adding wipes to stay warm, even with frequent diaper changes.	&&&
Great for kids! I love how I can use these wipes on my kids hands AND face if needed. I know that it is killing germs I want off my toddlers hand but not afraid of any harmful things it could do to them with chemicals! Win all around	&&&
Great price, but somewhat dry compared to other wipes.	&&&
The wipes are thick, soft and gently on my baby's skin.	&&&
These wipes are so gentle on my grandbabies' bottom, I used them to remove my eye makeup with no irritation at all!!	&&&
"I do not have a baby, but I still have a need for baby wipes quite often. I have a 5 year old boy and a 7 year old boy. And boy do they get dirty, especially now that the weather is getting nice and they are playing outside more often. Sometimes a washcloth is not easily accessible, so wipes work wonders to do a quick face wipe or to clean their hands. Also, my 5 year old sometimes has issues (still..ugh) with wiping his butt after a bowel movement, so wipes come in handy to help him out with that. I think he actually prefers a wipe instead of toilet paper, to be honest. I also like to have wipes around for other miscellaneous reasons. You never know when they can come in handy. Anyway, when I was able to snag these wipes for an excellent deal, I couldn't pass it up. When they came, I was happy about the little clutch that comes as a bonus in the box. That will be handy for taking a few wipes in the car. Also in the box, was 8 packages of wipes with 80 wipes in each package. The packages each have a resealable â??lidâ??, which is just a piece of plastic material with adhesive that is intended to stick to the package and keep the air out of the package in order to keep the wipes moist. When I took out the first wipe out of the first package, I was highly impressed. These wipes are pretty big...bigger than most other wipes. They also are really strong and they smell nice. But my favorite features of these wipes is how soft they are. I really wish I had found these when my boys were babies because I know these wipes would have been the most gentle on their little behinds. Well, I guess I still have my 5 year old needing them for his behind on occasion, so I guess that still applies. Haha! These wipes, though, are seriously the best wipes I've ever used. I love them! They are gentle enough for a baby's bottom, but tough enough to clean up dirty little hands. I would definitely recommend these to anyone!

**Disclaimer**....I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
i love huggies wipes. they are the only brand all of my girls can use without an allergic reaction	&&&
I love these wipes! I have one colour that I can never get off with normal makeup remover and the wipe got it right off! And the wipes don't taste bad like other wipes that I have used - they are slightly sweet with a subtle fruity scent. These wipes are definitely a new staple for my makeup bag - I'll be buying the 30 pack when they are in stock!	&&&
Works great. We have auto ship to daughter for our Grandson	&&&
great for puppy, poodle wipes, does not affect our dog in any way.....saves a trip to pet mart = save time, money, gas	&&&
these work great. i go over everything when im done cleaning to disinfect my kitchen. it gets the grease off my stove too. no struggle it just wipes right off.	&&&
I really enjoy these wipes! They never broke out my sensitive skin but still managed to get off all my makeup (even the eyes with no hint of redness). Although these can be a little pricey they are far less so than most other brands, and I often find coupons floating around for Simple products. Plus, they smell great !	&&&
Very good I also use it on my TV."}}];	&&&
I received the Pampers baby fresh wipes as a gift when our little one came home from the hospital. I love how soft and gentle they are for my newborn. I've used other economy wipes and was not satisfied. I will definitely continue to buy the baby fresh wipes. It's worth the extra money you spend for a high quality product and the comfort of your baby!	&&&
Mom of 2! love caring these in my purse. love the smell. These babies come in handy :)	&&&
Great scent, soft. Perfect for wiping my toddlers nose and face after meals or runny nose	&&&
I am beyond disappointed with this product. They have an extremely strong scent, which doesnot work well on sensitive skin. As these are advertised as "gentle" this should not be an issue. However, beyond the scent, these wipes burn as soon as you get them near your eyes and leave a terribly disgusting film all over the face. Don't waste your money on these!	&&&
You cant say much about wipes, but I love the smell of these wipes. I recently bought this case for a friend, and she absolutely loved it. I use Huggies Natural Care baby wipes in my own home, and I do have a slight problem with them. They seem to be too moist. So wet that sometimes they will leave your baby feeling wet and if you squeeze the wipe before using you can see water pour from it. Other than that, these smell and work amazing.	&&&
The wipe containers make it difficult to remove just one wipe but otherwise this is a great product.	&&&
I have been using these wipes since day one on my little one, with the occasional use of other Pampers wipes, but these are by far my favorite and the only wipe that my little ones "bum" can handle.	&&&
These wipes are a must have for mommies to carry around. I prefer these over the travel pack with 20 wipes. With these, you never get a dry wipe. These make cleaning toddler hands easy when you are on the go.	&&&
Clorox wipes are great for at home and at work! We use these in our eye care office to sanitize every night after patients are done.	&&&
These wipes are great. They are very thick so I find I use less and they last me so much longer than the other brands out there. Also great for sensitive bums	&&&
These wipes is something that everyone needs in there homes cars wherever. They are affordable to so that makes it even better.	&&&
Gentle on my son's skin. Not to wet and not too dry.	&&&
Been trying these out for the past few days. I like their size and scent, and they don't leave my face oily or filmy. I'm not sure they totally take off all my eye makeup, because I still need to use an eye makeup remover for my eyeliner.	&&&
Our son has sensitive skin and had diaper rash constantly when he was first born. It was so bad that when he was in the NICU they had to use special prescription stuff and started using gauze with only water. We used gauze for a while but its crazy expensive. Then we tried the other "natural" wipes out there (7th gen, etc.), and he got diaper rash with all of them. Enter Water Wipes - these have been great. Yeah, they are more expensive than regular wipes, but they are cheaper than gauze. Plus, happy baby and happy baby butt are totally worth it. Excellent product.	&&&
Very dry wipes. DO NOT BUY	&&&
I lovve these wipes,and this brand! never gave my kids rushes and don't have too much of a fragrance!	&&&
Bought these Simple face wipes and Im hooked. They aren't harsh on my skin and they remove makeup!	&&&
This might be my favorite product from Yes To. These wipes seriously leave my face feeling so refreshed. They take off almost all of my makeup including hard to remove mascara, etc.	&&&
Comparable to Pampers wipes. I prefer Kirkland brand (Costco) or huggies. They work ok but probably wont buy again.	&&&
I found that these are not very easy to use and do not seem to retain moisture once you open the pack. Overall they were not my favorite wipes and did not function as well as other varieties. They did not have much scent if any and were pretty soft, but just did not do a good job for cleaning overall in my opinion.	&&&
Ive tried many makeup remover wipes/ products... and many of them would leave my face extra dry, extra oily, it would burn my skin, didnt even take off my make up and leave me rashes! :/ But ever since i discovered Aveeno makeup remover wipes, I actually love how it works on my skin and how it takes off all my makeup! its PERFECT for my sensitive skin!	&&&
I use Clorox disinfecting wipes all the time! With kids in the house they become a necessity to not only clean up messes but to keep the nasty germs from spreading!	&&&
Definitely a must as far as cleaning supplies to have around the house! I use these wipes everywhere from my kitchen counters to my bathroom sinks!	&&&
Don't even think about paying this much. This is a Walmart product and costs $3.97. They are great flushable wipes.	&&&
The ULTIMATE BEST wipes in the world!! Smells 100% of Coconut and leaves skin super soft!!!	&&&
With three boys it's hard to clean everyday. So I have stock it seems like with these wipes. I use them For the bathroom, counters and doors. They are the best and can be used without wetting down the surface after use	&&&
These worked well and with the discount even better they are wipes guys that clean messes I don't like spending a fortune on name brands but also need them sturdy enough to clean up well I feel these did just that .	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes. I was given wipes for my shower from another retailer, the stores brand, and for every one huggies wipe I had to use four of t he store brand ones. So they are more expensive than the retailers "house brand," especially with a recent price hike, but will still buy for now.	&&&
I love these wipes! I recently ran out and tried to use paper towels and a spray cleaner to clean my countertops. Never again! I ran to the store to get more because you could hardly tell that my counter was even cleaned. I love that they scrub and disinfect too.	&&&
Huggies wipes are the best. I used them for my kids and now my grand kids. I like to keep them in my car for my own personal use. They are very durable and don't dry out fast like some brands. I just tried the natural brand for the first time (Love It).	&&&
As an electrologist, I like to keep my treatment area as disinfected as possible. These wipes kill everything and a single wipe is enough to wipe down all of the equipment that needs sanitizing after working on someone.	&&&
These are the best things ever! I use them after my daughter makes a mess on her highchair. They clean it up and also are easy to use but also disinfects.	&&&
These wipes are so strong! the can tackle some very tough messes :)	&&&
i love huggies wipes. only brand i would buy the fact that every other brand will have wipes that have no scent. best smelling wipes ever .	&&&
Big generous wipes Do a good job. I've used these for years.	&&&
I like these simple face wipes a lot!I like the fact that these face wipes are made from mostly natural ingredients so that's a plus too!	&&&
my favorite wipes and perfect for my toddlers sensitive skin!	&&&
Good wipes that work well at cleaning my glasses. They do leave a little bit of gunk on them after the first cleaning but I think that's just accumulated oils/soap that were on the lenses. After a second cleaning the glasses are as good as new.	&&&
I use Pampers sensitive on my baby because he has eczema. It is superior to other brands that are over perfumed or super thin. The only problem is the packages have less wipes than the regular wipes	&&&
I love buggies baby wipes and diapers. They are a great product. I recommend everyone with a baby to use this product	&&&
I use these wipes to clean my kitchen counter---my pussycat climbs up there and leaves her muddy paw prints---and of course there are the usual food spills. The container is well designed: individual wipes are easy to pull out. They don't stick together like many other brands. And the linen fragrance is a nice fresh change.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wet Wipes are great and helpful for me. When ever I see a stain on the wall or drawer I clean and disinfect anything with clorox wipes.	&&&
I hate how thin these wipes are. I have to use 2 at once to keep my hand from smelling like poop. It's gross. Yes I wash my hands when I'm done, but the smell is definitely there.	&&&
These wipes are really great. My son loves them. They are so gentle. He even uses them to clean his hands and face. He doesn't like to get dirty so when we are out i can hand him a wipe and he is so happy.	&&&
I use these to wipe down everything when I'm pumping. Given that they're wipes, they're very effective at that. The small travel pouches make them easy to toss into the pump bag and make sure I can keep everything clean during the day.	&&&
New mom here! I did a little research prior to buying these. So far buti-pods have not disappointed. The size saves space in a diaper bag. It saves money - because you can use any wipe in them, and it keeps wipes moist, AND only dispenses one wipe at a time - unlike most travel size wipe packages.	&&&
These facial cleaning cloths really do leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth. When I'm too lazy to do the whole soap & water thing, I'll grab one of these. I'm also going to throw a pack in our camping gear for night (and morning) cleanings rather than using baby wipes.	&&&
LOVE Pampers wipes! Soft, perfect size, perfect moistness, and great scent! Only wipe to use!	&&&
We used these wipes on our son since he was born and never a problem with skin irritations like we had with other comparable products. Liked them so much, we still order them 4 yrs later for quick and easy cleanups at home, car and travel.	&&&
This Clorox wipes are the best. I use them when I get to class to wipe my table clean, when in the bathroom and also in the kitchen	&&&
We always have our house stocked with lysol wipes! Never have we not had them. They help hold counters, doors, knobs etc over until we're able to give them all a thorough scrub down.	&&&
I love these! I received these as a gift at my baby shower and thought they were hilarious. But, once my daughter was born, they became a life saver! The smell fresh and no harsh chemicals that I would be worried about near my daughter!	&&&
Love these wipes- they are so handy and convenient! I would give them all 5 stars except I get a better deal with the Lysol wipes that do the same thing, but have a less-strong smell and you get more wipes in a package with Lysol than with Clorox. However, I can trust in both brands that they are family friendly and really work.	&&&
Good wipes - cleans well.	&&&
Loved the wipes , very useful ! Especially when your out in public on a monthly and you just really need to refresh yourself .	&&&
Refreshing and leaves my face clean, My favorite makeup remover wipes.	&&&
Like many other reviewers, I loved these wipes until they changed them completely! I had been using these wipes exclusively for almost four years - through 2 kids - and was very happy. I was shocked and disappointed when my last subscribe and save package came and I found the they were completely different wipes. The size (smaller), texture (rougher), and composition (drier) had all changed for the worse and I find that it takes 3-4 wipes to do the job of 1 of the old ones. Very disappointed!	&&&
"These are pretty good baby wipes! I ordered them in a count of six because it seems to be cheaper that way. The wipes are thick, have no scent, and are very moist. I do like that they have ridges and a pattern on them because I think that makes them that much more effective. The wipes are moist enough to take care of everything when my daughter goes number two. They are not so moist that they do not readily dry after wiping.

The flip top on the wipes package closes very easily, and has a very clear label on the front. When I was ordering the wipes, at first I though they were all the same listing. I then noticed that the color/label of the wipes on the top is what deciphers them. I felt like this was kind of confusing. As a mom on the go, I think that if I was just going on to order wipes, I may possibly order the wrong ones. Maybe if the package was more of that same flip top color, it would be a little bit easier to identify.

I used these wipes on myself to take my makeup off, and no irritation and no issues! I have tried other store brand and private brand wipes and have gotten some irritation on my eyes. So much irritation that it caused my eyes to puff up! I did not have that problem here.

Another aspect of these wipes that I do not quite favor, is there is almost a half fold on the wipes. So when I take one wipe out of the package, the next one almost always comes out, and I have to shove it back in. I do not typically have this problem with the other brand of wipes. I think they could be folded over in each other less, and they wont come out like that. I hate the thought of taking the wipes because I need them, dirty hands, and then shoving a CLEAN one back inside and possibly dirtying it--just seems unsanitary to me. Other than that, I think the quality of the wipes is really good!! Surprising, but I do like them!"	&&&
"I love these baby wipes! Bloom +KIND Jumbo Sensitive Baby Wipes are unscented and hypoallergenic, making them safe for all skin types. I like the fact that there's NO alcohol, so they aren't irritating to the skin.

The wipes are a good size, larger than most wipes. They're made of a thick, stretchy material and are very soft and cloth-like. This is a huge box of (8) packages of 80 wipes each, for a total of 640 wipes. That's a whole lot of wiping, folks!

Although these are made for babies, I use these in my art studio for removing paint from my hands and miscellaneous paint splatters on my art table. They work beautifully for my needs, without drying out my hands. I also keep a package by the front door to wipe dirty paws. These wipes are large enough and strong enough to withstand my 130 pound chocolate lab's gigantic paws.

Far too many products these days are made outside the country, so knowing this product is made in the U.S.A. is two thumbs up for me!

I received these at a discount for testing purposes, and for my honest and unbiased review. I highly recommend these baby wipes."	&&&
Love these wipes, great to have a bunch on hand	&&&
"I was so excited to get these baby wipes in the mail.

These wipes are strong, moisturizing, and gentle for cleaning baby.I am glad the ingredients in the wipes are good for my baby and I don't have to worry about putting tons of chemicals on their skin.It says it has 98% natural ingredients in it.From what I can tell, the 2 percent that is not natural is the Phenoxyethanol which is an Antimicrobial Agent

My baby girl has very sensitive skin and I have had a hard time finding baby wipes sensitive enough for her.She gets rashes easily and it is nice to know that there is a better solution to using chemical filled baby wipes.Usually my little girl will get a rash after the first time of use using a wipe that is not sensitive enough for her.

I have been using bloom baby for a week now and have had only positive results out of using them.My baby's skin isn't dry, red, or having a rash.

Baby wipes are also great for taking makeup off.I have used these to take my makeup off and haven't experienced the drying effect like other wipes.

This is a great box of wipes.I love the jumbo size wipes and nice sized 80 count plastic disposable pouches that fit perfectly in my diper wipe container.The wipes come with a plastic pouch that fits about 40 wipes in it, so about half a plastic disposable pouch.The reusable pouch is ok.It is a little difficult to take baby wipes out of you are trying to open it with one hand.

I received this product to review for free for my honest and unbiased opinion.All views in this review are completely my own.

My oldest son is 16 years old I used this product since he born. The best baby wipes ever	&&&
I use these wipes to remove my eye make-up. They are so soft & gentle, it doesn't feel like I'm ripping my eyelashes out. Very effective on getting my mascara off.	&&&
These wipes are gentle, soft, have a refreshing scent!	&&&
Great wipes, keeps my skin clear and looking fresh. Only draw back is they are expensive.	&&&
This is a really nice and convenient wipes dispenser. It let's us pull out just a single wipe every time. It's so easy and convenient. And...MY WIFE LOVES IT.	&&&
Wipes are very slippery. Don't have much grip or grooves when wipes against the baby's skin.	&&&
Great wipes. I have nothing to add.	&&&
We first bought these for our newborn but we prefer Huggies wipes over these. They are not nearly as efficient as Huggies.	&&&
"Two things I wondered about these wipes before using them: do they stink, and do they work?

They definitely have a distinct scent, but it is not overpowering or sour like apple cider vinegar. It's more of a flural scent with a slightly pungent vinegar undertone. I find it pleasant enough, and once your face dries you can't smell it anyway!

I mostly bought these to use on my 7 year old. She is a heavy sweater when she sleeps, and it has caused break outs around her hairline (and occasionally on other parts of her face) that haven't gone away with just a wet cloth. I'm hesitant to use soap or an adult face wash on such young skin, considering I use nothing but water on my own face! These were available for a promotion so I figured it was worth a shot. I feel comfortable with all the natural ingredients and am pleased with the convenience of a daily packet. I've been having my daughter use a wipe in the morning and a wet wash cloth at night for almost two weeks now. Her forehead has cleared up all the way and she's had no new pimples on the rest of her face or blackheads on her nose. I tried a wipe on myself and it feels really cool and refreshing without that gross tight skin feeling. I think they probably work better than ACV alone, and because I'm too lazy to mix the other helpful ingredients together myself, I'd say the convenience alone is worth it! I will probably buy these again in the future.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review here."	&&&
"I've been using water wipes pretty much exclusively for the past 8 months and just got my first box of Blooms. Omg I love these!! They're thicker and larger. Feel much softer and usually only need one to do the job. I use them all over the house. Especially love having them near my twins highchairs for quick cleanups. I'm very happy to have found these and will be purchasing again.

I received these wipes at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts expressed are solely my own."	&&&
I bought these awhile and forgot to review. But my thoughts were that I did like them. Scent is awesome. They did feel a slight "irritation" but not bad. They did remove eye makeup okay but I feel like wipes are never a great full cleanse but in a rush, I love them.	&&&
Love these wipes -- soft and gentle on my baby's skin.	&&&
"These are not only great for babies but great for adults as well. I have been using wipes for about a year after I found out that some toilet paper I am allergic too, so I decided to start using unscented wipes. These are way better than some of the wipes that I usually buy, They are thick and they really are jumbo wipes compared to other wipes. You can actually fold these without getting anything on your hands or using a ton of wipes. I do not like the smell of these wipes that much even though they are unscented, I cant really figure out what they smell like, but it is not a good or bad smell in my opinion. I love how colorful and fun the packaging is and it comes with a carrying case which is great. I would recommend these wipes to my aunt for her baby since he has eczema and every little thing irritates his skin.

NOTE: I received this product for a discount or free for my honest review."	&&&
Great wipes that make your face feel awesome.	&&&
I love huggies wipes.	&&&
I have used Seventh Generation wipes in the past for myself on an overseas vacation - they're easy for face wipes, hand wipes, body wipes when you are busy exploring! I have recently used them again for their intended purpose and they work well. I only wish there were even fewer ingredients. I usually use cloth diapers and wipes, but use disposable wipes on the go and these are the most widely available natural-ish ones that work.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
These are the only wipes I use for both my babies. Gentle, soft, and gets the job done without having to use multiple wipes!	&&&
We have an 5 month old infant and we have tested just about every brand of natural and sensitive baby wipe to find the best product for our baby. We had settled on a popular brand of sensitives until i tried Bloom. Bloom Wipes are sensitive yet durable. They have a pleasant smell and they are a overall great product. I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review. If your struggleing with finding something that is safe for baby and can help prevent rashes then this baby wipes is a must. These are the best baby wipes we ever used!	&&&
"These face towelettes are very handy! I really enjoy using them at night. My skin routine was several steps before I tried these, and it was sometimes daunting to even want to clean my face when I was especially tired. I am pregnant and dealing with some acne as a result of the pregnancy, which is why I wanted to try these. I had concerns because I have extremely dry skin that these would just dry my face out more, but instead, it cleared up my acne and did not dry my skin out. I really like the results of these face wipes. I am rating it a 4-star instead of a 5 because I had a difficult time with the smell. It is not a strong smell, but the faint smell of apple cider vinegar was unsettling to me in my pregnant state. Also, I found that I still have to use a moisturizer with it, and I was hoping for something that would be a one-wipe solution.

Pros: Great for acne, Doesn't dry skin out, simple and easy!
Cons: faint smell, still need a moisturizing step

I purchased this product at a discount with the promise of giving an honest and unbiased opinion."	&&&
These are the worst wipes I have tried. They are hard and rough and my 2 year old child even complained about them being hard. What is worse is that I bought a 3-pack of them so I am stuck with a bunch of useless wipes.	&&&
These are by far my favorite baby wipes. The smell is amazing, and it seems to work better than other wipes I've tried. Nice and thick, and feels like it's doing a better job cleaning. I highly recommend these wipes if you don't mind the price tag -- at least try them once. Buying in bulk helps, and if you do the 'subscribe & save' option, you can still cancel anytime (or push back the delivery date if you only want to splurge a couple times a year -- that's what I do).	&&&
These wipes are excellent. They are a perfect thickness, have a little bit of texture to help clean messes, and are not so watery to keep everything together.	&&&
When my son was an infant, my husband and I travelled a lot. I used to take these wipes wherever we travelled. I knew they were safe for my baby.	&&&
When I notice my monitor is getting dirty, the wipes clean off the smudges. So I am happy with this product.	&&&
so they're wipes....	&&&
I keep these in my purse to use for messes in place of baby wipes to use for non-diaper related messes. They just seem to be better to wipe a face with than using what you wipe your baby's butt with!	&&&
my Lo goes very regularly wipes are very gentle and clean .price is a bargain	&&&
Last 1/4 of package, the wipes are soaking wet! But otherwise fine.	&&&
These are heavy duty wipes they don't break when you wipe and are natural! I use these on my dogs they are awesome! Have been buying them for a while now and will continue to AND the price is good!	&&&
The wipes are really good about getting off stubborn makeup, probably the best makeup wipes that I've found so far.	&&&
It's just a fancy plastic box for wipes. Not a wipe warmer.	&&&
I love to have a stock pile when it comes to diapers, wipes and other baby items. I did the math and, in the long run, this box will save you money. I love this!	&&&
i purchased these at the W store today. for someone who has sensitive and VERY dry skin, these aren't bad! i like that you can use them for wiping your arms and hands also. great in the summer...if it gets here! i will use them at night with my Retinol cream. i'll also put a few in a baggie if i'll be gone for the day. make-up for me is mascara(2 swipes) and a little blush and lip gloss...so it takes it all off. i think its a good product and i like that you get 30 and not 25 wipes.	&&&
As expected the wipes are great for cleaning screens for basically any electronic device and the spray duster removed a lot of gunk out from laptop keyboard and made it feel brand new	&&&
I received these in my influester box and my opinion is abs free. I love this wipes. They smell like their package describes but they aren't over powering. I like to use these on days when I go to the gym and have errands to do right after before I head home. Makes me feel clean and refreshed. They are individually packed which I love because I put them in all in bags just in case I ever feel like I need to freshen up.	&&&
love these wipes they are awesome. My little one was born early and has sensitive skin so we use the sensitive wipes are unscented and great for her skin. Never had any issues with these and anyone with a baby with sensitive skin should use these. I like them better then Huggies, since they have a texture to them and these ones do not, they are soft and silky.	&&&
"Very handy! I love that we can have these wherever we need them, in the car, diaper bag, out in the boat.... But, they do have an odd odor. I can't put my finger on it as to what it is. We've used unscented wipes in the past, but these have something that just makes them smell a bit.

Other than that, they are a good size, and are durable when needing to scrub little (and big) hands and faces when they get dirty!!"	&&&
These are great to use on any surface to kill germs. I use these in the school I work at since kids touch everything.	&&&
not fancy, just wipes.	&&&
Like these a lot, use them to wipe down the kitchen cabinets and the bathroom in between deep cleaning. They smell good but not too strong, they help remove stains from my white cabinets.	&&&
I have 4 kids and have tried all kinds of wipes and I always come back to these. Love how soft they are.	&&&
As described	&&&
I LOVE these baby wipes. They are super soft but durable and will not irritate your baby's skin. They are probably the closest thing to a wash cloth in a traditional baby wipe form. That said, I recommend buying a separate wipes holder and travel case for your diaper bag because the packaging itself is not that conducive to pulling out wipes.	&&&
These are great for cleaning up the kitchen after a long day of cooking! The kitchen ends up smelling great and I feel confidant that all the surfaces are clean and safe!	&&&
My bathroom is not complete without Cottonelle Fresh Wipes. Soft, refreshing, and 100% flushable.	&&&
I love the Huggies brand diapers and their wipes are no different. Love them! I have used them with all my kids and am already stocked up for baby Linda due next week.They are durable and don't leave anything behind.	&&&
This case is not practical if you don't use it very often. As I put wipes in the case for the first time I noticed that it doesn't close very well but instead has gaps along the sides. After having the wipes dry out quickly the first time I taped the sides once refilling it with wet wipes. A few weeks later the wipes are dry again. I am disappointed since the dispenser closes very well. If you're not going to use the wipes on a daily basis then skip this case.	&&&
"Huggies wipes are the best baby wipes! I realized after many diaper changes that I didn't actually need a whole wipe to clean such a tiny area so I started tearing them into strips of 3 or 4. Here are the pros and cons as compared to Pampers wipes:

Pros:
Easily tear into strips so you can get much more for your money. (Pampers don't tear very easily)
Feed chute where wipe comes out works much better; the previous wipe almost always comes up without dropping the next wipe.
Leave your baby feeling clean rather than slightly slippery with Pampers wipes.
Container is better at keeping wipes moist, especially if you accidentally leave it open.

Cons:
I never find coupons for free wipes, whereas I keep getting free Pampers wipes.

If you found any of the considerations in this review helpful, please vote for this review."	&&&
since your wife won't let you bring the hose in the house ..	&&&
I like how thick Huggies wipes are but I couldnt use them as they gave all three of my children rashes..	&&&
I don't use these as diaper wipes, I use them as burp cloths. I never leave home without a few in my pocket or in the diaper bag. The fabric is soft & you can reuse them over & over. I just throw them in the laundry when they've been used a time or 2. I don't know what I would have done without these! A must-have!	&&&
I had been using Huggies Natural Care Wipes for a while (after hating the Pampers sensitive wipes for their slimy texture) and decided to test these on my last Subscribe & Save order. Other than the obvious difference based on the name alone, I was surprised to find the quality of the wipe also lacking. They are definitely not as thick or "durable" as the Huggies Natural Care wipes. It's like they shred or come a part when in use... even my husband noticed a change in the quality of the wipes. The wipe itself is still intact, but I find myself picking off little pieces every time.. not so "simply clean." It's tedious and frustrating, especially with a wiggly 6 month old trying to escape! For the price difference, I'm switching back to the Natural Care wipes.	&&&
Love huggies wipes, strong, and does the job. The cucumber smell rocks	&&&
Nothing cleans glasses like these do!	&&&
overall i really like these wipes they smell good like really clean and they are very well at cleaning some not so nice solid diaper issues. my only problem with this product is that i have a squirmy toddler that doesnt like to sit still nothing really helps but just trying to rush through it with everything clean and sometime accidents will happen when im changing him or trying toget a wipe out that it will rip or my fingure with rip through it during the process of changing and its kinda gross and kinda a time wast having to finish cleanig up and thats my overall review of this product. so its pretty great just not very durable during wiping little bums.	&&&
These wipes are large enough for 2 to use when you need a little cleanup or disinfect your hand. Sam's used to have them in club now it is online only, to bad they would sell more.	&&&
Wipes are wipes, yes? Kindof. Anyone who has ever been gifted the "cheap" wipes (think dollar store) can tell you that is not true. When you're cleaning up poop, you need quality at your fingertips or something else will be all over your fingertips. Yes, GROSS. Do yourself a favor and don't skimp on baby wipes. This is one thing you need to splurge on. Huggies wipes for the win.	&&&
Great product.	&&&
Great value. Great product	&&&
The wipes were dry as an old newspaper.	&&&
It seems like they changed the wipe a bit. Now it's a smoother wipe (which doesn't seem to clean as well) and not as moist. I still like that it doesn't contain added toxins that other wipes have.	&&&
Work well, very useful!	&&&
I keep these in the baby's room, all bathrooms, kitchen and car! The whole family uses them for many uses! They are soft and sensitive for my sons little sensitive bottom as well as for our faces on a hot day or after eating sticky fruit a great quick clean up on the go!	&&&
I got a sample of this and the first thing I thought was wow they're thicker and better quality wipes than most makeup wipes, it smells decent and its really moist so it will take off most makeup. It took all of my makeup off and I was quite pleased. I have sensitive skin and it didn't give me reactions either.	&&&
Works well and non-toxic!	&&&
These are a great purchase and came very quickly. My son has very sensitive skin and was a little worried about them being scented but they don't bother his skin.	&&&
"I absolutely love these wipes, this are my favorites by far. They have no fragrance which is important to me and they are strong enough to clean up mess but still really soft and gentle with my baby's skin.
Plus, huggies has a lots of promotion on this very often."	&&&
Great for travel. Holds about half a packet of wet wipes.	&&&
We are very happy with these wipes! I like how they are pakaged as opposed to other bags of wipes. They are a good weight and work well. I just wish the price was a little bit better.	&&&
I am not happy with these wipes! they are made of a slippery material unlike any BABY wipe I have tried before. It takes 5-6 of these to clean up my 1 yr. olds poopy bottom. They just won't stay flat when you wipe, they roll up and do not clean well at all. To me they are more like hand wipes that I use in the car.	&&&
Use these all the time on our glasses and to clean screens on our cell phones.	&&&
These baby wipes are so soft, they clean very well.	&&&
The fresh clean smell of clorox wipes is amazing. I keep them in the bathroom, kitchen and even at my desk. I feel like it really helps keep down germs, especially when there is a sickness going around.	&&&
These wipes work pretty good. The only complaint I have is that when you try to take them out of the wipes holder they sometimes will rip and tear into pieces.	&&&
I love these wipes! They clean well and have a clean scent which I love. I recommend this product to anyone.	&&&
Love this product! I use it mutiple times per week in my house. Anywhere from the kitchen counters, children's toys to the bathroom! I really feel like they disinfect everything and things feel clean after using Clorox wipes! Definitely a must in our home!	&&&
These wipes are very good quality. We are a family that prefers pampers over huggies and I have to say I wouldn't mind replacing all my wipes with Amazon! Once I need more, I will be a repeat customer. Thank you.	&&&
These are so much easier to order in advance or even sign up for automatic delivery because we go through them so fast. My daughter has never had an issue with these sensitive wipes. She has never broken out or had any negative reactions from them.	&&&
They shrunk after a wash, in cold water.... Very annoying.	&&&
These wipes are so refreshing. I like to use them in the morning before applying my make up to give myself a fresh clean start.	&&&
I love these wipes. They have great value and but most of all they are thick and soft. The last thing you need or want at 3am is for your finger to bust through a cheap, thin wipe!	&&&
I love these wipes but the only downside is the price. Luckily many stores have their own versions of these cucumber wipes for sensitive skin.	&&&
Love these wipes they get the job done! Our baby is allergic to everything but these!	&&&
These are nice and they work. I just don't care for the way they smell. I love the fresh scent puppy wipes.	&&&
The economy pack of these wipes is a great value compared to the alternatives, and these are very valuable when you have a person that has a compromised immune system and must clean up in the course of everyday life. Great purchase, great value, and great product.	&&&
These wipes work wonderfully. They are far superior than other brands I have tried.	&&&
I would like these more if they were not so dang expensive! I also would love these more if they weren't so flimsy. They do their job, wipe grime and germs off my baby's hand pretty well, but tend to be difficult to open once out of the packaging and an awkward size. it would be better if they made the wipe a large square instead of a rectangle as it would be easier to wipe a baby/toddler's hands with it that way. In any event, I like that there is no harsh alcohol in the wipes. They work well and do not irritate my daughter's very sensitive skin.	&&&
Huggies are our preferred brand of wipes and these soft packs are handy for having in the diaper bag	&&&
These wipes are wonderful! After our pediatrician recommended using just washcloths and water for diaper rash, I was thrilled to find these as we were doing laundry every two seconds. These worked great and we are still using them.	&&&
great wipes and great quality and great price	&&&
It was not until a friend introduced me to the Kirkland's wipes (by gifting them to me) that I agreed to try these wipes...wow! These are much more effective and less costly. They don't fall apart or tear when you are getting them out of the container. They have traction to wipe up messes. Bravo!! This is a keeper!	&&&
I love this product. It would be much cheaper just to buy the spray bottle and some rags; however this is so convinient. I cannot help but use this product daily. It is fast and efficient. It is worth paying a little more for those that do not have a lot of time on their hands. I am always rushing in and out of the kitchen, home, etc. and this is great to just wipe and go. When you have the time definitely spare these wipes for a time when you really need them and use a spray bottle. These are on the pricey end and I am all for saving money and time.	&&&
Great Wipes!	&&&
I love these face wipes! I have very dry skin, and they do not dry out my skin one bit! I use these in the morning right before I do my makeup! These wipes work the best on my skin!	&&&
I miss the big bag of wipes but this is a good substitute. Work great.	&&&
Great wipes for everything.	&&&
working well for us so far. feels quite humane to use warm wipes on baby's bum. i am using distilled water (most of the time), and I do take care to keep the pad at the bottom wet. I also have it sitting on a towel on the top of the baby's dresser so that rogue water doesn't damage the surface of the dresser.	&&&
Great price, great product.	&&&
We love these wipes and I love being able to just order re-fills when we are getting low. For us these have been the best wipes- mostly because the wipes don't instantly rip apart when you use them to wipe (like quite a few other brands/store brands). I wasn't sure this pack would come with a plastic tub (because I've seen reviews say it does and does not come with one) but ours included three bags of wipes (624 ct.) and a little tub. They work well, are a decent price, and they don't irritate my daughter's skin and for wipes that's all you need.	&&&
Not in a plastic container with a hard lid which I thought when I purchased these wipes	&&&
I love these wipes. I have used them for years, long before I got pregnant. I am a little bit of a neat freak and so I would carry them around and use them if my hands got dirty, greasy, etc. What is great with these is they do not dry your skin out like some other wipes do, they don't pill as much as some and they are super soft.	&&&
This product has a very nice new car smell as promised. The wipes do not offer an advantage over the type of liquid that comes in container because one needs a regular towel anyway to wipe off your hands. I am not a big fan of this style of product (with the wipes). Another downside is that in hot weather, I would think these towels would dry out kept in the vehicle which I like to do. For those of you who like this style of product, this format will work. I think the new car aroma is pretty good with this product so I am giving the product 4 stars.	&&&
I don't have a baby, pacifiers, or a pump. Why did I by these, you might ask? I was actually bought these wipes to clean my coffe mug. I work in an office without a kitchen skin and I don't have a place to store things like dish soap or a sponge. These are fantastic for getting off dried on coffee and tea stains. They also do not leave behind any smells or tastes!	&&&
This is my second purchase. I wish I had bought these wipes a long time ago. Not only do they save me money, they're uber absorbant and I only need two (maybe three) per dirty diaper!	&&&
Love clorox wipes! I use them for everything love how they can be used for almost anything they wipe up everything and disinfect at the same time! Always have a to go pack on me	&&&
I bought these wipes because my kidlet wants to cut all his teeth at once and, besides this, apparently aspires to become a major league baseball player. As you can imagine, this isn't a good combination if you want to stay clean and healthy. Anyway, I read the reviews about the smell, but I thought maybe everybody just didn't like the scent, and since I love thyme, I didn't think I'd mind it. Well, the scent isn't exactly my favorite, but the problem is that it's so strong it will knock you over! I decided we needed a refund, so I tried to send them back, but Amazon gave me the option to receive a refund without a return, so at least there's that. But yeah, while they might do the job, the smell can't be ignored, by anybody within a 3 mile radius.	&&&
They were fine for my sensitive skin, but they weren't very moist. Simple Facial Wipes work better for makeup removal.	&&&
Worked great on some old jewelry I received! Very happy with purchase.	&&&
"I live in a house with a whole bunch of antique crystal chandeliers (my better half has collected them over the course of twenty years or so), and cleaning them can be a pain in the neck (first world problems, I know). Usually, I use vinegar and elbow grease -- but I'm graduating from university this week, and we have a whole bunch of people convening upon us in a few short days. Having been unusually busy this past semester, I hadn't paid much attention to the cleaning, and as such I need to get the whole house sorted, STAT.

Enter Clorox Glass Wipes: I picked up a package at my local grocery store, figuring that they'd at least get the ridiculous amount of glass and crystal in the house into passable condition. I thought it might take quite a few of them to clean any one chandelier, but I was prepared for that eventuality if it made the job quicker.

I tried them on the most complex chandeliers today, and they're surprisingly effective. I had done about a quarter of the crystals with vinegar already on a chandelier that has well over a hundred of the things; I was able to finish it quite quickly with one of the wipes. That surprised me; I figured it would take a lot more. The facets look quite nice and clear, if not quite as clear as they'd look after a good going-over the old-fashioned way. I haven't noticed any film left behind, but I also haven't scrutinized them all that closely. I don't think anyone else will be scrutinizing them too closely, either, so they're probably fine.

I'll check back in on how they do on windows, the shower door, and all the ridiculous mirrored closet doors."	&&&
Excellent product!!! I enjoy cleaning with the wipes because they're easy and it makes cleaning quick. I would highly recommend them.	&&&
I always have dry skin on my face and it flakes off and looks terrible. But now I use these Simple exfoliating wipes and it takes all the dry skin off! I usually take time to cut the wipes in half because they're pretty big, so then the package lasts longer. I do the whole package at one time (one wipe at a time) so then I'm set for the month.	&&&
Really good wipes, I don't use any other brand there the only ones I like plus I like collecting the points to collect the rewards	&&&
I love the convince of these wipes. Great to be able to buy them from Amazon.	&&&
I do not like these wipes. I find they rip and stay cold. They are not very wet and it is difficult to pull out of the container	&&&
Clorox wipes are amazing. They are so convenient. I love to use them to clean my cubicle at work and also to clean my electronics. Amazing product. Highly recommend it.	&&&
I love these. I feel like these are the best bang for my buck. Excellent for my baby's sensitive skin. Very moist and soft. Not scratchy. Be sure to close the top though, like all wipes these will dry out if left open.	&&&
I love these facial wipes. I have super sensitive skin and the Simple brand never causes me to break out!! These wipes get all my makeup off, excluding waterproof mascara (which I don't wear very often). I use them almost everyday!	&&&
On our 4th baby in 7 years, so we know wipes. These are the right quality and pack size. Better quality than the generic brands which are so flimsy it can be disgusting to wipe up a messy bottom (soaks thru, breaks down too quickly, flimsy).	&&&
Very thick, soapy wipes. I think these are my favorite baby wipes.	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I tried these wipes on my little guy and they worked great on his sensitive skin. We went out and bought more!! Love these!	&&&
My son had a really stuffy nose and it was becoming raw from wiping it too frequently. The boogie wipes were great for sensitive baby skin!	&&&
loves these wipes	&&&
These are the only flushable wipes that don't irritate my son.	&&&
Best wipes to remove makeup	&&&
Didn't give my son who has a sensitive bottom a rash. The wipes were the right texture for a mess to be made easy.	&&&
Huggies wipes are just my favorite kind of wipes. The wipes have the perfect texture and grab onto the mess instead of slipping and sliding like some others do. I've used it on all my two kids and they never had any problems with it.	&&&
I am a fan of most Seventh Generation products, however, these wipes made my baby's bottom red with a small rash. I've since found a different hypoallergenic baby wipe, but was not impressed with Seventh Generation's baby products.	&&&
It's my family's number one wet wipes, because it disinfects hands and other cleaned part of the body.	&&&
So I picked this up in stores to try it out. I am an avid lover of make-up remover wipes. so easy to use and take on the go! But this product...was a nightmare. First of, let me say the the ONE good this about this product is that it smells like the ocean, and my inner mermaid loves it. However, my face, does not. The wipes are pretty small compared to others. It takes me about three wipes to remove my eye make-up, where with other brands I only need one. Instead of removing the make-up, it just kind of spreads it around my skin and I literally have to scrub to try to get the make-up off. And the "exfoliating" properies of this wipe make that twice as fun. Because I feel like I am scrubbing my eye make-up off with sandpaper. I really, very rarely have hated any beauty product, and I truly do hate these wipes. It says on the package that it is meant to remove make-up, why doesn't it do that?! I can't believe other people have rated this product so high!	&&&
I love love love these wipes, they smell exactly like my favorite candy (Cadbury Mini Eggs) and leave me feeling fresh. I love that the brand is cruelty-free and mostly natural as well. I have sensitive skin and this didn't irritate me at all. I bought the wash too, it's perfect.	&&&
Panniers wipes are all we use in this house. They don't rub my baby raw like some words do and they always finish the job.	&&&
I received a free sample of these wipes to give an honest review and I am so glad I did! I never thought to try these, as I was using a different brand labeled hypoallergenic, no fragrance and sensitive skin. I thought that was "just fine." My baby would fuss and try to get away when I changed her diaper or wiped her face. I thought that was just because she didn't like having to sit still or something. I noticed the wipes were leaving red marks, but they went away quickly so I just thought she was a little sensitive, but thought I was using the best product out there. Then, I got a sample of these seventh generation wipes. Free sample, worth a try right? Well, they were thick enough to get the job done but not too thick to be awkward to use. I used one sample on a diaper change. No fussing and no red streaks, yay! I used another as a face wipe, again no fussing and no red marks! Perfect! I am now convinced those other wipes had some bad chemicals in them despite the claims. These will be the wipes I purchase from now on, I am so glad I tried them for myself.	&&&
I've been using these for my baby for the past 6 months and I love them. I've tried two different brands (when I ran out of Babyganics) and neither measured up. These are soft and have never irritated my girl's bottom. Other wipes I've tried have led to redness. I have a monthly subscription so I never run out again!	&&&
These wipes are excellent for wiping hands, faces, noses and little bottoms. I ordered them for a small private preschool that I work at. We can use them on every child even the children with sensitive skins . Also the price per case is great.	&&&
These wipes are perfect for little kids when they are sick. They are moist and work perfectly when you are continuously wiping a runny nose. They make it so it isn't nearly as uncomfortable for the kid to have their nose wiped. My only complaint is the top part that opens and closes to get the wipes off isn't secured on the packaging super well. after multiple openings and closings it was easily loosened and eventually pulled off by my son. Otherwise a very great product!	&&&
These are they only wipes that I have found that are strong enough to be used for their intended purpose. Once you try these, other wipes will not be good enough. The thickness is far superior.	&&&
"Being biodegradable is both the best thing and the worst thing about this product. Of course, we're taking their word they are biodegradable, but a product this thin probably is. The positive reviews shocked me. It's as if thousands of guys, who have never used a wipe, decided to review this product.

The travel wipes are nice to have around and easy to get out of the package. Dude Wipes in the larger package are tough to get out without ripping them, and they have an odor while claiming to be unscented, although not horrible. Most guys use wipes for a particular area and having them tear is not something you want. I thought as I used more of them that they would come out easier but no such luck.

Finally, they cost much more than baby wipes. After taking a cruise, I got used to putting wipes in the trash, so I've decided to go back to baby wipes although I would consider using these again for travel."	&&&
The grape smell and flavor is VERY strong. I feel like baby would be more apt to let me wipe her teeth without the overwhelming fragrance since she loves to try to put regular baby wipes in her mouth. They are a bit pricey for how many you get, but I still prefer there for her 1.5 teeth over trying to use those fingertip toothbrushes with baby toothpaste.	&&&
The wipes stick together when pulling them out, multiple coming out at the same time. Difficult when you only have one hand to use.	&&&
"This is a great package!! I ordered the 2 week supply and it comes in a really nice canvas bag for storage. Each wipe is individually wrapped which is a great feature. I've bought similar face wipe products that have come in a baby wipe type package and those dry out quickly. Being individually wrapped really makes sure that you get the full supply and don't lose any to drying out.

I don't have an acne problem but do have a lot of blackheads and just uneven coloring. I'm almost at the end of my 2 week supply and definitely can tell there is an improvement with my blackheads. No blemishes or skin irritation from (or since) using the face wipes. I cannot attest to how it will work for severe acne cases but for mild skin issues, it is definitely a great product!!

The smell is a bit of a shock at first but its vinegar, what do you expect? You get used to it quickly and once your face dries, you don't smell like vinegar anymore.

I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own."	&&&
These are the only brand of wipes that don't give my babies rashes.	&&&
I have been using Free & Clear Baby Wipes for a long time now and I trust that they are gentle on my child's skin. They are a thicker, soft wipe and they are good for cleaning both face and bottoms. They work well for me and I trust them! I have received a free product for the purpose of my review. These opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
The wipes have strange scent, which is not really 'natural'. The wipe itself is tough, hard to tear in half. The material is strong. I don't really like them because they are rather harsh on baby skin, they do not feel soft. I wouldn't recommend to use them on sensitive baby bottom. Only good to wipe parents hands. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
Great cleaning and strong wipes. Everything you would want in a baby wipe	&&&
These wipes break apart into tiny pieces - will never purchase again.	&&&
Love my wipes........	&&&
I love these wipes, just wish you didn't get less wipes when buying the sensitive kind	&&&
Easy to use, great to fit in any bag.. keeps wipes moist for a long time. I bought two of these because i loved it so much i wanted to make sure i had one for all diaper bags for me and my husband	&&&
Best wipes hands down! They don't dry out delicate areas! Highly recommended!	&&&
"Is the best product for kitchen cleanup that I have ever used. The stove top is sparkling, easily cleaning up grease spatters. Same with the sink area. The faucet is also sparkling clean in kitchen and bathroom.
One of those products which was is better than advertised!!!! Which is a first."	&&&
pricey but I really like it	&&&
I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I found the medicated wipes to be very soothing and thought they did the job well! I love that they're flushable as well. Very hygienic!	&&&
These work wonders! We use them for our English Bulldog's chin acne and wrinkles twice a week. We've only been using them for a couple weeks now but there is already a noticable improvement in his chin. As for his wrinkles, it helps keep them clean but we still need to clean them in between wipes.	&&&
These wipes are very useful for small dogs and puppys. They clean well and dont dry up in the bag.	&&&
excellent mask cleaner!!!	&&&
I found these wipes to be extremely helpful for quick cleaning of my pump and parts when I was away from home. I was a SAHM with my son when he was little, so I didn't even use one entire pack during the 13mo I breastfed him, but they were great to have and convenient. I plan to buy another pack in a couple of months when our second child is born.	&&&
These are the only wipes we will buy. thanks for the savings of buying it on here!	&&&
"I received these wipes as a sample with a purchase. I wasn't expecting much as I've never had experience with Kat Von D's product line. Typically I use Neutrogena's wipes or Clinique's eye cleansing products. I honestly thought that if either of those products couldn't 100% remove all traces of my makeup then this couldn't either.
BOY WAS I WRONG!
Not only did these wipes remove EVERY STITCH of my powder, concealer, liquid and stain makeup, it flawlessly removed my many layers of mascara.
I am seriously impressed! I didn't have any residue left on my skin afterwards, but then again I ALWAYS follow up with a splash of water no matter what brand I use. I also didn't smell anything on the wipe or my face. The wipe itself was super moist (had little soap bubbles on them when I opened the package).
The only thing bad that I can say about this product is that it did burn my eyes for a few seconds after use, but did not linger as I've read from others. Product is definitely one I'd recommend."	&&&
Perfect flushable wipes	&&&
Box contains two resealable bulk bags of wipes	&&&
"This is the easiest thing to use and it's a great product. I love that I don't have to clean my baby's butt with cold wipes and that makes me feel good."	&&&
Love these boogie wipes for my kids. They smell great and they do a very good job on cleaning them noses. Especially when the allergy season gets here. I always carry these with me.	&&&
I Love thisproduct! I can carry them in the diaper bag, or in my purse and always know where they are. They're convenient Smell great and work amazingly	&&&
I've used these wipes since my child was born. I like them because they clean up any-size mess, they are strong and don't fall apart when cleaning said any-size mess, they don't cause my child's skin to break out, and the package re-seals well. I keep them in the nursery, diaper bag, stroller, car...pretty much anywhere my child may be.	&&&
Since I have a small apartment, I dont need too many heavy duty cleaning supplies and these wipes work great! I love the scent and they work great cleaning not too messy surfaces.	&&&
great product.	&&&
This is the easiest thing to use and it's a great product. I love that I don't have to clean my baby's butt with cold wipes and that makes me feel good.	&&&
Just the price itself it's amazing super pocket friendly and the product itself it's pretty damn good. I really enjoy this wipes !	&&&
They are very good for my glasses. Yes, I do recommend these.	&&&
Great product for our 16 yr old Yorkie who can no longer "hold it." But the last several orders did not include the Free Aloe Wet Wipes which seemed to help prevent any skin irritation.	&&&
The package said it came with a wipes box. It did not. Now I have to go buy a box of wipes to be able to use the refill packs.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are great on the go or at home when you don't want to fight with washing all the parts.	&&&
"Like many others wrote before me...tried several different wipes, loved these, used them the past 18 months, cancelled subscription to them, they are worse in more ways than one, they now give my daughter diaper rash.

Hubby wrote to them and they gave stock BS marketing response about how this change is all for the better yadda yadda yadda...giving my child a diaper rash is NOT ""better"" in any way shape or form.

Even if they pull a Seventh Generation and reintroduce the old formula I don't want to give this company my business any more."	&&&
got these to use instead of the cottonnelle wipes, which are more expensive. they are fragrance free and are a good size and thick enough but they burn. I called their 800 number and was told these are not suppose to burn so maybe I got a bad batch but I will not use them again. I can't imagine what they feel like on a baby's bottom, can't be good if they burn an adult.	&&&
I've used these wipes for four kids, and we've never had more than a little redness. They seem pretty good for delicate baby bottoms! Love the various different containers in here - the travel size is perfect for the diaper bag!	&&&
these wipes i use to disinfect everything i swear with having a toddler and its hard to clean when he is around this is wonderful i can just clean and disinfect all the nooks and crannies that his hands can fit that is just clean with no problem I'm happy that it leaves everything germ free:)	&&&
These wipes are great! I love that they are strong enough to clean some of the tougher stains but gentle enough for the easy ones. I also like that the lemon scent isn't overpowering.	&&&
"My son is 8 weeks old and we've used this on every diaper change since he came home from the hospital. This product really makes diaper changes so much enjoyable, especially those changes at 3 in the morning. There at times that I'm changing his diaper in the middle of the night and while I'm wiping him he is is still half asleep through the whole changing process. We put the warmer under our changing table and it's so convenient. The wipes get warm quickly after you refill it with a new pack. I would recommend this product to every mom!! This is such a genius invention. My boyfriend wants one for himself LOL ;)"	&&&
Usually comes up as most affordable choice per count on Amazon and these wipes work well for my son, no irritation issues.	&&&
I always make sure to have these on hand in my apartment. Very convenient and do a great job cleaning up messes. Especially great for counter tops or bathrooms!	&&&
These wipes do a great job cleaning and disinfecting. I always keep them on hand.	&&&
We have tried other wipes and these are our favorite by far!	&&&
As a newborn my little one got rashes often, but after using these wipes I must say it did help minimize the rashes.	&&&
I love Huggies wipes, I swear I have a pack in every room! They're very gentle on baby's bottom, and I even sometimes use them to clean fingerprints or food residue off of stuff! plus, I can usually find coupons so that is a plus.	&&&
I literally have 1 of these in each corner of my house! I always have one in my room because I hate germs, I'm always using these wipes & are always a must, along with other Lysol products	&&&
Used this product to keep my child's face clean of crusty nose. Kid friendly scent was nice. Really took care of cleaning up the crusties with little annoyance. It would be nice if this product was offered in a container and not pouches. When you grab for 1 cloth multiple come out with it and have to be shoved back into the pouch. The sticky closure, after a while, is no longer effective in keeping the cloths enclosed. You really have to use up your pouch to make sure you are not left with dried out product.	&&&
This brand works really well with taking off make up, but it also has a huge tendency to dry out my cheeks. It leaves dry red spots, but no peeling occurs. I love the smell of these wipes, but I just try not to really use them as much anymore.	&&&
I've used these "baby wipes" for years and my only complaint is that sometimes they fall out of sequence and do not pop up. However, this is a small inconvenience when you consider that they are good quality, yet the lowest cost I've found.	&&&
At first I thought this was a wipe warmer, well it's not. However, the weight in it makes pulling each wipe out so much easier. The wipes don't dry out & this container is so very handy! I like this so much better than the package that wipes normally come in!! Highly recommended!	&&&
These are some of my favorite face wipes! Since I found them a couple years ago I always have a pack or two on hand. They come in really handy when you're travelling and want to freshen up a bit too!	&&&
"I've been buying these wipes for about 2.5 yrs now and really love them. They are super strong and don't cause any
chafing on the bum bum. Since they are so strong I generally tear them in half and make 2 wipes out of one.

They don't have an awful scent and they make clean up a breeze."	&&&
These are great quality wipes. They keep my son's bum clean with no irritation! They don't pull apart easily like some wipes doneither	&&&
"Easier to get the wipes out of this container then the regular boogie wipes. Keeps the boogie wipes for a longer time then the packs as well."	&&&
These wipes were GREAT!! And the 50% off coupon made them $.50/pack!! Bargain!!	&&&
I use these wipes on a daily basis. I use them in our home and in our cars as well. The container is great. You can pull out a wipe at a time. My favorite feature is that not only do they clean but they disinfect too.	&&&
I switched to these wipes once my little guy got a little older. My favorite are still the Sensitive wipes but these are next best and do a little better job with big messes.	&&&
Best wipes on the market. They are so soft and easily wipe up the biggest blow outs. Both of my children have very sensitive, eczema prone skin and Huggies naturals care wipes has never given them a rash or break out. They are my go to for both clean bottoms and sticky finger while at home or on the go.	&&&
I love the baby fresh scent. I use less wipes than other brands I have tried.	&&&
"These are the only types of wipes we buy. They smell great (although you start to associate this smell with diapers, and not the clean diapers either). They're soft, they smell relatively good, and they certainly do their job cleaning off the bits that need cleaning.

My only complaint, and this is likely user error, is that sometimes the plastic tubs have the lid snap off, but each time i get a new box, I get a new tub which is helpful.

I've tried a variety of different wipes, from the cheap ones at walmart, to other brands versions, to the no-smell pampers wipes (sensitive), and these are by far my favorite. The cheaper ones are rougher and not as absorbant, and the sensitive ones lack the smell that I appreciate on these wipes.

All in all, you should look no further for your next box of wipes than Pampers Baby Fresh wipes. Look out for coupons too, as they make this an even better deal."	&&&
These wipes are my favorite cleaning product! Great price with subscribe and save.	&&&
My daughter will only use these wipes on my baby grandson. They are chemical free and very safe.	&&&
I always have Clorox wipes in my house, they come very handy, even at work I always need them to clean my work area	&&&
We use these in our office, home, car, camping, boating etc. It's a good thing to have around	&&&
Always great, even after slow use, and finally opening the last pack approx 1-year later. This is an easy favorite "just need it" buy.	&&&
Clorox wipes are an essential to keep anywhere and everywhere. They're good for a quick clean up as well as more thorough disinfecting cleaning. Also a great way to get the younger ones involved in cleaning.	&&&
I use clorox wipes on a daily basis to clean my apartment. I cant live without them, its the perfect product for a busy college student!	&&&
Good. No problems.	&&&
This makes my job so much easier! Cleaning up after my husband and kids is a breeze. one wipe with these bad boys and everything is clean and disinfected!	&&&
Love these wipes! they are of good quality the wipes themselves don't rip so easily like other wipes I have had in the past. I'm a big fan of these and will continue to buy them.	&&&
Very good product excellent portability	&&&
I use these for everything from wiping the bench to cleaning the bathroom. They don't smell like harsh chemicals but the get everything clean. They never dry out either like other wipes. Thick enough and large enough for the large jobs as well.	&&&
I thank GOD this came in on time,i cannot say how important quick access to BABY WIPES.and i don't have to leave home to go shopping.....!	&&&
The wipes smell amazing, I used them after my chem lab when I didn't have my germex and still felt refreshed! I received these complimentry for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own!	&&&
I like to use these wipes. they are very gentle, soft smell good. and very comfortable. i recommend	&&&
These are my go to Wipes, I like to buy them in the large box refill packages. Great especially on newborn baby sensitive skin and they were amazing when my son developed even the slightest diaper rash when others made diaper changes miserable.	&&&
They were ok. I think is a good price for the amount of wipes you get. However, I think the Huggies pure and natural and honest baby are better quality	&&&
Great product, cleans very well!	&&&
I love using these clorox disinfecting wet wipes on everything. It makes cleaning the house so easy.	&&&
These are not my favorite wipes. They are much thinner than other brands. They also tend to stick to themselves, making it difficult in a messy situation.	&&&
these wipes are fine. They are a less expensive alternate to some name brand wipes and work just as well.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes! Always using them in the dorm to clean up all sorts of messes and they work great!	&&&
Handy box comes with packets of wipes.	&&&
It cleans glasses really good no streaks or we spots	&&&
This wipes are grate. I used them for to clean almost everything in the house. So practical and clean...	&&&
"Pretty descent wipes.
Instead of toxic preservatives these wipes contain neutral for humans and lethal for microbes Silver Dihydrogen Citrate. All other ingredients are also non-toxic. This new formula is thicker than the old one.

Ingredients:

Purified Water, Citric Acid, Silver Dihydrogen Citrate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Citrate, Punica Granatum Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Extract, Cucumis Sativus Extract, Peucedanum Ostruthium Extract."	&&&
Love the product but i found them 5.00 cheaper at Sams	&&&
These are thick, clean well, and smell really nice.	&&&
Great value! I have allergies and this product is scent free.	&&&
I love this wipes. They clean well and also make the house smell so great.	&&&
I like how easy this product makes it for a quick clean up. The wipes even have a surface on it to help scrub the counter tops.	&&&
Great product	&&&
These washcloths are so soft. I originally used organic cotton washcloths that I bought at my local baby chain store, but those are so rough, they seem to hurt my son's face. These are lovely. We don't use them as baby wipes (as we use disposable jackson reese ones http://amzn.com/B00C2621WU) but I'm sure these would be perfect for that as they are also quite thin. As a washcloth, they might be slightly on the thin side, but they work really well and again, are so soft and comforting. They also seem to be very good quality.	&&&
These wipes are super-convenient for keeping my kitchen and bathroom super clean and germ-free. They're great for those quick cleanups in the bathroom, especially the toilet and sick when you get unexpected visitors and haven't had a chance for a complete top to tail.	&&&
I bought a ton of these when they were on sale at Kroger because I can use them on my face. I have sensitive skin and a lot of things make me break out, but these do not. They work great as make up removers.	&&&
Shipping took a while for this one, but was very pleased when it arrived. The box contains a wipes case/dispenser, refills, as well as travel packs.	&&&
This is a staple item in my house. I never run out of them - they are a must have - great for quick clean ups	&&&
Okay, so I am totally guilty of being that customer - I sometimes have a tendency not to review until something is bad. But my "good review" for these wipes was my subscription to them; I decided early on that they were my favorite brand of green wipes and have used nothing else almost since my son was born. Sadly, I will now be looking for a new brand of wipes. The most recent shipment was completely different - the wipes are much more thin (one of the best features of these wipes had been that they were nice and thick) and the packaging is terrible now. It used to have a little plastic door on the front that you pulled wipes through, which was great. Now they have that supposedly resealable sticker packaging that is TOTALLY NOT resealable for any real length of time. Not sure why they changed a good product, but these wipes are now a big no for me. I canceled my subscription and will be trying some other brands.	&&&
These wipes are amazingly soft and a great value. Uses them since my baby was born.	&&&
Cleans like Clorox wipes, without the chemicals. Has an after smell, which remains on your hands.	&&&
I use these wipes for my newborn during diaper changes. I like that they do not smell.	&&&
Love these wipes! I've never had any issue with them breaking my daughter out.	&&&
"Frankly, there's no such thing as a disinfecting wipe that smells good. I know some of the other reviewers have written some pretty positive things about the lemon & lime ""fragrance"" of these Lysol wipes, but I respectfully disagree.

It's a disinfecting wipe. It kind of stinks.

That said, it DOES smell a lot better than pretty much any other brand I've found and it does do a good job of cleaning up stains and hardened crud. It does what it does very well. But please do not use as cologne or perfume... you and your loved one will be left feeling disappointed.

And lemon-y."	&&&
I love these wipes they are my favorite! They are nice and gently on my baby's bottom. He doesn't have any kind of reaction to them.	&&&
As a single mom and working full time, time management and budgeting are essential on a day to day basis. The time and convenience from ordering this product directly through Amazon, alone, was a great value in and of itself. This saved me quite a bit of money by ordering the 1024 economy sized pack as well. Normally I would buy the 448 count box of Pampers Sensitive wipes at the store for a little over $15 per box, which doesn't include me searching high and low for coupons to save a couple bucks. However, after discovering that Amazon offers this product in an economy size package at such a reasonable price(and convenience) I'll continue ordering it from now on. The box had came pretty quickly to my doorstep, when ordering it as a prime member. This item is only the standard refill packages, which is fine with me since I have a plastic container I continuously use.	&&&
These wipes are so soft and durable and I love using them on my child. My child has sensitive skin and these are not irritating at all. They are fabulous with all clean ups and my son does not pull away when I use them on him. These are definitely a keeper in my house.....I received sample packs to use for free for my honest and unbiased review. I now carry these everywhere.	&&&
Very high quality wipes. Thick, better than expected. No need for name brand with these in the market	&&&
Very cloth-like and non-irritating. Big sized wipes. Nice smell.	&&&
They are stiffer and harsher than other wipes we've used - even store brands. Now we have a lot of these to go through before we can buy some more. :(	&&&
I've used all sorts of brands of wipes -- received more expensive brands of wipes as gifts and didn't like some at all (do not like when they are too thick since I feel like I can't wipe baby as well). When it came to purchasing them ourselves, I have found that I like these the best. They are gentle, unscented and get the job done. I also use them after working out to clean my face. A lady who gave me a facial once used and recommended this exact brand to remove makeup before starting the facial. My only complaint- or more of my husband's complaint- is that sometimes when you pull one wipe out, a couple more come with it... it only happens once in a while and I feel like it has more to do with how he pulls them out of the box :) I have used these for the past 2 years for two kids now, one with sensitive skin, and have had no issues.	&&&
"I love these wipes. They smell great and are very durable. I leave one in each bathroom and when I need to quickly wipe a spot down, this is my go to wipes.

The only downside so far is the the way I received them on my second order. For some reason the liquid inside had leaked out even though they looked like they were sealed. I had to contact Amazon and get a replacement.

I can recommend this to anyone for quick clean ups."	&&&
I did not prefer these but only because they are unscented. That's just a matter of personal preference though and since my daughter does not need sensitive wipes we use baby fresh. If you're really needing sensitive wipes though I'd recommend these!	&&&
For the first year of my baby I used the Pampers sensitive wipes. I decided to give these a try. I don't care for them. They are not as wet and do not clean the skin as well as the sensitive wipes. I feel like I have to wipe multiple times over the same area to feel like I have cleaned it.	&&&
"They are the same as other huggies wipes
They are pretty strong I got them because they where on sale"	&&&
I love lysol disinfecting wipes!	&&&
I love these Clorox Wipes. They are very convinient and I use them to clean my microwave,bathroom, and kitchen! ?	&&&
Worked better than Swiffer....the dirt sticks to the wipe even when u r pulling it off the mop to throw it away. We have 4 cats, 2 dogs, and between 4-wheeling and gardening, we always are tracking in dirt. Instead of using half a box of Swiffer's to clean the main floor of my home....I only used 2 of the Clorox dust wipes.	&&&
Shipped on time and the wipes are very easy to use to quickly clean my silver jewelry.	&&&
We used the Pampers Sensitive wipes for about a year and a half until we were certain our son didn't have overly sensitive skin, at which point we bought whichever Pampers wipes were a better value when we shopped for them. These were by far my favorite wipes. I loved the thickness and the texture of them. Our son rarely had even mild diaper rash and I credit this to the Sensitive diapers and wipes, as well as frequent diaper changes. We'll definitely be using these with Baby 2 due this summer!	&&&
I love this product I have used it on both my kids from the time they were born an now I us e them on mi daughter. An she has crazy skin. But I jus love these wipes.	&&&
Great on my son's a runny nose. I prefer using these over regular wipes since there are less "ingredients" in the boogie wipes	&&&
Wonderful surprise! These wipes are thick and pleasant to use. High quality, love the performance. I wear a lot - and I mean a lot of makeup, one wipe and it's removed! These do not irritate my EXTREMELY sensitive skin, either. I use to use another more expensive brand that didn't work as well. So glad I found these!	&&&
These are the only wipes I will use!!! They smell amazingly fresh and clean!	&&&
these clorox wipes are very good for keeping germs down since i have small children. they clean up very well	&&&
I've been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it! It carries the perfect amount of wipes without taking a huge amount of space in my diaper bag.	&&&
I use these all the time. I like the smell, and the surfaces do not have a sticky or slimy feel to them after using them. The ridges in the cloth makes it easy to scrub a tough spot, and the wipes are small enough to tackle a job and throw them away.	&&&
I love having Clorox wipes in my home with children, it makes cleaning up after them a breeze. I find myself using this product continuously for wiping down door handles, stair railings, and counters. I also like that they are not terribly expensive, hold up well, and smell good.	&&&
Great for sensitive skin for any age. Have been using these wipes now going on 20 months and have tried others and have not found anything even comparable	&&&
These are great to wipe your little persons face. But they are a little pricy. Solely because of the price, I'll stick to my regular diaper wipes.	&&&
These wipes work great. The only drawback to the refill pack is they do not include an extra holder. Mine is beat up and it would be nice to have a replacement provided with each refill pack.	&&&
"So even though some think a wipe warmer is just a wipe warmer, it took me about a week and 3 store visits to finally decide on one. I wanted a warmer that I could move easily without having to unplug it from behind my changing table. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that this warmer has a removeable AC jack. As for how it heats is another bonus. I prefer a top heating warmer because it is just logical that you would want the warmest wipe being the one you would grab first. Also it really prevents any kind of browning. It has two heat settings which is lovely. I live in warmer weather so the warmest setting I only have to use in winter. The light on it is convenient and not too bright. Some were having a problem with the "ultra" babies r us warmer, saying that the locks were not holding the lid down. If you open that box you will see the AC cord is not removable so in order for them to package it they have to stick the cord inside the warmer and jam the top shut. If you ask me that is very bad packaging and is the reason for these locks to give way. With the removable AC jack in this one that CANNOT happen. Overall SUPER SATISFIED AND GLAD I WAITED!!!"	&&&
i love these wipes they are thick and do not irritate my little ones skin. I been using these on my baby since day one.	&&&
best ones out there. no smells, no sticky residue and no issues/reactions with baby and her very delicate skin.	&&&
These wipes work okay. They kind are more like the pamprs wipes than the hugs ones I usually buy. They are kind of like a cloth but in a fuzzy way on one side. I didn't notice that they seem drier as some people have said and I might just be picky but I like the hugs wipes and will stick with those. Now if you don't have a preference or like those other kind these would likely be perfect for you. They are worth trying because it's a great deal if you end up liking them. The tub is well made and sturdy and will last a long time with all the refills in the case and then some. I love the tub.	&&&
We use it on the stroller so we always have wipes on hand. It's very sturdy and has yet to break or even pop open while on the stroller. Oxo is a great brand	&&&
Very disappointed because they are not very durable, the wipes feels like paper towel and rips right away.	&&&
I seriously love having these things handy for when I need to remove some makeup or just feel like refreshing my face a bit! I'm a fan of Simple cleansing wipes and so is my super sensitive skin!	&&&
These are great at getting your makeup off (including mascara), and make your face feel fresh and clean without scrubbing too hard. The only problem I had was the wipes themselves were a little dryer than I preferred. I think maybe I got an old package or something, but if you just wet it a little bit, it works fine.	&&&
I don't care for Huggies wipes. They seem harder on my baby's bottom. They almost feel like a wet paper towel as opposed to a baby wipe. Not a fan.	&&&
We are official huggies people. My daughter can't use pampers ANYTHING. Pampers breaks her out and Huggies are amazing. I love the wipes I use them to remove makeup as well.	&&&
I love the wipes i keep them in my bag in the nursery and in the car it helps me a lot with my twins	&&&
The concept is great. Warm wipes for your baby's tush. I panicked in my 38th week of pregnancy thinking I wasn't ready because I didn't have a wipe warmer. I will just say...most useless thing ever. Dried out the wipes. Was not something I used more than once. But again, concept is amazing. If you can make it work for you, you may love. But don't panic at end of your pregnancy thinking you NEED this. :)	&&&
It cleans well and feels nice	&&&
"My family has used these for as many years as I can remember with no problems, until last carton I purchased over a month ago.
The individual wipes feed one at a time and then you have to pull a big clump of three or more all at once. A real waste. Can this be fixed when you address all the smell issues of others?"	&&&
My wife is not easily pleased by wipes and has always driven me back to the brand name ones when I've tried to get something cheaper in the past. Since we started getting these several months ago, I have not gotten one complaint. They will be on autoship until kid #3 leaves diapers behind.	&&&
"Great for removing ALL kinds of glue residue. I use on plastic bottles I recycle for my herb blends, to get the impossible-to-remove labels off. Have used them on critters for removing surgical-type tapes too.
MANY household uses for gooey- sticky.........your imagination can be endless!!"	&&&
I am an avid athlete, playing volleyball, lacrosse, running, and zumba several times a week. I keep these in my bag for right after these activities and I have to say I love them soooo much! I have really oily skin with a tendency to break out on my chin and a little on my forehead but I take good care of my skin so I rarely have more than a few blemishes. Unlike most facial wipes, these don't leave any feeling of any type of residue on my face. The smell isn't very strong and is a pleasant one, and my face ALWAYS feels clean. I have recommended to friends and they love them too!	&&&
I love these wipes I have them in the car at work and at my house . These are. Must have ! And they don't have a strong ugly smell either they smell great !	&&&
These wipes polish our stainless steel appliances very well and does not leave the usual streak marks.	&&&
Perfect amount of moisture and very soft. I've tried a few other brands of wipes but always come back to Pampers.	&&&
"I have purchased this product through subscribe and save since June 2014. The ingredients and wrapping changed with the 12 pack I received in December 2015. The previous version had a blue starburst pattern as background, the current version has white in the background on the packaging. As others have noted, the new wipe is smaller in size but that is not the reason I can no longer use these wipes. The new version caused irritation and I developed small tears in my anal skin. My doctor inspected and said there was nothing fungal going on. I still had a couple packs of the old version so I switched back. With about three days of using the old version, the irritation went away and the tears healed. The new version of this product causes skin irritation and skin tears that the old version did not cause. I am including ingredient lists for both the old and new version below.

love these wipes and when I first came home with the baby and could not make it to the store, I was so grateful to be able to order these online!	&&&
These are the best wipes you can possibly buy for your newborn. We tried other brands but ended up with these because of their top quality.	&&&
We needed a lot of wipes for the myriad of electronic devises in the house and this container fit the bill.	&&&
The majority of the wipes were dry and therefore less effective than the other brands we've bought at Walmart.	&&&
"Great size and closure. Keeps wipes moist and with a lovely presentation!
Just make sure you close it properly or the wipe will dry out very easily (the one on top)"	&&&
"I have no idea, how I lived without these wipes. I'm sold on these for the foreseeable future. As I've said before, if you had to choose between wiping dried mud off of your hands, what would you use, dry paper towels or wet ones. Both is what I say. These leave one feeling fresh and clean.

Once you've started using these, you'll wonder why the hell you haven't bought them earlier. And to anyone that says, ""Just do a better job at wiping"", there's no way in hell you can tell me that wiping you butt with dry toilet paper is just as effective or even better than using these wipes AFTER you've wiped with TP."	&&&
I love huggies diapers and huggies wipes!!!! They are super soft with just the right about of moisture. These refill packs are nice, they ziplock close keeping the rest of the unused wipes still moist. There is also a divider sheet that keep the other half moist!	&&&
"Let's start out by saying these are not cheap, I bought the 10 pack which brings each wipe to a little over a dollar.
The wipe is maybe 4"" by 2"" so it's definitely large enough for even the largest lips. Even though the wipe took off almost all of my lipstick, or in this case Occ Lip Tar, I didn't notice any of the so called benefits that is suppose to come with application.
My lips felt the same after rubbing the wipe on my lips.
I wasn't a fan of the smell at all either, it smelled kinda gluey, although that is a personal preference. Now that I'm done with my criticism lets talk about the pros!
They would be perfect for someone who is always on the go as all you have to do is rip open the seal and you can change your lipstick in the car or even while you're walking!
The mirror is super cute too, it's the size of a small button!
The bag is a decent size to carry all your lip necessities in a cute little bag i.e: your lip balm, lipstick, mirror, and a wipe. With all that being said I would only recommend them to you if you like to change your lipstick on the go and don't have immediate access to a bathroom.
I personally prefer using a wet tissue but that's just me."	&&&
very nice product my kids noses don't get sore and red from wiping over and over	&&&
Love Huggies wipes! Neither one of my children broke out. They are made kinda thick to get the job done	&&&
Just what I wanted. Loved it.	&&&
I love that these wipes are scentless and do a great job cleaning up big messes!	&&&
I received a free sample of these wipes from Smiley360.com. They really helped to relieve the discomfort associated with hemorroids. And they are a lot easier to use than messy creams and gels. Not only did I find them useful, but so did my teenaged daughter. I would definitely recommend this product.	&&&
"I have twin girls (4 years old at this point) and these are simply the best baby wipes I tried over the last 4 years. They stay moist and no poopie finger syndrome.

Even though my daughters have been pottie trained for 2 years we still purchase these to keep around for mess cleanup.

The price on Amazon fluctuates so much on Amazon it is sometimes cheaper to purchase at costco. However, if I could get them for the right price on Amazon, we were never disappointed."	&&&
With my first baby, there were a lot of recommendations on what brand to use for Miyumi. I went through many trails with other brands but never was disappointed with Pampers Sensitive wipes. It makes it very easy to wipe her dirty work and go on smooth and leave it feeling soft!	&&&
It's good for my baby	&&&
top half portion of the wipes are almost dry. i would not buy this again.	&&&
I am never without them. An absolute must you those of us that have any kind of a bowel disorder or anyone who wants to feel fresher.	&&&
I use these wipes every night. They are my new favorites. They the job and smell wonderful.	&&&
Love these Clorox wipes especially to clean up my children's messes. Great smell and does the job	&&&
Love these wipes. For the price they are awesome for any computer screen.	&&&
Great to use to remove makeup or to freshen face. Does not dry your skin.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes! You get a great quantity of wipes for a great price! Also, they don't tear very easy which is something that bugs me when i'm trying to clean up a messy baby or dirty diaper! Won't buy any other brand!	&&&
I really like these diapers, they work very well on my small chihuahua. They absorb well and I haven't had any leaking problems.	&&&
I love Sephora but this was a big disappointment! Does not remove makeup well at all.	&&&
theses are so wonderful	&&&
love them .very soft n gentle . gets the job done . love everything about it . love huggies natural care wipes 	&&&
I uses Clorox wipes on a very regular basis. So much easier than a towel and cleaning solution. They are durable, portable, and they smell great.	&&&
I thought these would be the swme quality as clorox but they are not. Everytime i use them on glass there is a tacky flim left over. I dont recommend this product and will buy the name brand next time.	&&&
I go a little crazy when I run out of these wipes. They are wonderful for cleaning every single part of the house - bathrooms, the kitchen... all of it! Also make spills and other messes an easy abd quick clean up!	&&&
These wipes are very moist and the job I could go with out the strong sent and residue left behind.	&&&
Whomever invented these DESERVES to be a millionaire. Great product.......	&&&
Used Pampers Sensitive wipes before this, and baby was still developing a rash, seemed to do better with these! Have these on automatic delivery.	&&&
We have been buying these since the beginning and our twins are 2.5 now. Sure, you could just use a regular baby wipe, but for myself I align the scent of that to diaper changes. Eeeeeeew. Boogie Wipes smell better, and because of the saline, they get the crunchy boogies from nap or night time off quickly. A must try!	&&&
They work, but not as moist as store bought wipes	&&&
These wipes are wonderful. They do not have a lot of perfumes to it and are gentle on the skin. I used the regular Huggies wipes since I ran out of these. They have too much perfume and my son started to developed red spots. So I purchased these in bulk. His red spots have gone away. Definitely recommend.	&&&
I use these wipes all the time!!!	&&&
These are great baby wipes. The huggies are strong and sturdy and work well for a baby!	&&&
I love the wipes! I would rather have more wipes than the wipe holder in every box	&&&
I've always liked the Lysol disinfecting wipes I would highly recommend them to moms or just anyone that likes to be clean	&&&
"These kill your hands if you are at all sensitive, so wear gloves, but they are great for wiping down cat litter boxes. That's the best reason to buy these when the world is pretty much drowning in extra garbage.

There are tutorials for making your own disinfectant sprays. There are even tutorials for making your own disinfectant wipes, but those all use paper and get stored in plastic. Find these at a good price, and then look for refills.

If you're not using disinfectant wipes to clean up actual cat waste, there are less caustic and more food-surface friendly options - even compostable options. But the Lysol wipes are great for litter boxes. Toilets and bathroom floors, too."	&&&
Great product to keep near to clean laptop. They work well, don't leave smears on screen, etc..	&&&
My two year old loves these! I think the design helps make it more fun, plus she feels special using her own special wipes when going potty. The only downside is the strong scent. I wish they came in an unscented option.	&&&
These are great for potty training! I bought my son a container once and he really enjoyed them and the box with the stickers was his favorite part. I loved that he could design it and add his name on it, My only complaint is I didn't like the amount of the wipes for the price.	&&&
The best wipes out there... hands down. They wipe so smoothly, it is always so easy to clean up a messy diaper. And the price on Amazon is great!!!!!	&&&
The best wipes for tender noses!	&&&
Love this product. As advertised, I got a bulk set. Loved that I got 2 travel size wipes.	&&&
"I guess these are cheaper, but I have to use more than I do with Pampers ""Sensitive"" wipes and Huggies ""One & Done"" wipes. So overall, I end up using more of these than the other types.
These are best if you use wipes for face/hand cleaning, or for dusting or household cleaning. They're not as good for poo.
They do stay intact and don't tear easily, which is also helpful. But I think I'll be switching to the thicker ones so I use less overall."	&&&
"I thought this was a great answer to the problem of my wipes drying out, but I was wrong. I have purchased 2 of these and within 2 weeks each one came apart where the glue holds the pop open lid onto the holder. I called the company to inform them. They told me they've received other complaints about this happening. They offered to send me another one or to send out coupons for other products in the amount of what I spent on the product. They did NOT offer a monetary refund. I didn't want another clutch b/c I had already had 2 with the same problem. So, I opted for the coupons. Hopefully they will get used."	&&&
These wipes were very very useful especially on a baby boy who has very sensitive skin!	&&&
What can I say, we have 4 kids ages 2 up to 15 and every one of them have used them over and over. I keep the, in the car, in my purse, in the kids's backpacks, garage, anywhere you can think of, I keep a small stash of them. Perfect size to even fit into my husband's wallet. I stuck one in there and he didn't even notice!	&&&
Ordering a big box at one time is SO much easier.	&&&
Love this wipe case. Better than all others.	&&&
I've been using these wipes for several years now, they work great on glasses as well as smartphone and tablet screens.	&&&
These wipes are great, and they don't have that strong odor that many of the fragrant wipes have. They work great and are really strong.	&&&
These wipes are always in my house. They are so easy to use and they make cleaning quick!	&&&
Got a good deal on this 3 pack. Clorox brand is a name I can trust, not much more to say about it. The wipes do all the dirty work. No need to use any other product when using these wipes. These are the smaller packs so if your obsessed like I am you may use them up to fast. I love using these cleaning wipes, so doesn't everyone else in my family, including my 5 year old niece. She loves to help clean when these wipes are involved. You can literally use these wipes to clean just about any surface in your home/car."}},	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wet Wipes are my favorite Disinfecting Wet Wipe. I can always trust that I am getting things clean AND disinfected when I need them to. They seem to be more durable than the other brands and they smell pretty great too. Clorox is a name that I have trusted for many many years so I know that I am getting the best protection for my family. I have a container in every room of the house to use for quick clean ups. They are a MUST during cold and flu season too	&&&
Super convenient wipes. Always have some on hand to wipe my sunglasses as well as my safety glasses.	&&&
Alwways buy these wipes for cleaning up. Better value than clorax and cheaper. Smell great too/	&&&
When you are on a budget, these are the best. They aren't the softest or thickest wipes but just keep some baby powder and/or diaper rash cream handy and all will be well.	&&&
Love these wipes. I have containers to hold them too. These are the only kind I buy. For a reason!	&&&
These wipes have got to be my favorite. I have tried other brands but not really happy with them. These are great especially for quick and easy clean up!	&&&
THE BEST WIPES! I bring this great product everywhere! i always purchase few at a time at Target! It it so useful and keep the house so clean! I lovelovelove it!	&&&
Love this product, They are very durable and smell great!	&&&
I had these tucked into my backpack just in case of emergencies, and lo and behold, mother nature decided to come for a visit this week. Being at school, these wipettes were lifesavers. I love their sweet refreshing smell and the convenience of these little wipes. Thank goodness I received them to test for free. I am definitely going to go buy more soon, since I have seen their usefulness on the go.	&&&
CAUTION: These used to be the world's premier wipe, but for inexplicable reasons have decided to switch and start producing laughable, ineffective, low-end products. I've called Earth's Best and spoken to their customer service. Apparently they're fielding thousands of complaint calls, but have absolutely no justification for ruining these wipes. Just some baloney about having improved the package. Well, guess what, we're a little more concerned with what's IN the package. Improve the package, but ruin the product? Really? Cost saving? Probably. However, I and most reviewers are, and always have been, more than willing to pay a premium price for a premium product - so that justification just doesn't fly. Their customer service indicated they have no intention of again producing the superior wipe they used to. Earth's Best, formerly premium organic brand - now I would recommend against buying ANYTHING they make. It would be interesting to hear from CEO Irwin Simon as to what their thought process was. Why do great companies shoot themselves in the foot? Unbelievable.	&&&
I can't tell you how much I love these wipes! I have tried all the brands of baby wipes and finally settled for this. These wipes are really good at removing oil, grime, dirt and just about anything else. Not just baby wipes, I've used them for other purposes all the time like wiping my cellphone screen, cleaning the whiteboard, rubbing off markers and paints from just anywhere. They clean well and smell really great - like water. I never knew water can smell so clean and pure. I love using them because I know they are just soaked in water and grapeseed extract, and nothing else. No chemicals or fragrances. Even if it costs more, it is so worth it. I must mention that they last a long time too. Each pack can last me months without drying up. Since it has become my favorite brand of wipes, I keep a pack with me everywhere I go. Bottom line: Get it!	&&&
I LOVE these wipes! The first time I bought them, I only got them to try because I had an amazing coupon, and I found that I like them better than any other wipes I've tried! They are soft, they don't bunch up when you're wiping, they smell nice, and they seem to work wonders on sensitive skin. I like that they are attached to each other, so when you pull one, the next pops up (amazingly, not all wipes are packaged this way, so you end up having to dig in the container to get the next one). The top on the package is a sturdy plastic, and opens and closes very easily. I can't say enough good things about these wipes. They are a tad over-priced, in my opinion...maybe not over-priced for being natural, etc, but definitely more than I like to pay for a package of baby wipes. They are double the cost of Huggies, Pampers, Parents Choice, etc, and I won't even pay full price for those. In my opinion, they are not worth double the cost of other brands of baby wipes, but I don't like spending much money, especially on products that are not reusable, so don't take that to mean the quality is poor or anything, I just wouldn't pay full price for them because I think full price is too high. ALL of that being said, if I had unlimited resources and could afford not to budget, these would DEFINITELY be the only wipes we used in our home. We LOVE them.	&&&
very handy and convenient wipes. while pricier than buying the spray this is good for a quick cleanup. the 3 pack price on amazon cant be beat by in store prices.	&&&
"I like how these come in their own package that can easily open and closed. These are cheap and better packaged than the Huggies wipes I used to get before this.

There is nope scent and they feel smooth to the touch. I am sure any baby would appreciate that.

However the lid is still just glued on to the plastic container. From time to time the lid would come off and explode the wet wipes to the drying air."	&&&
I wasn't sure I would like these wipes. I'm pretty picky. If I had to compare these wipes, to me it would be a perfect combination of Huggies and Pampers. Soft, yet strong.	&&&
Great wipes. Much better than the original wipes	&&&
I've tried a number of dog wipes but this works the best for my dog. Not changing brands anymore!	&&&
I have to say they didn't sting, nor smell perfumed, and do the job. They are gentle, and didn't aggravate a "condition". I actually like them better than the big diaper branded wipes. Our city is highly concerned with wipes being disposed down the toilet. So this is a double win.	&&&
Been using these wipes on my 5 month old since day one, never had any problems. Very durable.	&&&
Pampers Sensitive wipes are so much more in quality as they are real cloth-like wipes that have become used in more ways than just for changing babies. This combo has everything one will need, as it has refills, travel packs, & a hard plastic case that comes filled vs. empty like in some other brands combo packs. Great package & full of meeting your needs. Priced competitively.	&&&
These wipes are hit and miss.....some of them will be moistened while others will be completely dried out. If you aren't near a sink thats a problem...	&&&
I love these wipes. I'm able to remove both eyes' makeup with one wipe, even heavy makeup! Takes off waterproof eyeliner easily but is gentle on my lashes. I just wish there was an option to buy these in bigger quantities to a container, like a 24 or 48 wipe option.	&&&
I'm not a fan of these wipes. They are really thin bUT they are soft. They get the job done. I just prefer other brands that feel sturdier.	&&&
These wipes are much thinner and drier compared to Pampers and Huggies. Not a fan.	&&&
I use these for my 4 year old who dosen't wipe the greatest after no.2 so I help him out if need be. He started screaming and said please stop using these burning wipes on my butt! Now I do tend to get up close and personal down there to wipe it fresh and clean so I thought ok. I won't use these on you anymore since your butt is now FIRE RED. So I had an entire pack to use up so my husband and myself decided to use them after we went to the bathroom....only to find out OUCH!! Burn burn burn!! Same for my husband. I had my 86 year old mother over dog sitting and she too said the same exact thing. WOW. We can use anything on our skin and I wouldn't consider myself, husband, or son to be a sensitive skin for ANYTHING. My butt is STILL healing. These things are horrible garbage! We bought cheap parents choice at Walmart. We've also used Huggies and just about every other wipe out there. I thought these were supposed to be good but they ARE NOT	&&&
i really liked these at first but over time it seems like it's made things quite tender in a very personal spot. Not to get too graphic- but I'm itchy and it's become painful to wipe with either wet wipes or regular toilet paper. I would like to find a wet wipe that may have different cleansers or emollients in it. Or none at all.	&&&
Hard to dispense individual wipes.	&&&
I've shopped around for wipes and these are great. Like the scent and not rough on skin.	&&&
I don't like any of the scented wipes so these are perfect for us. Its the primary wipe we use! Its great for her sensitive skin.	&&&
I'm in love with these wipes! They are thick enough to handle even the biggest blowout! With other brands i feel like i'm just pushing the mess around. I have a 2 month old and a 4 year old. We all love them, including my husband. And i love the new packaging. Super cute! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I have tried many different brands of baby wipes on my children who are now 2 and 3, and these are far and away the best. In my opinion, they offer the best combination of strength and value without an irritating scent, and they are always available at a great price for refills.	&&&
Huggins wipes have always been my favorite wipes. I have tried other brands but they just don't clean up strong like Huggies. I always end up w a huge mess and getting frustrated with the bargain brands. I would love to see more coupon options for wipes.	&&&
Good for the price but dries up the wipes. I bought a moisture pad for it which took up even more of the little space available for wipes, helped with the dryness but not completely.	&&&
These monitor wipes are pretty good and they leave no streaks.	&&&
Great wipes, only brand I buy, smell good, don't dry out fast. And don't make skin dry or itch,	&&&
These are my favorite cleaning wipes.	&&&
This is SO perfect for me to put in my purse and one for my son's backpack without the bulkiness.	&&&
We ALL use these and love them - my only complaint is that they are a little hard to get out of the packaging - they aren't staggered so that pulling one out releases the next one for easy grabbing. They are stacked directly on top of each other. That is the only thing I would change though!	&&&
These felt soapy and irritated my daughter's skin! Granted she has sensitive skin but we kept them around anyway and used them on other things and still didn't like them. The scent is not my favorite either.	&&&
These are the best wipes (especially for babies with sensitive skin). There are no extra chemicals or preservatives. No harsh smell or residue.	&&&
My family loves the GERM-X wipes better than the liquid. The liquid you are rubbing the dirt in and not taking it off ... with these similar to cloth wipes you see the filth that is on your hands or any other places you decide to use them.	&&&
Love these wipes!	&&&
I wouldn't be without this product. It is great for cleansing your face especially on those nights when you are too lazy to wash with water and whatever. The saline in these wipes makes your skin feel clean but not tight. It's also great for wiping inside your nose when you have a cold or when its allergy season. After blowing your nose, just wipe inside each nostril; the saline has a sanitizing effect and rids the nose of irritating residue.	&&&
Good quality!	&&&
Guys -- they really work. Instead of using other products for whatever reason they work for guys instead of smelling like a baby or other wipes - these are specifically for DUDES. FIVE STARS.	&&&
I don't know how I ever lived without these. After I've finished using the restroom, even after doing a great job at wiping, Let's be honest, if you had to choose between wiping dried mud off your hands with a dry paper towel or a wet one, what would you choose? I say both. And these wipes are a fantastic way to stay clean. Even if one hasn't use the restroom, these are great to freshen up when I'm on the go and it's been a hot sweaty day. The equipment down there, just starts to feel a little dirty. So even if you're not cleaning your butt, these are great to clean up your male equipment.	&&&
Easy one handed open and close. And the weighted plate means you can pull a wipe out one handed too. You can even put the pack of wipes in there in its wrapper if you're lazy.	&&&
I have been buying these on Amazon for quite some time and the quality is very good. They smell amazing (there are the unscented varieties as well) and I love Huggies because of the thick texture, the moisture is just right (not too dry or too wet), and the amount that you get for the price is very good. These are great for just about everything, from removing makeup to personal hygiene (the Cottonelle wipes are ok because they're flushable, but these give you more bang for your buck) and everything in between. I highly recommend these.	&&&
I am a big fan of these wipes and that they come in the mail. Not having the carry this big heavy box out to the car is the best.	&&&
I love the smell of the face wipes! Plus the wipes themselves a nice a thick and they can wipe up a full face. It leaves my skin nice and soft and better looking. I have to hide them from my roommates	&&&
By far a staple in my house I could not live without it I use Clorox cleanup wipes on everything	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own." This product us very convenient and discreet. Gas a great scent. Very effective and works fast without the mess. Thanks smiley360 for the great product.	&&&
I love the disinfecting wipes so much. I use them everyday for my kitchen!!! I love feeling like I am free of germs and have a clean house!!! Nothing worse than having a messy house full of germs.	&&&
I love the thickness and softness of the wipes. It makes cleaning up those dirty messes in baby's diaper so much easier!	&&&
These wipes are pretty thin and definitely not soft. They're okay in a pinch, but I prefer them just for wiping faces rather than bottoms.	&&&
Tried these wipes which took 7-8 to get the piece clean Not worth it in my book. I usually use Twinkle which does a better job.	&&&
Love how moist and gentle they are for my son. He has sensitive skin and doesn't give him a rash like all the other wipes.	&&&
Great for sensitive skin	&&&
Love these wipes!!! Only brand I will use. Soft and easy to pull out. never have to use more than two.	&&&
wipes come out two or three at a time.	&&&
Love these wipes. They are a little thin, but when you/your children have sensitive skin it's worth it! My daughter has never had a problem with them wipes and has had some breakouts with others.	&&&
This is the dispenser to hold any wipes you have. So much better than those cheap plastic wipe dispensers.	&&&
I use these wipes a lot because I have two older dogs who are not as able to control themselves as they used to be, so we sometimes have accidents. I use the "puppy pads" too, but sometimes they miss the pad a little and I clean up extra moisture with a paper towel, then also clean with these to eliminate odor and germs. I've been using the clorox ones, but these are doing just as well as far as I can tell, and I think I like the fragrance a little better. Of course, that's a matter of personal taste. I think if you're trying to decide which to buy; that might be personal taste, too, but I certainly wouldn't hesitate to buy these.	&&&
Love the these wipes	&&&
Best soother for sore little noses	&&&
Love these wipes! I only use these! My baby reacted to other wipes. I have GSE that I add to the wipe container when I add a little more water!	&&&
DO NOT USE FOR CLEANING SMART PHONE SCREENS!!!! I was wondering why there was so much friction when using my stylus since my stylus worked fine on other people's cell phones. I regularly would use Zeiss wipes to clean my screen which would do a great job. However, because it contains Alcohol (Isopropyl), it does something to the screen which has left using any stylus impossible and I would try different stylus with no difference. Luckily I'm due for a phone upgrade and will be getting a new phone soon. You can bet I won't be using Ziess cleaning wipes on my new phone. Live and learn!	&&&
These "basic" wipes do the trick at a lower price than Pampers Unscented. I was happy with the purchase and would definitely buy again!	&&&
I ordered a box of these wipes to use for my 2.5yr old and our newborn. We received them withing two days and I did not open them for a few weeks. When I did open them I took out a pack and pulled out two wipes to clean my 2yr olds face. After wiping her face she immediately turned bright red and said her face hurt so we had to rush to a bathroom to wash her face with soap and warm water. Her face stayed red for over an hour. I won't use these wipes again and currently have an entire box of baby wipes that are only good for cleaning off the high chair and toys. Really disappointed in this purchase.	&&&
These wipes are good. you can tell they are free of chemicals. But I assumed they would have more moist!	&&&
"The seller does not specify that this is a smaller size than other waterwipes.
Kinda rip off when you sell similar to the other ones that are bigger. # of wipes is same.
In the picture, they have folded the waterwipe covering so that you cannot see what the size is.
Another poor way to scam consumers.

As for the mold, I have yet to see one.
We do not put back what we have touched and this have been successful at preventing mold build up."	&&&
This thing is awesome for wipes!!!! I hate the containers that they come in because after awhile you can't always get them out when you need to. This is a great product :)	&&&
These do the trick, but I've been using regular Windex wipes for years and I'm not sure I can tell the difference. They both do a great job. I gave this 4 stars because I'm a bit of a clean freak and I still had a little dusty residue on the corners of my monitor. So I either had a really dusty monitor, or I did a poor job of cleaning, or, these may leave some dusty residue. But they're definitely worth it to try!	&&&
I purchased these after my friend recommended them to me. We had been using pamper's sensitive wipes, but a rash and irritation kept coming back. Less than 24 hours after switching to Water Wipes, the redness was gone. These are simply water and fruit extracts. I feel better about wiping his face and his bum with these.	&&&
"I'm not someone who generally gives a bad review, but here's the deal...
Dude Wipes seem to break apart every time I go to use them. Not once, not a few times... Always. Whenever I try and remove a new wipe from the package, it either rips in half or takes out 6 addiotnal wipes. It's really quite annoying.
And it's not like I'm new to the baby wipe game, I've been doing this for 20 years now!
That being said, the ""aloe"" doesn't seem to have much of an effect either. Maybe I just don't have a sensitive enough bum, but I really couldn't tell you a difference between these and your run of the mill baby wipes.
I'm a sucker for good marketing :/ it's a shame the wipes couldn't deliver."	&&&
Great for everything. From wiping bottoms to spills to baby girls face. They are thicker than some brands which makes you need less of them at a time and they last longer. They also dont have that funky "unscented" scent that some brands have. Love huggies wipes.	&&&
I love how these wipes are so much thicker than pampers. They smell much better too.	&&&
Boogie wipes are Awesome the kids love using them , the saline helps dry out those runny noses . Plus they have scented ones that smell really good .	&&&
These little wipes are super lifesavers. When you need to grab something quick there easy to grab. Great during flu season cleaning of knobs and doorways.	&&&
love these wipes	&&&
I love these wipes because they are basically good for anything and everything.	&&&
Doesn't even warm the wipes! Went back to using our old one. Bummed we wasted the money on this!	&&&
These wipes get everything off of my little guy's face. Even the crusty and hard to get stuff. The wipes can be used more than once because they are bigger than other wipes and they are soft on his face without chaffing. We love them!	&&&
The perfect wipes for CPAP masks. No fragrance or perfumes to irritate skin, and the size of each wipe is small enough so you don't feel like you're wasting a full wipe (like the large clorox wipes you buy in the grocery store).	&&&
I wipe everything down with these. With a 2 year old at home things can get pretty messy so these wipes make cleaning things up a lot easier.	&&&
too expensive....use CVS brand	&&&
These wipes are almost a mix between Huggies and Target brand wipes. They don't rip apart like the Huggies wipes, but they aren't overly stretchy like the Target brand wipes. Overall I am pleasantly surprised and will probably be switching to these from now on.	&&&
Worked excellent for my daughter to take of her dance makeup.	&&&
These little cloths are nice, soft, nice smelling, and leave your bum feeling cleaner.	&&&
Smells great, and cruelty free...but doesn't take off my mascara.	&&&
I love Huggies wipes! They have never let me down. Strong, soft and get the job done. Best buy!	&&&
I keep these wipes in my pump bag that I take to work. I'm a nurse and things can get a bit sweaty when you are running around all day. These help me feel fresh before a pumping session and make clean up easy after. The wipes are soft on tender areas as well.	&&&
Love them all my family uses them.	&&&
These are so cool and innovative! My favorite by far is the Malibu Honeysuckle. Definitely reminds me of the California shore, warm and toasty and sun soaked! Oahu is my mom's favorite, she loves gardenia and soft, powdery scents, so I gave her the Oahu and I'm keeping the Malibu and Miami for myself. Would highly recommend this for all the travelers out there.	&&&
I really like these makeup remover wipes. They're gentle on sensitive skin, smell good, and clean off my makeup easily. They don't balance my combination skin as much as some wipes do, so sometimes I still feel like I need to use a toner, but they don't make me break out.	&&&
Pampers sensitive wipes are great for really bad dirty diapers. They are gentle but get the area clean.	&&&
This brand has my favorite wipes they are gentle and the most moist wipes I have seen so far I will keep buying	&&&
I love Huggies wipes! They have just the right amount of moisture compared to other brands that are too saturated.	&&&
This was a gift, but it looks like it works.	&&&
I started using them a while ago, in my kitchen. I really like the wipes that have the scrub side, for those caked on messes. The only downside I see it that they leave a streaky, film on my appliances. Otherwise, they're fantastic.	&&&
I really liked these soft skin wipes the best of all the huggies wipes. It didn't hurt my daughter's skin and she liked these wipes better than the other wipes which were much rougher.	&&&
The best. Perfect size sheets, sturdy in use, handy dispenser.	&&&
These wipes are gentle, non irritating and excellent for everyday use.	&&&
I recommend these wipes. Not as good as the pampers sensitive, but they don't irritate my babies bottom. They really do mean "one and done". Very sturdy wipes without irritating the skin.	&&&
Awesome wipes! Cleans even caked-on flour and gritted-in coffee grounds. I use the citrus scent mostly - pleasant, less chemical-y.	&&&
Pretty awesome product. There have been some copy-cat versions of this product, but I prefer the original because they are basically scent free and keep your skin feeling normal after use. I buy the individually wrapped wipes. They are a little more expensive, but they fit in your wallet, pocket, gym back, etc. and don't dry out.	&&&
tons of wipes	&&&
I purchased these because I needed the convenience of a cleaning wipe, but didn't want the antibacterial ingredients or the strong smell and chemicals used in all of the other cleaning wipes. Contrary to what most people think, it is not necessary to use antibacterial cleaners and it's actually harmful to your immune system and causes antibiotic resistant bacteria. So when I saw these available, I decided to give them a try. They don't have an overly strong smell, which I appreciate. They are not antibacterial, and I feel much more comfortable using these than the overly strong ones. I use them to wipe down the sink, toilet, and pretty much anywhere else I feel like using it. My only real complaint is that they are more expensive than the other brands of cleaning wipes, which is a bit disappointing. I do appreciate the company bringing us a more natural alternative.	&&&
I've used these wipes for all three of my children and find them to be the best available. When my children do get diaper rashes, these wipes clean effectively and gently. They are on the more expensive side compared to other brands, but worth the extra money!	&&&
LOVE THESE WIPES!	&&&
I love these! Super useful household item, esp if you have children running around. (this was you don't use all you rbaby wipes cleaning up messes ;) )	&&&
I got to try these for FREE from SMILEY360. These wipes work great, i would highly recommend them if you are pregnant or just need a little relief. they are nice and cooling and thick and very easy to use and gentle. They have a better scent than the original wipes that are standard from this brand and in my opinion much better than before. If you are a woman it doesn't hurt to have some in the house just in case. They are not too expenisve and they come in handy.	&&&
The mop covers are good quality, fit my mop perfectly! They came quickly and were reasonably priced.	&&&
Bes wipes to ever	&&&
"This was another Prime Now win for me. I've been using Burt's Bees Pink Grapefruit Facial Cleansing Towelettes, but I ran out, and when I went to order some through Prime Now, it seemed Amazon was out of stock. So I tried these by Simple instead, primarily due to the reasonable price.

I've got fairly sensitive skin, especially in the eye area, but I do wear makeup to work every day, and that requires a quick cleansing each night. Since I'm way too lazy to go through a whole skincare routine, I'm pretty devoted to just using wipes. These wipes by Simple have virtually no scent and don't irritate my skin, and they're also great at removing even my waterproof mascara without too much rubbing. Immediately after using them, my face sort of feels like it has some kind of sticky residue on it, but after a minute to dry, it feels perfectly clean. Weird.

I still prefer the ones by Burt's, if for nothing else than the grapefruit scent and the immediately clean feeling, but these Simple wipes work well and will most likely be my back-up whenever I can't find my favorite."	&&&
These are the best baby wipes on the market!!	&&&
Great product, keeps the baby's skin from being irritated by all the additional chemicals in your typical wipes. Ive seen a huge reduction in rashes	&&&
These wipes are my favorite out of all the ones that ive tried. I got a baby and a toddler, so we go through a lot. I love that they are super gentle and soft, yet can handle big messes. Only thing that could be better is the smell. They are supposed to be scent free but they still smell. Its not offensive or anything just not very plesant in my opinion.	&&&
"Great quality soft cotton cloths. Very effective at cleaning even the most explosive of poops! None of the weird chemicals of baby wipes. Very useful and don't lose their softness as you launder."	&&&
Favorite wipe, very cheap but very durable and dependable. Very comparable to one of the more expensive brand wipes.	&&&
I love using these wipes on my daughter...she loves that they have mickey on the package and I love that the wipes get her bottom nice and clean with just 1 or 2 wipes!	&&&
As noted in previous reviews, this product has a tendency to be a bit too dry. (Which is worrisome, since it starts out dispensing from the center of the roll so it's only going to get drier) Product was delivered, packaged, and sealed well but the cloths are not quite wet enough to really wipe away stains/dirt or daily eye crud. (Think of it as a lot drier than an individually packaged hand-e-wipe) And I find myself rushing to wipe what little I can before it dries out further in seconds. The cloths are a good 6" x 7" about half the size of my Earthbath Grooming Wipes, of the same soft texture, and are fairly odorless. I have a medium, short hair dog with no eye or ear ailments so this is suitable for her, as a quick eye wipe and big enough for quick ear wipes. However, if you have a dog that tears often, or has longer fur, or is a small dog.. then this may not suit your needs.	&&&
Soft and doesn't irritate my baby's sensitive skin. Comparable to Target wipes. Cheaper when bought through Subscribe & Save.	&&&
I really love these wipes. They feel natural and don't have that disgusting fake chemical smell.	&&&
Not flushable. Plumbing bill was $475 and due to these wipes.	&&&
I love these wipes. Great for many emergencies	&&&
It did a good job at removing makeup. But, for me and my touchy skin, it was really irritating. I'd wipe away my makeup and my face would be red for some time after. I ended up returning. The reaction and burn was too much for me. ):	&&&
I am using these wipes but the sheets are poor quality. The leave some little particles in baby.	&&&
My 11 month old came down with a nasty cold. After 2 days of wiping his poor little nose dry every 10 minutes, I realized I needed to find something that would be gentle and effective for cleaning up his runny nose. I ventured out and bought a pack of these wipes and let me say- what a life saver. Unlike tissues, these little miracles are moistened to help keep baby's nose from chaffing. And unlike wipes, there is aloe to help soothe and heal his nose. I recommend this to anyone dealing with a young child with a runny nose.	&&&
These are SO NICE! I love the texture! They have little circles that are raised/embossed to create a more cloth-like feel. Better than any brand I've tried so far, let alone the excellent price. Hands' down, the best wipes out there!	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes and also buy the travel packs. I purchase them bi-monthly on the Amazon subscribe and save. They are very moist, durable material, good for sensitive skin which allows me to use them in my son's face, and last longer than expected considering how often I use them to wipe down baby toys as well.	&&&
We've been using these wipes since our daughter was born in May of this year and they have done a good job. It only takes two or maybe three (for the really bad diapers) to get the job done. They aren't too wet, and aren't too dry. They seem to have the perfect texture to keep my bebs bum comfy 	&&&
I really like robe wipes. We are always on the go and the binky falls all over the place so it's great to have these in the diaper bag!	&&&
GREAT BUY	&&&
Great alternative to regular baby wipes! Less expensive and without all the harsh chemicals. My baby rarely gets rashes and I attribute it to these wipes. I just put them in a plastic container and soak in filtered water. I also cut them in half becuase they are rather large, and then I have twice as many. Great product!	&&&
I thought these were so stupid when I first saw them. First cold.....they're necessary! No red, chapped nose. Gets the job done fast.	&&&
LOVE THEM FOR MYSELF - EXCELLENT !!!!!!!!!!	&&&
Love these for travel!	&&&
"i really enjoy this wipes. it help me lot.
Whether you're experiencing hemorrhoids for the first time or you're a long-time sufferer, NEW Preparation H? Medicated Wipes for Women are a must-have for cooling, soothing relief.
it really does what it says."	&&&
Great product for all surfaces. Pleasant odor . Wrap around a mop and do the floors. Long and solid track record. Should be a must for office and home.	&&&
Should have tried these before I purchased them. Love the concept - was exactly what I was looking for in that sense - plant-based effective, easy-to-use household cleaner, BUT I do not care for the smell. So much so my husband and I both tend to avoid these wipes. Will purchase a different type in the future.	&&&
"They dont have an opening in the top to pull out the wipes, you have to fully remove and put in a wipe container... what a hassle.

THE ACTUAL WIPES, are great on my daughters bumm."	&&&
Have been using these for a week. Was initially hesitant about using cloth wipes, but am doing the laundry for diapers anyway, so figured I'd give it a shot. When I first opened the package, my initial reaction was ... "these are just washcloths"... but they're actually much more plush than the baby washcloths you'll find in the baby sections without being giant like the full sized washcloths. Am mixing water with a few drops of tea tree oil and lavender (both doterra, not that it matters) and then saturating the wipes and placing them in the wipes warmer. The wipes are used within 24 hours, so am not having issues with any smell etc that I've read about. Also ordered a small spray bottle (Fantasea Fine Mist Spray Bottle, 2.5 Ounce) for like $2.50 to carry in diaper bag to use these on the go. I think these are worth it over just using washcloths,- they're definitely much softer on my 5 week old's bum than the muchkins brand we have. Happy with the purchase and am ordering a second batch now to use while the others are in the wash :)	&&&
Simple makes great products and sell them at an awesome price. I have no interest in trying any other facial wipe, these work absolutely great and they don't break me out, which is a common problem I have with face wipes.	&&&
I have never bought Huggies brand wipes before. These are horrible. They rip when I try to take one out of the package. They also don't clean very well. Will not buy again.	&&&
I used this for cleaning parts of my breast pump. The wipes are very small and they do tend to dry out if you don't use them fast enough, but you can't beat the price.	&&&
We have used Pampers Sensitive wipes since the beginning to protect his sensitive skin! Love the wetness to them. Sometimes I have to use more wipes than I would like because they are a little thin and stick together, but overall we have been so pleased!	&&&
I have a cat and dog and these wipes are great for cleaning up their messes. It just simplifies cleaning so much.	&&&
These wipes work great! We keep them handy for our refrigerator, stove, and microwave. They keep them all looking as good as new! They're aren't too costly either.	&&&
these wipes are great! my husband uses them and i also like to have them for my three year old niece and my five year old son. they are great for children who have recently stopped useing diapers. a good way for them to wipe themselves better	&&&
I received this product via Smiley360 for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I so hate creams and how messy they are so these discreet medicated wipes are wonderful. They have a great scent and work wonderful, if you are on the go you can throw it in your purse! Great Product!	&&&
Don't mind these wipes, however they are very moisturized so they tear easily and it takes more of them to clean up the mess.	&&&
I'm pregnant with my first child and I will be using these wipes! I've heard so many good reviews about them. I already have boxes for when my little girl comes!	&&&
I love these wipes. The smell and the way it cleans. I use these everywhere.	&&&
These are thicker and sturdier than Huggies wipes.	&&&
We love the wipes themselves, but will return to the wipes in tubs (Especially because there is no price difference)	&&&
These sensitive baby wipes are not only super soft for babies bottoms but they get the job done with ONE wipe most products you need 2-4 wipes but these are thick and leave a clean feeling after use! Highly recommend!	&&&
"I'm kind of struggling to review these wipes. I've got one in diapers and one nearly potty trained and I've used a lot of wipes to clean these poop-machines' bottoms over the last 3 years. I have a complicated relationship with wipes.
Both kids have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes with the wrong diaper or wipe. I've had bad luck previously when trying wipes other than the Huggies Simply Clean we normally use. These wipes caused no problems with their skin at all. Big positive for me.
The ingredients are great. I appreciate that the product page indicates what each ingredient does and where it's sourced from.
The price is comparable to our preferred brand.
They are very strong and do a great job with most diaper cleanups as well as random face/hands/feet cleanups.
The only problem I have with the Elements is, like others reviewers have mentioned, that the texture tends to be a bit ""slick,"" for lack of a better term. This isn't a problem for wet diapers, a dirty face, etc but it makes some #2 diaper changes a bit difficult. I got a case of these wipes over a month ago and did a totally non-scientific comparison of how long a tub of Elements lasted us versus a tub of our preferred brand. It seems that we do need to use more Elements wipes than the Huggies; a tub of Elements lasted about 6 days while the Huggies lasted about 8. With wet diapers and many of the #2 diapers a wipe or two did the job just fine. With particularly messy #2 diapers, though, the Elements tended to kind of slide through the mess which necessitated using more wipes to do what two Huggies would normally handle.

So, I think this comes down to slightly more money overall for wipes that have better ingredients. They create a bit more waste due to needing to use more, but I have no idea if that's counteracted by better ingredient sourcing and other environmental considerations.
I'm going to use the rest of the case before deciding whether we'll switch or not, but I do like a lot of things about the Elements wipes. I've got another 2 years of diapers ahead of me (oh god....) so I'll be watching how this brand evolves over time!"	&&&
These facial wipes are so refreshing. I use them at night before going to sleep and in the morning before applying make-up to my face. It keeps my face moisturized after applying my make-up on.	&&&
These are great wipes! Love the feel and the smell of them.	&&&
I always try to keep some Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the house. They are a must have if you have children.	&&&
In my opinion, these are the best wipes out there. I don't really like Pampers diapers, but these are the only wipes I buy.	&&&
I love Clorox wipes...I love the way they smell and that they are easy to use. They are great for quick clean ups or wiping down an entire counter. I will have to say they could be easier to pull out of the container sometimes they tend to get stuck.	&&&
I absolutely love these underarm wipes! They smell divine, and the scent is strong and it lasts. I am an elementary school PE teacher, and especially on hot days, I do not end the day as fresh as I started. These wipes are great for a quick refresh when I have errands to run after work or I'm meeting up with friends.	&&&
Bit pricey but worth it.	&&&
very good wipes I love the huggies natural care and only wipe I ues	&&&
Works great	&&&
I love how soft and strong these wipes are! They are great for all kinds of messes. The refill packs are perfect for using to fill the wipes warmer and other containers.	&&&
As a new mom , I tend to over protect my son on all the things that I buy him. One item that I can always rely on are these wonderful wipes . I prefer using any pampers wipes then the companies out there. Pampers are high quality with great pricing!	&&&
These are a must have with kids, it's like a hot knife cutting through those boogers. Stock up for the winter months.	&&&
I first saw these wipes being used in the various New York City Hospital emergency rooms. I absolutely cannot stand fragrances that most wipes put off. These only smell like rubbing alcohol and they evaporate very quickly. I have ordered these for my apartment and they make for a quick and sterile clean up in the bathroom, countertops, sink, floors, etc. Also great to reduce the germs on commonly touched items like refrigerator/microwave handles, phones, keyboards, door knobs, and more! Since buying these I will say that I've found I can ward off colds much easier!	&&&
Just got this warmer and haven't tried it yet it's loaded and plugged in ...waiting now for a dirty diaper ....while waiting I went to my little girls room and tried the light and it did the job of lighting up my little girls changing table and then I went ahead and checked the wipes and they are warm so the wipe warmer is not getting Spartan kicked! It's actually welcome to stay! Yeah....my baby girl is only 6 days old and she let daddy know those cold wipes are no good cold and I wasn't having that ! :|	&&&
Absolutely Horrible. Although they are soft these wipes are so thin and flimsy that you will need to use two to get the job done. They are also smaller than other brands that I have used. I expected more from this name brand. I will not buy Pampers Baby Wipes ever again and I do not recommend them others.	&&&
Since I love the Organyc pads, I thought I'd try their wipes. I assumed they would be fragrance free, like the pads are. However they are perfumed with strong, floral fragrance that would only give me a headache. Organyc is a company that makes more natural feminine products available–the wipes should be fragrance free.	&&&
This is a good product. I just wanted it to be a little longer, to avoid having to use two sheets at a time.	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I use pampers sensitive wipes but compared to seventh generation wipes I love the sg wipes more. They are thicker and I feel clean better. My only complaint is I wish they were bigger.	&&&
Nice unscented wipes. A little dry, but I think that's because they're a "no-rinse" type that you can use without having to wash your face afterwards. Being asthmatic, the fact that these are unscented is a life saver!	&&&
I will just start off by saying, I'm all for cloth wipes and diapers. They are my go to. These wipes are great! They feel thicker and durable like a cloth wipe. There isn't all the harsh chemicals that can irritate baby's skin. In a pinch for cleaning up messy hands or when on a road trip these come in handy! "I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
These wipes make me feel much more secure while on the monthly flow . I carry them in my makeup bag and my purses . They smell good too but I just like using them whenever to make you feel clean all the time	&&&
these wipes have worked best for my child by not irritating his skin or causing break outs. they are strong and hold together making it easy to clean the biggest mess. always the kind I like to have on hand for my child.	&&&
i love my huggies wipes and i use them as make up remover wipes too not just on my babies bum	&&&
"I have been use this wipes since i had my baby, that was 9 mnths ago and I love them...
I love the smell and I never have a problem with my baby skin.. The price is really good and the quality is the best..."	&&&
Works great on my eye glasses. I use them on my smart phone too.	&&&
These wipes are awesome. We use it everywhere in our home, from kitchen to bathroom to toilet to clean floor to disinfect surfaces, toys, stove, counter top, dining table....almost everything in our house. These clean very well. Smell is also good and gives a clean feeling.	&&&
"I think that the Boogie Wipes are great. My son hates when I use regular tissues to clean his bose. And now this time of year, with all of the pollen around, we are cleaning his nose a lot more. And he doesn't seem to mind when we use the Boogie Wipes."	&&&
So thin, feels like cheap wipes. I prefer Huggies Natural Care.	&&&
Love these wipes! No funky odor, clean up great and affordable! Much easier buying refills ahead of time or stocking up when on sale.	&&&
Love these wipes for my little boy!! We use them at diaper changes, but also to clean up messes. Also great for removing make up.	&&&
"Really liked the price and the quickness in receiving this product.
I will reorder from you when I need to refill.
GREAT JOB !!!!!!!!"	&&&
A must have for little noses! Smell good and gently cleans baby's nose. I keep these in the house during cold season	&&&
these are the best. don't fall apart, get the job done. excellent buy.	&&&
These are the best wipes we've tried! Our daughter has very sensitive skin and since we started using these wipes we've noticed less skin irritation and no more diaper rash!	&&&
I definitely recommend these for new moms, they work great & I like the texture to it & how sturdy they are. One of the best!	&&&
They're great	&&&
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. If you are unfortunate enough to have to use these, then you picked the right product. I get them from time to time and these really really help with the pain, and burning. There is nothing worse than having to feel that. You can take these on the go with out messy creams. Im glad I was able to try this product. I even like this better than Preparation H's own cream.	&&&
I carry these in my purse. Very lightweight and always handy when shopping. I wipe my hands after touching items, and if needed, wipe the cart if the store doesn't have any wipes available.	&&&
This is my favorite brand of wipes. There are thick and very moist. They are also affordable.	&&&
Great wipes!!	&&&
My baby loves this wipes and so do I, they do sometimes rip apart if you pack to many in the container	&&&
"I am in love with these wipes. They are thick, cottony, absorbent, and smell as close to heaven as a baby's heiney is going to get. Most other wipes I find to be too plasticky - like wiping baby's bottom with a grocery bag. Ew. These, however, basically live up to their name. Although, since starting solids, it's been more like ""Two or Three and Done"" ;) To the folks saying they rip in half while pulling the wipe out of the box, here's a tip I found handy: before getting a wipe out, I take off my Hulk hands and put on my normal human being hands. ;) Seriously, I don't think I've ever ripped one during ""normal"" usage.

In addition to cleaning up brown bombs, these wipes are also great for freshening baby (or yourself, in a pinch!) up midday. Stinky sour milk neck rolls? No more, with these wipes. Your baby's chubby rolls will be almost as squeaky clean as they are after a bath when you use these things. Instead of buying that Swarovski encrusted paci holder, buy two or three cases of these instead. Your sanity will thank you!"	&&&
These are absolutely the best thing the cleaning industry has ever came up with. My daughter loves these and are easy for her to clean with.	&&&
I don't have a child but I purchase this box for my facial tissue. I get the facial tissue package than I put them in this durable box..It so convenient and looks very nice on my make up counter.	&&&
Terrible! I ordered three cases and they are different than they were last month. It's like trying to wipe off poop with a cotton ball. You can imagine how well that works. So irritating. Being notified before they ship that the product has changed would be really nice.	&&&
These wipes come with a tub. For me the only problem is that my 2 year old broke the tub. The tape on a few of the packages tore in multiple spots where the opening is and it is hard to keep it closed. But, if we had the container that would not be an issue. The wipes are very soft and I like that. Overall, they have been great.	&&&
These hand wipes are the best! I keep packages in the car and in my bag. They come in very handy with kids around. Great for quick wipe-ups, too. They have a nice, clean and fresh sent and don't leave a residue on your skin. There are several wipes to a package and the packaging is slim so they are perfect for a purse or glove compartment. These are great and I don't leave home without them!	&&&
I have used a lot of wipes with having four children. These are vet absorbent. I absolutely love the smell. My youngest (3months) has sensitive skin, We have no issues using these wipes! I'm in love. Would definitely recommend them to everyone!	&&&
After a few baby showers, we had a ton of different kinds of wipes. We tried a little of all of them when our son was born, but I quickly favored these sensitive wipes. They feel thicker and more soft, like its a porous material instead of just sliding over his skin. I've reordered this size twice now!	&&&
Great wipes, just wish there were few ingredients like Waterwipes, but they are my favorite wipes to use!	&&&
Far and away my favorite wipes! Worth it to get the name brand and not the Costco ones IMO. And I do the rewards on pampers.com.	&&&
While I find these wipes to be very effective at removing makeup, I'm very surprised that these are marketed for sensitive skin and described as "kind to skin." I have sensitive skin, and I found these to be very abrasive and harsh. It really irritated my face and I had to immediately stop using them. Personally, I prefer to use a regular makeup wipe and exfoliate using a gentle scrub applied separately. Maybe combining the two products just wasn't a good idea.	&&&
The exfoliating ones are awesome. I love how you can choose between the soft side and the scrubby side. Having the option lets me choose either side or both sides, depending on whatever I feel like using. And so few wipes out there are truly exfoliating -- you never really get the same clean feeling that these wipes provide.	&&&
I have now used these wipes in my Honda Element and our Toyota Prius and wow these things really do make the interior look brand new! They are incredibly easy to use, just get the wipe started through the hole in the lid and you're off and running. There is no weird film or smearing from these wipes. The new car scent is also a nice plus, it's not too strong. Like any of these types of wipes, even if you close the lid, they still tend to lose some moisture. I ended up using about half the container for the 2 cars so I would definitely use them up before they dried out. I will definitely be buying these in the future for the cars!	&&&
I love these wipes! I use them everywhere home, work, and the car. They smell great and leave surfaces shiny and smooth. There is no sticky residue or filmy layers left behind only a clean surface. I take the travel packs with me everywhere.	&&&
Megs housecleaning easy	&&&
i personally love everything about these wipes smell, texture, and they clean just as perfect as any other huggie brand item. i use only these for my son and intend to ony purchase these with my soon to be born daughter.	&&&
In general, I have no complaints about any pampers wipes. You cannot go wrong with whichever one you choose. If I had to choose one for my daughter it would be the sensitive wipes because of her sensitive skin. I have no had issues using other wipes from pampers, but I love the sensitive ones. They are substantial wipes, with a clean, fresh smell! They do not pull apart or rip like other brands, and they get the job done. My favorite by far!!	&&&
These wipes are fantastic for anyone who has kids that are extremely sensitive. We've been using them for a few days now and have not seen any sign of rash. My daughter doesn't seem to mind them either. I like how they come in packs and that they're easy to take out of the packaging. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This is a really great product.	&&&
Nice amount of wipes for the price. You don't get this much using diapers.com	&&&
Best wipes on the market. The only ones we use. Thick, soft, and just the right amount of wetness. And now the package comes with the large containers of wipes and a few of the little travel size ones as well. The wipes do have a slightly off putting smell to them that I don't particularly like but it doesn't resonate on whatever you use it on so it isn't that big of a issue. I use them to clean pretty much everything! Great for diaper changes and dusting your living room!	&&&
They are extremely soft and gentle and I use them to clean my daughter's face as well. I haven't had any issues with mold, like some reviewers have said. The top wipes do tend to start drying out if the package sits too long though since all the water sits at the bottom; I simply flip my stash over every week or so and that fixes the issue!	&&&
dont buy....i had this warmer on my registry. the wipes are difficult to remove with one hand, as you change the babies diaper. the warmer dries out the wipes. it leaks water snd as a result ruined my brand new dresser with water marks! so upset	&&&
These wipes are okay. I don't like the material used and I feel like I go through them more than other brands I have used. I probably won't buy again.	&&&
One of those "why did no one think of this sooner" products. I recommend this to all of my Mommy friends, and is a great practical gift for baby shower gifts. Cute designs, easy to use, and durable. It would get five stars, but I actually do not prefer Huggies wipes and fill mine with a different brand.	&&&
Seem to work great. The 200-pack that I ordered was delivered as three boxed of 60 wipes plus an additional 20 in a zip-lock plastic pouch.	&&&
I use these boogie wipes when my kids have dried up boogies and snots in the morning and it cleans them right up! My kids hate it but I love it.	&&&
I absolutely love Huggies diapers. I prefer the little movers because they have the extra velcro piece for extra security.	&&&
I love this saline wipes. The are just perfect when my son is nose is congested. Helps get the mucus out with harming his nose.	&&&
These are the best baby wipes on the market - and a great price too! They are sturdy, do a great job, and are very soft for baby.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes because they are thick and don't tear coming out of the box.	&&&
These are the only wipes I use and I love them! They are thick enough I don't have to use more than one (usually...) and my baby has almost never had diaper rash. Once I tried using another brand's "sensitive" wipes and his poor bottom was red in an hour. The price point for these when using subscribe and save is awesome. I will probably use these for all my babies!	&&&
These are great wipes and at a great price.	&&&
I use boogie wipes 24'7 when my son has a cold. It helps rid hi of the crusty and wet boogers that always follow with a bad cold. The saline really helps prevent a rash and pain when wiping his nose.	&&&
Horrible wipes. They do not hold moisture and they stink.	&&&
Huggies wipes are the best! Would never purchase another brand and as a daycare provider I go through tons of wipes.	&&&
Canister arrived and wipes were completely dry regardless of "guaranteed wipes stay moist" on the canister.	&&&
I was told to not buy the wipes that the spray is better. But both are great.	&&&
We love these wipes. These are the wipes we send to our daycare for them to use on her face and when changing diapers. They love the scent and we love how gentle they are.	&&&
"I didn't really notice it helping in a medicated way. I did like that I felt fresh and clean.
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own"	&&&
Overall we loved the natural care wipes. They were thick and gentle. The only thing we didn't love was that when you pulled one wipe you usually got multiple wipes at once. This is a hassle when you are using one hand to hold a wiggly baby and the other to grab wipes. Over all great.	&&&
I have really sensitive skin and this product is great for removing makeup and cleaning the skin. It's really gentle and refreshing!	&&&
As stated.	&&&
Living in Texas with an outdoor job, using these to clean sweaty areas eliminates heat rashes with regular continued use two-three times a day.	&&&
These wipes are great! Soft, clean well, and smell great!	&&&
Love these puppy wipes. I have a baby Malti-poo and when I take her outside for a walk in the mornings her little fury paws get all wet and dirty. After she comes inside I wipe her paws off with these and shes all clean again plus the wipes smell good. Would highly recommend for cleaning of that genitals, mouth or paws.	&&&
We like them better than the Bausch & Lomb, though both are good. These seem to work better and leave less film. Great for tablets and phones too!	&&&
I have 2 kids a 12 year and a 2 year old and have never used anything other than Huggies! Love them for everything!!!!	&&&
I do not like these at all. I usually buy pampers wipes but there was coupon saving on this so I decided to try it. Firstly the wipes are connected!!! Which makes it hard when I'm holding my babys legs and I have to pull a wipe and wave my hand to tear it. Also they aren't as soft as pampers. I'll give credit when its deserved- they are packaged well and when u only use half the bag the other half is wrapped well so it shouldnt dry out. Overall will go back to using pamper wipes	&&&
These wipes make cleaning the house more easier. Also saves you money in the long run. They work great to not only do the disinfect but keep counters and etc. Sparkly clean!	&&&
I use these for everything. My roommates can be a tad bit messy side. So the clorox wipes are a quick answer to all my problems. They don't leave an icky residue either, but if there is some dust around where you use them, they just smear that stuff around. They don't pick it up at all.	&&&
These work great in the bathroom for makeup removal and quick cleanup of the sink. They arent as baby soft as the other versions of huggies wipes but nothing noticable enough to pay more for the other ones.	&&&
Love these! Are great to have around, are good for quick and easy clean up! Great to clean up dust and used every time before a room inspection and passed!	&&&
Be careful because the towels will dry out if not properly sealed and then enclosed in large ziplock-type bag. I like that the towels have the lightly abrasive side to get some of the tougher bugs and road junk.	&&&
So natural and it was the only wipe to help clear up my babies little red butt! Love how it only has two ingredients!	&&&
I was expecting atleast 50 wipes but there were only few. & and i found it half price on other place. Other wise product is good quality.	&&&
Clorox Wipes are my go to for quick and easy cleaning! They take care of the mess and are leave my house smelling fresh and clean! I keep them in my desk at the office and in most rooms at home! A must have for those who have to clean on the go!	&&&
Pampers Baby Fresh Wipes are the only ones I'll ever use on any of my little ones! I love how gentle they are on the skin and they clean baby's bottom thoroughly. They also aren't heavily scented or irritating to the baby. I've definitely recommended these wipes to all the mommies to be that I know just as they were recommended to me, love them!	&&&
Very efficient seller. Gets my Five Stars.	&&&
I love the refreshing feel of these wipes! Perfect for a summer day when I just need to freshen up because of sweating.	&&&
I use this product like package recommends or when I have pain.	&&&
Really soft and good quality.	&&&
Love These! These washcloths are so soft and they get softer when wet! Just what I needed for my baby's face. Now I don't have to worry about washing my baby with a ruff cloth! The packaging was cute as well!	&&&
I've been using these for two years, usually when I don't have an opportunity to shower. I feel very clean afterward. The smell reminds me of Lysol. But the smell is not an issue for me, as it dies away in minutes. The small size seemed weird at first, but they don't tear or shred. So, I just keep it opened up and don't let it bunch up. You get used to it. It is nice to find a product that works this well.	&&&
"They are very rough and are more like exfoliating wipes. They don't really take any of my make up of. But they are great for exfoliating your face! They also dried out really fast and there's no
Cover to close the package(it's a piece of tape) they aren't something I would buy again."	&&&
I buy these All the time. They are great and so quick and easy to Clean up messes! They are just like The Lysol wipes but much more affordable!	&&&
Not a fan. These wipes are super wet. You have to follow the wipe with another cloth to actually clean your computer, unless you're a fan of leaving streaks over your screen.	&&&
I love Pampers wipes. They're very moist compared to other brands, which I like because it cleans better in my opinion.	&&&
Not a fan of name brand wipes, I find the generic at target or Walmart are much more durable and overall more pleasant.	&&&
The boogie wipes work well at taking off boogies but they have a strong scent that I wish they wouldn't have. I use them when my baby is sick and I feel like the scent is unnecessary.	&&&
As described and great item.	&&&
These Lens Cloth Wipes work wonderful at cleaning our glasses and computers. I highly recommend this brand.	&&&
I really like this product. I have 5 boys and i used huggies for all of this. I wont use anything else.	&&&
I really don't use any other wipes than these, although sometimes we use the natural care. Great, usually only takes one to clean a mess. No complaints. But I really don't have too much comparison to make. They work well for the price and leave my sensitive skinned daughter rash free so that is all I care about!	&&&
These wipes smelled really nice and I would buy them again!	&&&
Working great for flannel baby wipes.	&&&
Best. Wipes. Ever!!! These are all I use on my baby's bottom. They are thick enough I only have to use one wipe (usually) and they are free of all the other junk you find in many brands of wipes. My baby has never had diaper rash except for one time when I tried to use a sensitive type of wipe from another brand. I love these and they are a staple on my subscribe and save!	&&&
I Love these wipes, I have a very sensitive baby with eczema, these are the only wipes we have found that don't cause her to have a diaper rash.	&&&
I wasn't too worried about clorox wipes but after enough complaints, I went to find something that would be safer for kids and found these. The people that use them, love them. They are worth the extra cash to ensure safety	&&&
These wipes are soft enough and yet tough enough to do the job. They don't fall apart with use and flush relatively easy in our Toto toilets.	&&&
We have been using exclusively Huggies wipes since shortly after my daughter was born. They are thick and have the perfect amount of moisture to clean easily, using less wipes. They're perfect for her sensitive skin and even though she is potty trained now, we still buy them for her since sometimes TP is irritating to her skin. I also love them in place of makeup remover!	&&&
This is great for cloth wipes! I just replaced mine from 2.5 years ago. Make sure to keep the insert moist so your wipes don't brown.	&&&
These wipes were too rough for my face. I love exfoliating products, but these wipes are so harsh and do little to remove makeup.	&&&
These glass wipes are great. No spraying, no newspaper or paper towel wiping; just wipe nice and done. Work great on car Windows, too.	&&&
These wipes ended up being hypoallergenic for our family and we have TONS of allergies. We are allergic to pretty much everything from oats to citrus, mint to lavender, MSG to red dye.... I mean none of us can find even a toothpaste we can use.... so finding a baby wipes that none of us were allergic to was QUITE the challenge. These wipes worked perfectly for my newborn. There were no rashes, hives, coughs, runny noses, asthma attacks, or migraines on the baby or adults. Plus, our baby has had NO diaper rash. The only issue i have is they don't tear apart easily with one hand... you need to place them in a dispenser to help tear them apart.	&&&
The Pampers Sensitive wipes were all I used for my son's first month of life, and I absolutely loved them. Other brands just aren't as good to me. These were "one wipe and done" wipes whereas other brands have taken two or three wipes. And with my son's skin being sensitive, these didn't irritate his bottom. Well worth the money.	&&&
"It heats up the wipes perfectly! The only thing is instructions say to moist the pad every three days when I suggest two days because day three my wipe pad that retains moisture was practically burnt."	&&&
I think that the Boogie Wipes are great. My son hates when I use regular tissues to clean his bose. And now this time of year, with all of the pollen around, we are cleaning his nose a lot more. And he doesn't seem to mind when we use the Boogie Wipes.	&&&
We have two little ones and use a lot of wipes. We tried switching from Pampers to Huggies simply because you get more for your money. However, we are very disappointed! Huggies wipes tear very easily and are difficult to pull out of the wipe container. Will be switching back to Pampers.	&&&
I lice these wipes when I don't feel like washing my face or if I need to take makeup off. I don't think they are the best but they are far from the worst.	&&&
As a flushable wipe, it works: which is the only reason it gets two stars. My problem with this product is that it is a prime example of marketing gone amok. This product is exactly the same as a baby wipe, right down to the baby powder scent (which is so incredibly lazy. The least they could have done to make this product match its slick marketing is give the wipes a masculine scent, but they didn't even bother to do that). They simply took baby wipes, renamed them with a masculine name, made a box with masculine colors, put them into individual pouches and charge you many times more than the original baby wipes. For that reason I would not recommend anyone purchase these.	&&&
Dude wipes. Convenient useful. Dude. Aloe Vitamin E. Single pack. Enough said.	&&&
I must admit that I purchased these out of accident thinking they were going to be face wipes! They smell incredible and I wish they came in travel sized to keep in my purse so I wouldn't have to risk spilling out a bottle of lotion!	&&&
Love these wipes. They are so gentle on my daughters skin and they smell great too. Have always used these and I will continue to.	&&&
I get these wipes i rather get the box they are less expensive and have alot of bags they actually last a good amount of time	&&&
After seeing a lot of rave reviews here and elsewhere, I wonder if I've got a bad batch. These were some of the driest makeup wipes I've ever tried. Because they were so dry, I had a hard time removing makeup, even simple eyeshadow. Forget about any full coverage foundation, waterproof mascara, or eyeliner--this barely scratched the surface of my makeup. In addition to its ineffectiveness, the sce...read morent was horrible. I prefer non-scented products but I can deal with most scents. This one however, is even worse than the Neutrogena wipes. It's been years since I used the Neutrogena scent so it might have improved and people have different preferences but this one smells like moldy paper. The positive things about this wipe is that it's softer than some, retains its shape well, the ingredients list is short, and doesn't dry out my skin (doesn't contain drying alcohols). This is good if you're wearing light makeup or just looking for a midday refresher but if you're wearing a full face of makeup, I recommend you pass on this lest you be left disappointed.	&&&
"We bought a box of these a month before our son was born and have just run out of them at 11 weeks of use (I know we've used a few wipes from individually sold containers). They are well worth the price and you know you'll get your value out of them (assuming you're wiping baby booties every day). Not a bit of diaper rash on my little man yet and all we've used is this brand of wipes. Five stars from an enthused new father.

Thank you,
Marcus Strait"	&&&
These are the best wipes ever!! They clean up great. No harsh chemicals in them or anything like that. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
We have used several different brands of wipes and these hands down are our favorite.	&&&
Works as advertised as far as wipes go but the dispensing of the wipes needs serious work, I'm 5-6 deep and each one has torn/fallen apart when carefully trying to get one out (they usually come out in pairs, torn), Better options out there.	&&&
"The wipes are good for the money, but the seal tends to come open so the top few can dry out.

You may want to put them in a box from another wipes manufacturer."	&&&
"Dries fast, no fragrance, kills germs .
So easy to pack and use one each time.
Great product!"	&&&
These wipes are very convenient and are the perfect size for the diaper bag. The scent is nice and not too overwhelming.	&&&
My wife has to wipe below with wipes but lately she started having an allergic reaction to the big name shelf products. Despite not being to flush these, my wife love these wipes, no more breakouts for her.	&&&
I have tried so many makeup remover wipes and while most work the same way, these do not dry out my face or leave my face feeling tight.	&&&
These are the most reliable wipes that I have found. They don't irritate my children's skin and are durable (which is crucial, assuming you don't want a tear in the wipe and the...exported product all over your hands.)	&&&
Great product, Easy to use wonderful job, but I wish the wipes were a little thicker and a bit larger, I would buy it again,	&&&
Whipes are harsher than most, consistently caused redness, and are not as strong as other brands in same price range.	&&&
Super soft wipes! plus i LOVE that they are fragrance free!!!	&&&
"We bought these as a gift for a friend, but have also used the same brand. They arrive promptly and in-tact. These are decent wipes, very strong, dispense properly, and do not have a strong smell. My complaint would be that something marketed as ""natural clean"", you would expect to see more natural ingredients and hopefully greener packaging.

As you can see, most of the ingredients are NOT natural and they do contain fragrance:
WATER, CITRIC ACID, PEG?40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, SODIUM CITRATE, BENZYL
ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, XANTHAN GUM, SODIUM BENZOATE, DISODIUM EDTA, BIS?PEG/PPG?16/16 PEG/PPG?16/16
DIMETHICONE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, FRAGRANCE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, VITAMIN E ACETATE

Futhermore, The following ingredients present in the finished product are listed on state right-to-know lists or state worker exposure lists:
Benzyl Alcohol (CAS# 100–51– 6) MA, MN, PA
Glycerin (CAS# 56-81-5) CA, IN, KY, MA, NJ, MN,OR, PA,TN
Phenoxyethanol (CAS 122-99-6) NJ, PA, RI

Overall, these wipes work fine, and if the ingredients do not concern you, then they are a good wipe for the price. However, if you are looking for something ""natural"", there are better options out there for your baby."	&&&
I'm 22, combination skin, mild to moderate acne on my forehead, nose, and chin. I use this every day! It was my first time trying it and now I'll never use anything else. It smells great, works great, and as an added bonus even improved my acne. Now my skin is perfectly clear!	&&&
I love the fresh feeling it gives you when your done, ease of comfort and great fragrance, it also comes in great easy to open and easy hideable packages to take anywhere with you rather your at home or on the go, everyone should most defiently try this new product out, thanks Prep H for the new improved product	&&&
Huggies wipes are by far the best wipes I have found yet, they are nice and thick and are so soft. they don't have too much wetness too them where its just smearing the mess around, it is the perfect comibination....never again would I use other brands	&&&
These wipes are def. A+ in my book! They smell great and leave baby's/your skin feeling clean (not sticky). I think they work well for everything, even for around the house quick needs. Wiping hands, faces, feet, basically everything works for these wipes. We keep a pack in our master bathroom even. They always come in handy!	&&&
Super soft and help keep baby clean even with his sensitive skin! I often use them to clean my hands as well!	&&&
While these may not be as strong as the original, they are still a good wipe. I also love that they are really gluten free so as a celiac they are good for me to use for antibacterial needs as well as regular hand wipes.	&&&
Loved both cases and very very very cheap	&&&
Great product and quick shipment!!	&&&
Warks very good! Thank you .	&&&
huggies is the best wipe brand i know ! my son loves them ! wipes everything iff smoothly and leaves a clean smell on babys butt = ) on top of that you can easily clean off a mess with two wipes ! very good quality ! i love them !	&&&
I was worried about ordering these because of some of the reviews. I ordered them anyways and I'm very happy I did. They seem durable and gentle on baby's skin. I thought they were gonna rip once I tried to get them out of the plastic container like huggies wipes usually do, but they didn't! I also like that they come with resealable packaging. Overall I would definitely recommend these. They seem better than the ones I've bought in store.	&&&
They are wipes... For dudes. Enough said.	&&&
These wipes are a lifesaver & a must have! They have a nice sent to them & the packaging is great. Honestly, you need to try them out and truly see for yourself how great these wipes are! Note: I was sent this product for review from a product review company. But all opinions are my own.	&&&
I think I like these wipes the most. The actually "bubble up" while your wiping your kid. I feel like it giving my kiddo a really good scrubbing :)	&&&
I have a 7 year old with bad allergies & sticky fingers all the time! These wipes come in great hand.	&&&
The wipes are great for sensitive skin. The only downside I found is that they are much thinner and smaller than other wipes I have used. Not only do I have to use more of them, but I have gotten baby poop on my hands on more than one occasion. I know it comes with the territory, but a little more material would be nice.	&&&
Our little one's now 16 month-old and it was our first time purchasing these wipes. We have been using them for the past couple of weeks now and we actually really like them. Wipes seem to be thinner than other brand ones but they wipe really well and leaves fresh feeling/scent.	&&&
Best wipes! These wipes are thick and you dont have to worry about them tearing or having to use multiple wipes.	&&&
My glass is clean and it only took 500 pounds of packaging to do so.	&&&
Big full packs. 1 outside, 1 in the kitchen and 1 in the bath. I was so happy to see that these were big and full.	&&&
"Don't get me wrong, these work fine... Except for the weird fact there I cannot find the list of ingredients that are in these wipes. This is absolutely a deal breaker for me. I can find the ingredients in other dog wipes, but not these?

I checked the factory website (useless), the package itself (nothing), and tried looking for them via Google. Nothing. Its very strange and I'm starting to think these are just overpriced, glorified tissues with aloe vera.

No thanks, I rather not purchase this ""Made in China"" product."	&&&
These wipes make cleaning, disinfecting, and life so much easier!! Without these wipes cleaning would involve two or three extra steps	&&&
These are so soft and worked wonderful! Definitely recommend.	&&&
This tidies up the bathroom. No more ugly plastic packages of wipes sitting on the back shelf of the toilet. The top opens easily with a little push, and also closes easily. A weighted "press" is included which holds the wipes stack down while you select the top wipe. Easy, one-hand procedure. The unit has a rubber gasket attached to the lid which enables an air-tight closure (the wipes stay moist and don't dry out). Excellent design!	&&&
These wipes have gone downhill. I've been buying them for years but in the past couple months they have become soapy, paper-like thin, and difficult to remove from their container when in the middle of a diaper changing. Also this time I got sent a different package of wipes, so not sure why that happened.	&&&
"These are nice wipes for the dog's fur coat, but the problem is that I was looking for something to wipe off their feet after coming in the house on muddy days. These wipes are too rough and the solution is drying on the pads of their feet. If they are too drying on pads, I would never use on the butt or exposed belly skin!

They really are a strange firm texture. I won't buy again."	&&&
These work great for phone screens, sun glasses, eye glasses, and laptop screens. I am not using them very fast though, so I started handing them out to friends and family. They really like them too!	&&&
Rather annoyed with my purchase! The wipes dispenser does not work and I have to end up taking the whole thing apart, to get a single wipe out, rather pointless for a handy container. Would never buy again, as it also leaves streaks on my computer screen? even after saying anti streak!	&&&
I love these. They are so gentle. I like to use cotton balls and water when my baby has a diaper rash, but it's hard at daycare and if we are out and about. These are the perfect solution. I only wish I had known about them when my baby was first born because we didn't use any wipes at all for the first few months.	&&&
I keep by the CPAP for quick and easy to wipe clean immediately after removing the mask. Citrus fragrance great!	&&&
Selling at a local Optometrist office for a buck a piece. Defiantly worth the buy.	&&&
I love Huggies wipes. They are thicker than other brands and smell amazing. I don't feel like I have to use a billion of them to clean up my baby's messes. I tried different brands but Huggies are for us!	&&&
The Pampers sensitive wipes are great. They have no scent and are gentle on baby's skin.	&&&
"I love the boogie wipes and this refill container is great to keep them in!"	&&&
great value	&&&
The liquid on the wipes made my hands sticky.	&&&
Every time I used these wipes on my son he would get a rash. There way to dry to rub anything off.	&&&
It has very nice color and design, also its bassinet pad is really useful.	&&&
Such a good deal!	&&&
I love FAB products usually, but these aren't thrilling me. They're very foamy, and I feel like they leave a residue on my face so I want to wash it again after I use them. They don't sting me the way they do some other people, but I don't think they cleanse my face all that well. I won't rebuy them and I doubt I'll finish using the package I have.	&&&
Convenient and fast	&&&
I love these wipes for my sensitive/acne prone skin. They feel refreshing on your skin and the smell is even nice (after getting used to it). The only problem is that they do not remove stubborn eye makeup at all but I have other stuff to remove that.	&&&
I've tested a number of different wipes in an attempt to find a favorite, and this is definitely not it. The wipes themselves work well enough to remove oil & dirt from the skin but, as the title says, the scent is absolutely overpowering. I didn't mind the smell at first, but then I noticed it would not go away and, after a while, began to actually make me nauseous. The only time I used it, I had to re-wash my face with soap and a washcloth just to get rid of the smell. I threw away the rest of the pack because I couldn't imagine using these again. I keep a pack of wipes at work for mid-day refreshes, but using these in that environment would stink up the entire office! Perhaps their other scents aren't quite so pungent, but stay away from these.	&&&
Great wipes! Good quality and liked the refills. I stopped my S&S because I found another type of Huggies wipes for cheaper.	&&&
I love Huggies wipes have always used with my daughter because they are the thickest and softest we have tried pretty much every brand..with my son we made the mistake and used the Walmart brand and when our daughter was born we have spent the little extra for Huggies wipes these smell so awesome! We thought there wasn't much difference between these and pampers but there is! Pampers rip so easy and pull apart and stretch... Def tell all moms just use Huggies wipes ANY of them are awesome!!!	&&&
Absolutely love Lysol wipes because they are a wipe I know and trust that will take away all the germs and keep my countertops, toilet and any other surface I want clean!	&&&
I like Huggies wipes because they're thick but they tear a bit easily when pulling them out of the dispenser.	&&&
I really like these wipes for those lazy nights I don't feel like washing my face (I keep them right in my nightstand). They smell amazing and do not leave a weird residue. However, I do not believe they get off 100% of my makeup like washing with cleanser does. This is great for a quick refresh on a clean face as well.	&&&
Best wipes ever!!! They are so perfect for baby's soft skin and I feel good using them knowing they are natural for my baby girl	&&&
The wipes were so wet! They leave my baby dripping so before I put her diaper on, I have to dry her off.	&&&
The non-textured side works great. However, like many other reviewers have pointed out, the textured side is WAY too scratchy. This has to be damaging?! I carefully used that side one time, and now I only use the non-textured side. Next time I will buy the non-textured version.	&&&
These are perfect for on-the-go sanitation and priced just right. Put these little babies in all my bags to wipes the little germs away. Nice size the scent is not too powerful.	&&&
i love this brand of wipes and the sentsitive one are always great they never give my baby a rash and they are a very cost friendly choice and seem to last longer than more expesive brands	&&&
A little pricy but all and all Great product and a must have when out of the house.	&&&
I like these wipes a lot. They have a mild, inoffensive odor. They are just moist enough. And they don't leave your hands sticky. Individual packaging convenient for travel. Made in the US.	&&&
I've been buying these wipes for my kids they love them wipes their bums clean and doesn't get their hands dirty because the wipe are nice and thick GREAT PROUDUCT!!!	&&&
I clean houses for a living. I typically use swiffer dusters for ease of use, but they are expensive and don't always work well enough to meet my standards (pampering my clients). THESE dust wipes are the greatest thing since Mr Clean Magic Erasers. They pick up every speck of dust, are easy to use, and one goes a long, long way. They're currently hard to find in stores in my area, so I love that Amazon has them.	&&&
Love the wipes but the opening changed to just an adhesive covering instead of plastic. I find it harder to keep them closed.	&&&
I find these wipes a little dry, not enough moisture	&&&
Love these clorox wipes they are so handy when kids spill or theres a little dirty mess. They kill germs too which is a plus.	&&&
Good materials sturdy lid opens easily by pressing down on the top. AWESOME!	&&&
I have been using these wipes since my daughter has been born, she is now 7 months. There not to thick and there not ruff on her bottom. My finance has bought some huggies brand and didn't like them at all. Those were way to thick. I am completely satisfied with the Pampers wipes.	&&&
I like Huggies baby wipes. They have just the right amount of moisture and just the perfect thickness to get the job done!	&&&
"I don't know where I would be without Kandoo wipes. My son who is potty trained uses these to clean up every time. They are made to be flushable (most wipes are not meant to be flushed, look at your wipes) they don't clog or back up and they are very effective. My son uses them easily and with subscribe and save you can get these delivered to your door without going anywhere and for an exceptional price.

I expect that my youngest will be using them soon. They have become a staple in our house.
Kristen"	&&&
Most effective.	&&&
I generally like Sephora products, but I found these wipes did not remove all of my make-up. I would always need to wash my face after to remove what the wipes left behind.	&&&
These sometimes dry out before opened. Keep that in mind and make sure you have several on hand, just in case. Otherwise, they are my favorite wipes because they don't leave a residue on your hands.	&&&
I have used this product for years. I have rosacea and oily skin and I use these wipes to cleans my eyelids, while working later in the day, to sooth a burning sensation and refresh them. Good for a general face wash. At home I simply wash my face more often. I prefer the Citrus as I like the smell.	&&&
Huggies Natural Care Wipes are a staple in our home. From the gentle and soft texture when changing my children's diapers to the durability of the wipes when cleaning up spills and tiny hands....This is the best all around wipe know to mom!! I'm in LOVE!	&&&
There's a reason why schools and teachers request Clorox wipes! Because it does the job it promises to! I've never used a Clorox wipe that I haven't loved!	&&&
Best wipes I've ever used! For one thing, the smell is mild and fresh. However, I like that these sheets are bigger than others. All I've bought before were 6"x7". These are 7"x8". This means (to me, anyway) I can cover 1/3 more area and feel that the disinfectant will effectively cover that much more. I ordered these as a trial to compare them to other brands. These win on all counts! The special scrubbing side of these is time-saving; you don't have to stop and scrape every three seconds. As far as I can tell they don't scratch, but they do a great clean-up job. I use them in my kitchen, bathroom and store room. I clean my cat's litter box without having to let it sit wi that I highly recommend them!th bleach water. I have two litter boxes and two scoops because I had always left the one in bleach water while filling and using the other. I don't have to do it that way, now.. I'm subscribing to the 240 count, (pk of 3x80 wipes) which gives me a lower cost per sheet, plus an added discount. It comes to $9.47 for 240 sheets! Compared to what I've paid for others, it's a great bargain, even if it didn't have the special qualities I mentioned. You've probably figured out by now	&&&
wow where to start on these awesome wipes!! first i love that each wipe is wrapped individually and you can throw a few in your purse, your car, and have them in your desk or locker at work. plus they are so easy to use and you don't have to worry about using a cream or carrying around a tube that can be so messy and awkward. these give relief and have a pleasant smell that doesnt remind of meds and i don't have to worry about a cream ruining my undergarments or making me more uncomfortable and feeling gross. also these are great after a day at the beach or outside on a really hot day to help give a cooling and refreshment. i deff give these a high recommendation for all to at least try and see if they are a fit you!! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. i am a member of smiley360!!!!!!!!!	&&&
I have tried a couple of different baby wipes, whether I was babysitting, or just watching my nieces and nephews, and I was always having dry skin or my hands would smell weird from those baby wipes. Recently, I purchased HUGGIES Natural Care wipes for my boyfriend's son and, I must say, I am SOLD! I love these wipes! I have sensitive skin, and so they're even great for me! My hands don't dry out while changing baby and I can also use them on my face to remove my eye makeup. It's definitely a win-win and I will never go to anything else :) Thank you, Huggies!!	&&&
I bought these hoping I would love them but unfortunately I cannot stand the scent. It is a very strong cucumber smell. I am also on Epiduo for acne and these really burn my skin unlike other makeup wipes. I now use these for make up that gets on my hands. I wouldn't recommend them.	&&&
These are the best wipes ever! And the price is amazing!!!! I don't have a Costco membership but I was able to order online and get them shipped to my home. That's awesome!!!!!!	&&&
Tried other bamboo baby washcloths for my daughter. My wife and i agree that by far Bamboo Organics is the premium choice. Not only the washcloths are premium, but also the customer service is received. The free e-book was welcoming surprised.	&&&
Have tried several brands and although I wanted to like these, they were too wet to the point of disintegrating in your hand, which created friction and irritation for our child. In the end we settled on Babyganics wipes, which have many of the same qualities but are just a bit smoother on sensitive skin.	&&&
Would buy again	&&&
A must have for the bathroom, I don't feel clean without these, I'm not sure why wet wipes aren't in every bathroom by now considering we are a culture obsessed with hygiene.	&&&
"These wipes make applying the dash protectant extremely easy, but depending on the texture of the surface it might leave behind lint so you might need a follow-up wipe with a microfiber if your surface pulls apart the wipe. Also, if your dash is textured you might need to go over it a couple times to get down in the recesses in order to make it all uniformly shiny. Any spot you miss is going to look very bad in comparison to protected areas.

A few comments about UV protection, the windows in cars are tempered glass, and the front window is multi-layered in all cars, meaning it already has near 100% UV protection. The side windows are probably only 70% in most vehicles which don't have special glass, so don't expect this to help the dash a lot. Main function is it looks nice.

Has a slight VOC smell like a new car, but isn't overpowering. If you apply it, give your car an hour or so to air out before driving. Also, this product is very slippery after applied, do not put this on your steering wheel or anything else that requires a secure grip.

One complaint I have had with these products is they evaporate over time and leave a film on the windshield. I will update my review if I notice anything like that after a couple months."	&&&
My body laughs at deodorant. hahaha. I don't get funky, but I will have a huge wet armpit within 5 minutes after putting on a shirt. buttonups, forget it! I tried a sample of these, and I was perfectly dry all day and honestly, half way into the next day. I bought a box. the first few worked just like the sample. It felt weird cuz u KNOW you want to sweat, but that 19% barrier wasnt letting it happen, lol. U could feel the blockage! Then about a week in, my body figured out how to break it. I would sweat like an hour after I put it on, wet shirts again! I was so disappointed and thought my body must be crazy! but then after u dab it dry or let it dry, you are dry again for the whooole day. its like.. my body just HAS to overpower it to let it know it can, then it calms down and lets the medetate work. I dunno, but IT DOES WORK! AMAZINGLY! I now use for 2 days, with a swipe of regular deodorant midway thru day 2, or toggle, wipe day/deodorant day. Great purchase. expensive for deodorant, but worth it to me. DRY UNDERARMS are worth it! great brand too. wanna try a few other things.	&&&
These wipes smelled horrible!	&&&
Keeps the baby wipes in my warmer from drying out.	&&&
I have 2 kids in diapers so we go through a ton of wipes. Member's Mark are the best wipes on the market. They aren't too wet and aren't too dry and for. 2/wipe, you can't go wrong. They come in packs of 10-with 100 in a pack. My only issue is that when I want to pull out one, about 3 cone out, which is fine for someone like me who changes a lot of diapers. I absolutely love how they have free shipping. Basically, this product ships right to my front door in just a few days.	&&&
It appeared, according to the ad, that a plastic tub in which to place the wipes came with this order. I did not receive a tub, which I specifically wanted. But the wipes are doing what wipes are suppose to do.	&&&
These wipes do their job. I ordered these wipes shortly after having my son. I love the smell and the fact that they are hypoallergenic. My son has very sensitive skin and other wipe brands that I have bought break out his skin. Most wipes say that they are hypoallergenic but still break him out. These did not and they still smell nice. I was very pleased with this purchase. I also like the packaging. Some baby wipe packaging is set up to where the wipes are packed so tight and rip when you pull them out. These were packaged so that you can take them out easily and also make it easier to put in a wipe container. All in all this was a great purchase and I plan on purchasing again soon because we go through wipes quickly in a house with two boys.	&&&
I rec'd a sample of Seventh Generation Free & Clear Wipes for purposes of my review. I thought they worked better than other brands. They're thick and I found them to be quite durable. I liked the cute duck designs. These wipes didn't fray/tear/leave lint behind like some other brands do. My daughter tends to have very sensitive skin on her butt - other wipes have caused skin irritations/rash. We had no trouble w/ these wipes. These wipes are also good for wiping up sticky faces/hands too. I would purchase this again as it works well and I found them to work better than other brands I've tried. We're very happy these wipes don't contain harmful chemicals/parabens. Great choice for those w/ sensitive skin or wanting to use wipes that are Free & Clear.	&&&
I like using boogie wipes because they clean my son's boogie's away with ease and the handy dispenser that it comes in helps me as well. I dont have to search around for the boogie wipes, and when I've used up the pack in the dispenser i can just replace it.	&&&
I clean my makeup off as best I can with baby-wipes and then get the rest off with these wipes. They help minimize break-outs too!	&&&
These are the most gentle makeup removing wipes I've ever tried! It doesn't burn my face like other wipes. It takes off all my makeup even my mascara!!! It's a must have	&&&
"These anti-bacterial wipes work well. They are a small enough package they fit nicely into your carry on bag as well as into the glove compartment of your car. This package includes several smaller packages, so you can stash them where you need them most. I travelled on my last trip with them and they are moist and are able to clean off dirt smudges and messes. These towelettes are not absorbant, so you wouldn't use them to clean up spills, just to get dirt - like germs - off of whatever you're touching.

*I purchased this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and candid opinion about its form and function*"	&&&
I loooooove these wipes. I use them to clean everything, they also smell great. They do however sometimes irritate my hands when I use them too much ..	&&&
Just as good as the overpriced brand name wipes	&&&
Incredible product that matches its timeless logo. I use it around the house, working on cars, and bicycling.I recommend it highly. Now I wonder if the BBQ rib place would mind if I carry a few in after I eat those ribs slathered in sauce! So cool. and a Monkey!	&&&
Love the smell and quality of Pampers baby wipes. I buy everything from Amazon cause the shipping is very fast!	&&&
I went to the store and bought every type of wipe I could find just to see which I liked best. For my LO I find that these are my favorites because they're not too expensive but still do a good job. I will say that they do tear, as someone else pointed out, but I like how thick they are so that I don't have to use more wipes to do the job.	&&&
Great wipes	&&&
I have used the liquid in the past but since receiving the wipes I will continue using the wipes as they are much easier to use. The wipes have a pleasing scent. Because I don't use them every day I turn the package over to keep the Vagisil Anti-itch Medicated Wipes moist. I highly recommend this product.	&&&
Super thick and gentle to use on baby's bum. You don't need many, my daughter doesn't complain at all when i use these.	&&&
Wyp all does not mean wyp all, this stuff is rough on the bunghole people	&&&
I absolutely LOVE these! They come in handy at the daycare when the poor kiddos have crusty noses after naps! I also use them when I am sick with a sinus infection!	&&&
Work great without leaving my babies little noses red and raw. One of the first items I buy when I notice Cold symptoms or allergies	&&&
It's the only wipes I will buy. So gentle on my baby's bum.	&&&
I received this product free for the purpose of my review. That being said my opinion is 100% mine :) These wipes are awesome! Very easy and convenient to use. They smell fresh and clean and work really well.	&&&
I use clorox wipes daily and it not only cleans up the mess but it leaves a refreshing smell. Love these especially the lemon scent! I would recommend these to anyone!	&&&
i've bought wipes that were dry before and these have just enough moisture. they're also not horribly priced.	&&&
These are some of the best flushable wipes out there! They don't agitate, and always come in a handy carrier	&&&
These wipes work very well and clean messes in a flash, but I do not like the smell AT ALL. Functionally they work great if you can get past the smell.	&&&
These work great! My daughter loves to help clean, and these are easier than dealing with the spray. I can just give her a wipe and she goes to town on those dust bunnies! lol	&&&
I've tried other wipes and nothing matches up to Pampers. They aren't super thick like other brands so it makes it easier to clean a baby's bottom. I typically buy mine in bulk. It saves some money!	&&&
I use these for cleaning everything! You do get a lot, but the price is right and it's not like they will go bad or anything. I use them for kitchen, bathrooms and all over the house (great for dusting/disinfecting most surfaces).	&&&
Love Huggies wipes! They are so think & durable. They are guaranteed to clean up the accident.	&&&
Not only do I love these wipes, but my baby loves them too! She seems to enjoy it when I clean her mouth with these, so I'm not complaining! I actually knew about these years ago when I used to work for a pediatric dentist. He always recommended these wipes to mothers of infants. He is a great guy and a great dentist, so I figured I should probably take his advice.	&&&
"I gave 2 stars because they do actually work for the most part. I have used a variety of different dyes to dye my hair bright red/pinkish red and these wipes have nearly always been able to remove the dye from my skin.

However, I do not have sensitive skin and never have. These wipes seem to chemically burn my skin, leaving irritated scabby marks on my neck and face. Because of this, I can't really say I would recommend them."	&&&
I love these Lysol wipes. Even better that I can buy them in bulk. I keep a container in every bathroom in my home and also in my kitchen. They make cleaning a breeze and have a nice lemon smell. One wipe can clean up a very large mess!	&&&
I have been ordering these wipes on the Subscribe and Save plan for a few years. With my latest shipment, I noticed these wipes had a new packaging. I immediately noticed how small these were compared to the yellow ones we used to get. The first time I tried them, I was amazed how awful these wipes were. I thought Amazon perhaps sent me the wrong item, they were so noticeably different from the old wipes. Sadly, it looks like these are the new wipes. Do you know those little sterile alcohol wipe single packs you find at the doctor's office, or perhaps in a first aid kit? These have the same kind of texture (wipe, and formula). It says it does not have alcohol, but it somehow feels like it does. It does not glide easily on the skin when wiping, and I feel like I have to grab two wipes and wad them together in order to be able to hold on to them when wiping (or else they would slip between my fingers making the task way too difficult). What the heck, Earth's Best? More like Earth's worst. Booooooooooooo.	&&&
These lenses wipes are very moist (almost wet) which really cleans lenses very easily. I've used other brands that the wipes were almost dry...these are the BEST I've ever used...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!	&&&
The butt wipes for the couch are pretty small and run out of 'juice' fairly quickly but the do a good job of keeping the leather conditioned. We've re-bought this item a few times so far. I wish they did a better job of masking scuffs, but that's relatively minor.	&&&
I love how practical these wipes are. I have one in the car when my purse when in my diaper bag and they work great for any wiping reason. And they smell absolutely amazing as well! My little one used to cringe when I would wipe her nose and now she asks that I would wipe it with the "grape wipe".	&&&
Love these wipes started using with my son we now have a newborn little girl and I'm continuing with these wipes they have been the best for my family.	&&&
I bought the sensitive wipes a week ago and I love them. I was buying pampers and I thought I would try these. I am so glad I did. They are tough and get the job done very well. I am not going back to pampers I am sticking with kandoo..	&&&
These wipes are even more gentle than the regular Prep H wipes and I can tell a big difference having switched back. This is not an area I want to cut corners with and will happily pay a little more for the specific benefits.	&&&
I bought this a month ago and my family is glad I did! The wipes are easy to use, my kids can go to the bathroom with confidence knowing they can do it themselves! That is something I can stand behind.	&&&
My whole family uses these wipes! I always have a package in the bathroom for everyone to use and stay fresh and clean!!	&&&
"Good specially in winter to keep baby warm"	&&&
These are so handy to have in my purse. Traveling with them is a must - sticky messes no more.Smaller size fits well in purse also.	&&&
I have used these for a few years. They get all if my makeup (full face) off. I love that the proceeds go to saving the polar bears. I'm not a HUGE fan of using some of the the argan oil products, but these are amazing!	&&&
We use these around the house everyday but my daughter gets the most use out of these at college. She literally wipes down everything in her dorm with them.	&&&
Love these wipes!	&&&
These wipes work great, they clean my baby up really well!	&&&
I didn't give them five stars because they are a little expensive	&&&
I work in fast food so my makeup (foundation and waterproof mascara) ALWAYS cake on to my face and at the end if the day it is very oily, after trying multiple different make up removing wipes these are by far the best out there! Not only does it get the mascara off completely, it's fast and makes me face and mind feel refreshed! I will definitely continue to buy these!	&&&
"Well, I was loving these close to a 5 star review when on our west coast trip, 1 of the cases tore. After less than 1 month of use! Just lateral to the zipper. Is it possible I was a bit aggressive trying to open the case? Possible- I don't think more so than say the average pull on a tight zipper x 1.5. So naturally I'm miffed that it's torn & now is not only no longer leak- proof but also allows my wipes to dry out faster and harder to open due to the lack of tension on the zipper.
Bummer. Major bummer. Zip locks cost less and last a lot longer. I think ours average about 4-6 months? But no handy dispenser. Whatever. No leaks. Go ziplock!
Edit: I contacted customer service & got a reply the same day. It fell under their 90 day guarantee, and Nicole, owner, kindly sent me a replacement immediately. Nice. So I'll up to 3 stars for now... And see how these do in next few months. If it was a fluke I'll be sure to amend this review."	&&&
I have ordered these before and this is my recommended brand of makeup wipes.	&&&
Have used these on our baby since she was born. Works great when sensitive baby wipes aren't an option because baby broke out in a rash.	&&&
I love them. The only reason I didn't give it the five stars, is because they are difficult to open without using scissors. Hopefully they will resolve this issue.	&&&
A newborn's bottom is extremely soft and sensitive. Therefore, it's best that you use a wipe that isn't going to irritate that. Or worse, hurt the baby! Wipes must be soft so it won't scratch the baby's bottom, and these wipes are perfect for that!	&&&
These are the best wipes ever!!! I was a loyal Huggies fan but I have converted!!!!	&&&
Excellent! Good quality wipes and not to wet. I'm definitely a repeat customer!	&&&
It's ok but I have to add water often. They dry out a lot faster than the pampers brand. I do like the thinkness of the wipes.	&&&
They are just like Huggies wipes. I like them enough to by them but still prefer the softness of pampers when we have the money.	&&&
I use this product daily. I love that it is natural, no chemicals. It smells wonderful and lasts all day. I recommend this product for women concerned with aluminum in there deodorant.	&&&
These wipes seem to be the only wipes that don't cause my granddaughter to get a rash. This is all I buy now.	&&&
These wipes leave me feeling clean and fresh. They are great for armpits as well. I would recommend them to someone looking for wipes to carry as a way to freshen up on the go. I received this product from influenster in return for my honest and unbiased opinion.	&&&
Love These!!Wouldn't Use Any Other Wipes!!!Excellent Price!!!	&&&
Wipes for a reasonable price.	&&&
I love cleaning with Clorox wipes. I keep a container in the bathroom for a quick clean up. I also use them in the kitchen, door knobs, and many other places	&&&
I LOVE THESE WIPES, THEY ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER BRANDS. MY DAUGHTER GOT A LOT OF RASHES WITH OTHER BRANDS AND WITH THESE ONES WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES.	&&&
These are great for my daughter, who wears glasses. She packs a handful in her backpack, has a handful in her bedside table and more in the kitchen drawer. They are wet enough for her to really get her glasses sparkling clean and she prefers them over all of the other kinds we've tried.	&&&
Simple Face wipes are great for sensitive skin. They are soothing on the skin but also wonderfully transportable. So easy to take them camping or on a long hike. These also take off make-up with no fuss. No need to add water just pull out a wipe and it is ready.	&&&
Great wipes, esp. for travel, just priced a little high.	&&&
Worth of money I generally use this wipes stays wet even after its opened scent is little punch smell but good for Baby.	&&&
Extremely disappointed with these wipes. I have a 17 month old and have gone through many different types of wipes for her sensitive skin, so have a lot to compare to. These are by far the worst. They're too small - I have to use much more for one diaper change than other wipes (like pampers or seventh generation). They don't easily come out of the package - which is really hard when you have a squirming baby and you need to work quickly. They leave lint behind - little pieces of the wipe, like bad toilet paper. I do not recommend and will not purchase again.	&&&
I have a six year old and three year old. These wipes are a must have at our house. I have tried other brands and the qualty is just not there! We live Kandoo!	&&&
I really love Huggies brand wipes. These hold up well and do not rip when using. I use these for more than just my baby and clean a lot of things in my house with them and they are super nice. They are so soft but strong. I have used other brands as well and these and Amazon Elements are my favorite.	&&&
Switched when other wipes were giving our child diaper rash. So far no more diaper rash but only time will tell.	&&&
The best wipes I've found! I really love these! This is my 2nd child we've chosen to use huggies wipes with.	&&&
Love this huge box of wipes. They are stronger therefore use fewer wipes.	&&&
These sensitive wipes are great. They do not irritate my son's skin as some other wipes did. They are an awesome value for the price. I was a bit skeptical since it was a relatively new product and Amazon was branching out into making baby products when I first considered them, but I am glad I made the purchase.	&&&
I bought these Kandoo Wipes at my local pharmacy and really enjoykeeping them in my car for all the unexpected issues that come our way. They are so convenient to have near by and have saved me time and money in the long run.	&&&
I was really skeptical that these deodorant wipes would work for me because I sweat a lot more than the typical person... AND this was my 4th attempt at finding a natural deodorant that didn't stop working 2 hours in making me stink before my day even really started. These wipes smell amazing and keep me smelling great all day... I've even used them for the dreaded boob sweat. :-) Like another reviewer said though it's not an anti-perspirant, so you'll still sweat... but you won't stink! ;-) The price on Amazon is the most expensive I've seen them for! ULTA sells them for $10 and my Target just started selling them for $14.	&&&
I LOVE these wipes. I use them to clean in every room of my house. They are awesome for cleaning counter tops. I also use them to wipe down bathroom surfaces before company comes over. We actually buy these in bulk at Sam's Club. Can't get enough of them.	&&&
Work great for my hairless cat in between baths.	&&&
"Pros:
They clean well.
They are durable; one can do the job of two or three wipes from another brand.
They don't smell terrible.
Cons:
Lots of plastic waste, due to the containers.
Other Info: They're mailed in this packaging Amazon seems to be advertising. The packaging was really good, but not better than anything else I've received from Amazon."	&&&
Very good wipes at a great price.	&&&
So soft and absorbent!!! These are my go-to wipes. Love love love them.	&&&
I don't know what I'd do without these wipes. My son has been potty training and instead of using baby wipes and throwing in the trash can, we use these! No stink no mess!	&&&
One of the only wipes that don't leave my baby's sensitive skin red and irritated.	&&&
I love these and normally pay a ton for them at Whole Foods in a smaller quantity. The problem with this container is they dry out before you can use them all and I use them every single day.	&&&
Good product, but I typically use tissue or plain wipes just because they ate typically less expensive	&&&
Very dry wipes.	&&&
Great product."}},	&&&
These wipes have worked great for us! We go back and forth between these and the Seventh Generation wipes with the Honest Co diapers. Haven't had any issues with diaper rash.	&&&
These wipes are soft on skin and leave a clean fresh smell!	&&&
The wipes are OK. I do agree with other reviewers that the wipes seem to dry out fast. I don't think it's that big of an issue and I would still purchase them but the smell is just so awful. It is very strong and it does not smell good. It reminds me of a chemical smell and it isn't pleasant when wiping down surfaces. The smell also lingers on your hands until you wash them. I would not purchase this product again because of the smell.	&&&
I love these! I dont always buy them because you can use a warm baby wipe too, but I love that these are made with saline so they are clean to use and they clean up the mess fast.	&&&
I love the quality of Huggies wipes but I can't stand the smell of this line.	&&&
Not crazy about the soaping after feel these wipes leave behind however they do leave my baby girl fresh and clean.	&&&
Mold Growing on top of wipes when I received them. I bought the two pack and one container was fine but the other had mold growing and brown stuff on the wipes. Unfortunately I didn't notice it until later so it would have cost me as much as they are worth just to return them. Disappointed but after reading what is in these I probably wouldn't buy them again anyways.	&&&
Great product! We have a large tub of these for at home and smaller packs for on the go. They work and smell amazing. Definitely worth keeping a pack with you. I've even used them myself and enjoyed them.	&&&
I've tried all different types of wipes from store brand to other Huggies wipes. These are by far the softest, nicest feeling wipe I have ever bought. I would give these as a gift to anyone having a baby!!	&&&
If you love having Clorox wipes on hand this is great deal. The canister is the largest one I have found, you get 4 and I order them on subscribe and save and get an excellent discount. Love Amazon!	&&&
I cannot image having glasses and not using these. Ever since I bought my new glasses I have used these as the only item to clean my glasses and my glasses look brand new with NO Scratches. I had tried another brand on my other glasses and still had scratches on them, so I will always uses Zeiss Wipes from now on.	&&&
Smells nice, too to fragrantly at all esp. if you are trying to hide the stench of sweatiness. It is on the dry side and small. Takes two wipes for a quick refresher after a workout if you can't shower right away. Does not make me breakout	&&&
Simply the greatest baby product ever. So much gentler on little noses, doesn't leave them chapped and red like wipes or tissues. I keep the tall containers in each bathroom and little packs in the cars. I also keep one in her back pack for school. The grape is awesome, scent isn't overwhelming.	&&&
For a pregnant mom , this is a nice wipe relief my hemorrhoid pain and irritation . It smooth and cools on contact , really feel so relief .This wipes contain cucumber , aloe , chamomile smooth relief and itch , irritation from hemorrhoids . I like this excellent product. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
Use to love these -- the clean baby-fresh smell, and the great packaging. Wish the original scent was still available, but really wish the packaging wasn't re-designed. Maybe it is intended to be environmentally friendly, but it ruins the product. Hard to use, and rips easily. Like most Costco customers, I care about the environment and I recycle the packaging. This change was a bad idea.	&&&
After receiving many different wipes at my shower and trying them all out, these are the ones I have purchased since my daughter was an infant !	&&&
I could not imagine removing makeup without these wipes,Quick,easy and uncomplicated,These wipes are big and soft,the perfect prep for my Clarisonic,As I hate to see makeup on my brush,Love these	&&&
The lemon and lime blossom scent is great! I especially like it for use on the telephones at home and on my cell! With cold and flu season starting it's the time of year when I worry about spreading germs and disinfecting my home and car. I wiped down my car steering wheel, buttons and doors with these. Made my car smell great! I didn't expect that but when I went out a few hours later and opened the car door - wow! Very nice. I don't like that hospital/disinfectant smell that so many wipes leave behind, but this is very pleasant.	&&&
"Simply put, these wipes really work. I only use them to clean my eyeglasses and they are perfect for the task. They are sufficiently moistened and it takes me only a few seconds to clean my glasses. The box, which is cool because it opens to the front and can be used as a dispenser, contains 200 individually wrapped 2 1/4"" x 2"" wipes. I keep the dispenser box on my kitchen counter and put one or two in my pocket as I leave in the morning for use at work or in the car. This box of 200 lasts me about six months. At $15.99, the cost per packet comes out to about 8 cents a wipe. TIP: I recommend buying the 400 count box for the cost per wipe comes down to about 6 cents per wipe.

I hope this review helped. If it did, please click the yes button below."	&&&
"Strong scent, but the smell doesn't linger. I love the convenience and the power behind the cleanser. I used the wipes in the kitchen and bathroom.
Pros: Lemony scent
Effective cleanser
Cons: The wipes can get off track if you don't pull them out correctly. Just take 10 more seconds to pull them out slowly."	&&&
Does exactly what they're supposed to! Great wipes!	&&&
Waste of money. Red slider pops off of the case easily and the wipes do not stay moist. I have finally given up using it.	&&&
Necessity	&&&
Love these for the ingredients, but they do NOT easily dissolve in hot water. I usually break them up with my fingers and then shake the spray bottle like mad. The smell is nice and they work well, though. We use flannel wipes and just spray the baby and then use a wipe to clean/dry the skin rather than soaking the wipe, so these last for ages. It also helps that we use one of those olive oil sprayers so we always get the right amount.	&&&
"This is a must have and this is my second one, but not the last.
Congratulation OXO on a great design."	&&&
I have used these for about a month now and find them so much more convenient than lugging around a large travel package of wipes. They are easy to refill and stay very moist!	&&&
Nothing better than a clean foopy- absolutely nothing! Love this stuff.	&&&
I'm not crazy about the scent of these wipes, but they do a good job of getting the dirt off my dog when it's too early to give him a bath. He was rolling around in wet grass the other day with a neighbor's dog and I was able to get my pup pretty clean with just the wipes. Next time, I'm gonna look for unscented wipes so my dog doesn't smell like a funny combo of perfume and wet dog.	&&&
Some of the wipes left pieces behind but most of them were great!	&&&
These wipes are great! I love the dual side as I can exfoliate my skin, clean, and get moisture afterwards. I love that one side is smooth for makeup removal, the other has textured beads for facial cleansing and gentle exfoliation.	&&&
Received as a gift for baby shower.. Worst wipes I've used yet.. Gave my poor baby a horrible rash :( they also have a really weird texture, definitely never ever buying these & I don't recommend anyone else to either.	&&&
Uni-Solve Adhesive Remover is excellent for the removal of the sticky residue remaining after removing the various tapes used for continuous glucose monitoring, which ends up looking disgusting and dirty at the end of a cycle, due to clothing adhering to the adhesive. It works effortlessly.	&&&
I have 3 cats who, despite being regularly brushed, still manage to get fur on just about every surface. These wipes really grab hold of the fur (and any dust) and remove it; better than any other dry dusting cloth/wipe I've tried. They're great for wiping down my laptop keyboard, the fans on my husband's PC case, our satellite TV receiver and pretty much any other electronics product in the house. They're also good for a quick dusting if you need to do a hurried touch-up around the house. I'll definitely keep these in stock in the house!	&&&
"Ah, so THIS is how these work, and then they work wonders. The wipes arrive rolled tightly into the container, 20 of them. First try, I pulled one off the end, like peeling a wealthy roll of $1 bills. Worked OK but couldn't wrap it around the serving spoon I was cleaning or get a good grip. Looked again & saw each wrap is folded in half. Unfold, and voila! 5.5"" wide, 7.9' long, and I could put some sincere energy into cleaning that tarnished spoon.

The wipes were tested on a 6 pieces per setting, 10 setting sterling set, medium tarnished, six shamefully tarnished silver-plate & ornate serving spoons, a fairly shiny baroque repousse dish, and several silver plate serving dishes. I still have 1/2 of the wipes left. A single wipe shone about 4 pieces of silver---more for a plain item, less if the item is ornate.

Pros:
--easy to use, no pre-preparation
--smelled good to me, neutral-clean not perfumey
--handled the tarnished as well as shinier pieces

User Alerts:
--energy needed; a languid wipe won't do the trick so those with arthritis or wrist issues should be aware
--need to buff energetically with a soft dry cloth to bring up the shine (rinse first)--not for a long time but with energy

I'm really happy with results compared to a liquid polish and a pink cream polish both well known. This is a good value too!"	&&&
Even though my 18-month-old hates them, probably because the scent is so strong, they do the job of dissolving little snots in no time. Regular wipes cannot compare. Great product.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are perfect for my baby. I love huggies.	&&&
I had to use two wipes for one side of my mat, though it didn't really seem like it came clean. The next time I used the mat,my hands and feet were unusually sweaty.	&&&
I love these wipes because they hold up well with big messes! They smell good too and aren't harsh on baby's skin!	&&&
"Really like these moist wipes. They clean well, without leaving any residue. They have a fresh scent, yet you don't smell like bathroom deodorizer after use.

Product arrived quickly, earlier than expected in fact. Container works nicely."	&&&
Purchased it once when it was on sale. I like the packaging. Easy to open and close(like the costco baby wipes) Easy to carry around. No bulky hard plastic boxes. I like that there is no scent. I am still using this ( went through 3 packages). The only thing i dont like is when you wipe your hands with it parts of the wipe comes off on your hands and becomes very linty.	&&&
I love these wipes, i use them as femine wipes but not every day, and they last a very long.	&&&
Great product...will purchase again.	&&&
Tried it. Read the ingredient list. Read many online instructions for cleaning flat screens. I'm now using a homemade vinegar mixture. Works better and, according to some, better for the screen's surface.	&&&
"Wipe warmers aren't necessary, but are nice if you have one! Had one passed on to me from a friend, and we've used it pretty much every day since baby was born (he's now 13 months old). Not such a big deal in the summer, but during the winter months or night time diaper changes, baby will appreciate the warm wipes. Just imagine the shock of a cold wet wipe on your nether regions in the middle of the night and you might understand. ;)

These Ever-Fresh pillows are supposed to keep your wipes moist and from turning brown. Directions will tell you to rinse out and re-wet the pillow once a week, but I've found that I need to do it more often. I used to do it only when I needed to refill the wipes before, but realistically it needs to be done about twice a week for me. Otherwise, I will find a rock-hard pillow that's starting to turn brown towards the end of the week. It takes a few minutes to ""revive"" the pillow if you've let it dry out, and once it's been completely dried out, I find that it doesn't keep moist as long even when it's back to being in it's absorbent state. So, I would definitely re-wet the pillow more often than you think is necessary to keep a longer lifespan on it. I think they need to be replaced every 3 months, but I've replaced mine every 6. As long as you check often and rinse them out, there's no need to replace every 3. I've not had any problems with mold."	&&&
"So, in trying these wipes I attempted to clean multiple surfaces in my car and truck. The surfaces range from soft and hard vinyl with the some of the hard vinyl being smooth and some being textured. I like the scent of the wipes and they are convenient if you want to keep them in your vehicle.

On the the soft vinyl I was able to get both dust and dirt off with no trouble. The wipe showed the dirt that was removed.

On the smooth hard vinyl the results were the same.

Unfortunately on the textured vinyl the wipes did not perform well. After scrubbing for a couple of minutes there was only about a 30% change. This may be due to the wipes inability to get in between the cracks of the texture. However, the rest of the dirt was removed with a sponge and water.

The other thing I noticed is that any chromed surfaces cloud up when wiped with these.

So, these are convenient if you need to be able to quickly dust your dash, but for a good cleaning there are better products."	&&&
Love these wipes!	&&&
Some of the wipes are not separated inside the containers and also they don't pull through the top part almost ever. I always end up taking the whole top part off and I have to separate the wipes before diving into my baby's diaper. However the ingredients used in the wipes has done great for my baby's skin and theirs enough moisture to clean up messes.	&&&
I didn't even get a chance to use this! It will NOT stay closed!The lid randomly pops up all throughout the day. I can't keep wipes in there cause they would dry out....it sits empty on my changing table, just popping up throughout the day.... such a waste of $:(	&&&
Best wipes ever! They are gentle for my babies sensitive skin. Also strong for wiping.	&&&
Love these wipes! They are nice and thick so that you don't have to use a lot. Also they are ultra soft which helps to prevent diaper rash. I am a second time mom and have tried many wipes these are the best ive found.	&&&
Smell great, they do the job!	&&&
These are the thinnest wipes I have ever used, horrible! I will never purchase again!	&&&
Great deal! They lasted awhile and they did the job.	&&&
My daughter has sensative skin and this product is exactly I was looking for !!!!!	&&&
This product is always on my list for the grocery store. With 9 kids it's difficult to find something that all will agree to use! Both girls and boys use these wipes without any issues. These wipes are definitely a staple in my household.	&&&
I received 3 pack sample of wipes from seventh generation and used it for my baby. It doesn't give any rashes or any skin problems. It's thick and gives a natural feeling. What like about it is that, it's fragrance free, made of natural ingredients, it's quality and its hypoallergenic.	&&&
I feel great about using this natural product on my baby. Much better than all the wipes with chemicals. They work well and I like them! The only thing I wish was that they were folded on each other so the next wipe would come up when you pull the one on top of it. They don't do this, which sometimes causes it to be hard to grab just one, but other than that, I love the product!	&&&
My 1st grade daughter was coming home from school with a stomachache almost every day. My first thought was she was just having a hard time adjusting to school. I later found out that she wasn't using the restroom at school because she didn't feel comfortable using toilet tissue alone. I searched for something that would be small and discrete that she could just put in her backpack and take with her to the potty when she needed to "go". There are other brands and wipes out there but none that I could find that were flushable and "kid friendly/approved" until she tried the Kandoo Wipes! Perfect! Perfect size, perfect packaging, flushable and small enough to be discrete and not call out attention to her! The stomachaches stopped and so did the embarrassment of "going" to the bathroom at school!!!	&&&
"I've raved about these wipes to everyone! They were thick, moist, sturdy.
My recent shipment was smaller, thinner wipes and the packaging tears really easily causing the wipes to try out.
Hope they revert to the original wipes."	&&&
WORKS WELL	&&&
Disclosure: I received a sample of this product for free however the opinions contained in this review are mine and mine alone. I appreciate the naturalness of these wipes versus some other brands out there. Seventh Generation makes great products that I am confident using around my kids. I could buy these in bulk I would be a happy mama camper.	&&&
These are my favorite make-up remover wipes. Everyone I have let try them has also switch to them. They are gentle and great at leaving your skin feeling moisturized after using them	&&&
You get a lot of wipes but I do think the antiseptic has been watered down	&&&
So pleased with this purchase! The wipes agree thick enough that you don't use more than you need. No odor or scent for sensitive skin, and overall great quality!	&&&
love these things, I work in the Oil Field so these little wipes work great for a face/hand clean when your in a pinch for water/a restroom....Great Product	&&&
Been using these for almost 2 years. Great wipes.	&&&
These are a little better quality than some of the other flushable wipes on the market and very effective for what they do...I always keep some with me when traveling.	&&&
Absolutely love these wipes - they are just like the ones we were given in the NICU. I just wish they came in Subscribe and Save. They are well worth the extra expense over pre-moistened wipes for sensitive skinned babies.	&&&
This is hands down the best wipes dispenser. Holds almost 2 packages of wipes and is so easy to use with one hand.	&&&
Love the value pack and they are usually on sale. Best sensitive skin wipe out there hands down	&&&
Too thin - I like the thicker ones better.	&&&
This is one of my favorite Lysol products. I use them to wipe out my trash cans throughout the house to keep odors under control.	&&&
Great wipes. Removed everything that needed to be removed, never cause any irritation, no strong oder.	&&&
These wipes are the best they are the only brand I can use on my kids. I like the smell of them too.	&&&
Too moist. Might be good for really sticky messes, but left my LO too wet. There was also a bit of an odor, not terrible but not my fave. I prefer Aleva Naturals Bamboo Baby Wipes	&&&
My husband is a cancer patient, these wipes are wonderful.	&&&
Great price! Being in a wheel chair, I tend to be prone to roid rage and these wipes help cool things down and are much more gentle than paper.	&&&
While these wipes work alright, I just can't get over the smell. Never have I bought wipes with such a strong scent. It's extremely overwhelming in my opinion and smells like awful perfume.	&&&
Been using Baby Bits Solution for about 7 months now. Our baby has a sensitive bum and we've never had any issues with diaper rash. They have a nice smell. They work great with cloth wipes and a wipe warmer.	&&&
This particular box comes with the wipes wrapped in paper. Unfortunately, unless you use the wipes rather quickly, they go dry. Suggest purchasing this item that is wrapped in more of a plastic wrapper.	&&&
There are tons of dashboard protectant liquids on the market. I'm not convinced that any particular product does a better job than others. My dashboard never gets dirtier than a layer of dust and some fingerprints. These wipes do help prevent you from using too much product, though, preventing the greasy residue you get from overuse.	&&&
I like these hand wipes. They are moist and get the job done. Nice to have on hand at parties, too.	&&&
These wipes are larger than most and exceptionally soothing.	&&&
i don't know where i'd be w/o these. the puppy formula is great for both my pup and my adult dog with a delicate stomach. i wipe down their paws and coat with Earthbath wipes every day after they've been out in the dirt and grass.	&&&
Love these wipes, great quality and one of the best facial wipes in market. Its not too harsh on face	&&&
This was given to me as a gift, so glad I didn't spend my own money. A few days after I filled it up and three it in my diaper bag I went to use it and all the wipes were completely dry. This is a totally unnecessary product as you can just buy small on the go bags of wipes, and it doesn't even work. Don't waste money on this.	&&&
I love these wipes! All my kids have extremely sensitive skin, with Huggies Natural Care no allergic reactions!	&&&
These are great. I've used them since day one and my little one hasn't had any issues with them	&&&
Amazing value and great delivery times	&&&
I got three of these for free, with Target sale, gift card, and coupons. I used it to remove all of my make up, and it didn't irritate my eyes like some other brands do. Would definitely recommend this to other people.	&&&
As another reviewer pointed out, these do not truly "disinfect" unless you put in a little more work than just wiping something clean. To me that is actually a positive. I think we have gone a bit crazy with anti-bacterial everything, so I like the fact that I can do a quick clean up without using really harsh chemicals. If you truly want to disinfect, you should be putting in more work anyway and it is not something that you should be doing several times a day. These wipes are great for something like wiping of the toilet or cleaning out your bathroom sink after you get dressed in the morning. It cleans well and has a much better, less chemical smell than most other disinfecting wipes. They are also a good value for the price. I deducted one star just because I found the dispenser to be a challenge at times. But, overall, a very good product.	&&&
Love huggies wipes! It's the whole wipes that I would use for my daughter!! I was always able to fine coupons and their rewards system awesome.	&&&
I have bought/used/loved these wipes for years. The wipes are still great if you can use them before they dry out. The new packaging rips and the plastic thing that closes them to keep them damp falls off. I want the old packaging back.	&&&
Its not a total cleanse but it does take off the make up for me with two clothes because i wear alot but I also use my Clarosonic deep pore to deep clean and its feels amazing my skin feels awsome	&&&
i love these wipes, they are so gentle and soft. i cant believe how great they are!	&&&
Pampers is the only brand I will use on my daughter. Their wipes don't rip. Don't crumble. My favorite.	&&&
Just want to say these are not truly hypoallergenic wipes. I have a very sensitive frenchie and he immediately reacted to them. Since I couldn't use them on him, I started using them just to dust and wipe things. Turns out these are great for getting dirt and muck off of kitchen cabinets and floor boards.	&&&
I love this wipes and my son loves them too. They are moist enough to clean though messes and they are flushable. Great for transitioning potty training babies.	&&&
"We've used a number of different brands and kinds of wipes. So far the only difference I've noticed between any of them is that some brands are too narrow.

I'm happy with these. They're big enough and thick enough to get the job done. The package is easy to use and dispenses well."	&&&
Great wipes! I have tried different store brands looking for the best inexpensive wipe, and I believe I have found them. Love that they bring them to your door and it only takes 2 days. The option of refill or flip top is very convenient! And they smell great! My boys have no issue with the scent or material. And I have sensitive skin twins. The only issue I have is that I would rather have them be a little more moist. But other than that I love these!	&&&
Arrived as expected	&&&
I'm obsessed with these wipes, I have a 10 month old and I feel like my life is constantly cleaning up after her and these wipes are perfect. They clean so much better than I thought. The smell doesn't bother me at all, it's a real scent not something perfume like made to cover up some nasty chemical! I couldn't live without these, thank you Seventh Generation!	&&&
I use a V-Go pump on a daily basis and this product really helps remove the glue that is left on my skin.	&&&
Keeps wipes warm very nice	&&&
We've been using Pampers Sensitive Wipes for our daughter after having tried several other brands that either fell apart constantly, left rashes on sensitive skin, or smelled strange. They work well and we've never had an issue, but when I saw an ad for Amazon's Sensitive wipes at a great first-buy discount I got curious and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were as durable as the Pampers and worked just as well as a sensitive product. The top is easy to open and close and I have less of an issue with the next wipe keeping the lid from closing properly. I will buy these again!	&&&
We, sadly, bought a different brand of hand wipes the last time around. Won't make that mistake again; Germ-X is definitely our brand of choice.	&&&
Hospital-strength disinfectant. Read lable and wear gloves, test on surface first, alcohol is the cleaning agent. Replace water and soaps to clean floors, walls, appliances, door knobs, handles, door/window screens, anything touched by hands. Haven't caught flu, colds, etc, think this product helps. Dispose of wipes in trash (don't flush), disinfectant -alcohol smell is strong but vanishes when dry. Economical compared with regular brand-names. Best product for caregivers for HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis patients, originally created for this purpose, but home-use is great product too.	&&&
These wipes are an absolute staple for my household! My toddler is no longer in diapers, but I still buy these wipes in bulk. I keep a pack in my car at all times for wiping down dirty hands, cleaning up sticky messes, and sanitizing public places. This is a reliable product and I love that it's natural.* I received a sample pack to review from the Generation Good community, but the opinions above are entirely my own. I use this product and I love it!	&&&
Like the name says these wipes are free of unwanted chemicals and smell. Its like just plain sterile water touching babys skin.. feels close to the nature. Each wipe is strong enough to cleanse babys skin gently without wiping off the natural moisture off the skin. I liked this andI received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
My husband and I love using these wipes on our daughter's hands and face! They are so soft and gentle while killing germs. Plus, they smell great, too! They are so handy to have in our diaper bag for on-the-go or just for use at home!	&&&
I am just going to get down to the dirty bit first. As a guy there are design flaws with our bodies that can make it harder to keep all of our nether bits all shiny and smelling fresh. Most of us guys won't ever get the chance ourselves to get a up close and personal meet and greet with case of sweaty balls, or worse head to the track after laying down some "racing stripes". I for one have wanted to have someone else shove their face down there. The least you can do is tidy up a bit, if not for them for the person who dose your laundry. These are the perfect solution for cleaning up on the go. Since try are individually wrapped they don't dry out in youre glove box or gym bag. And they are big enough to freshen up using 1 (or 2 it it is a big mess). We have the luxury of fresh wipes at home, this is the perfect solution for guys on the go.	&&&
Our family is not loyal to any one diaper brand, but Target Up and Up wipes are by far the best for our babies' bums. They get the job done without being too watery, and the sensitive ones really seem to help with preventing diaper rash.	&&&
"These are great performers when it comes to cleaning devices (phones/tablets) not to mention easy to throw a few in your gear bag. As others have noted, this is not for a single box of 200ct wipes, but rather 3 boxes of 60 and a small baggie of 20 wipes. As someone who would like to have access to these in multiple locations, this wasn't an issue for me in the slightest.

Having used several of these over the last few days on multiple devices I would definitely keep these on hand in an effort to keep finger prints and dirt (and germs of course) at bay."	&&&
These wipes smell so wonderful. They are nice and moist. I keep these in my car to use when leaving the gym. I have not noticed any liquid spilling out. The lid seems to be tight. Hopefully they are keeping germs away! Arrived on time.	&&&
Who says you can't wash a cat? Get the spit and other allergens off of your cat and leave their coat very smooth. I like it. And if you do it right, the cat will enjoy it as well.	&&&
With all the concern with ecoli & salmonella & spreadable infections, I use thes to clean up bathrooms, kitchens , light switches, doorknobs etc. As an older person I am more sensitive to these infections that seem tomget passed around. So , these make it quite easy to keep it clean!	&&&
Good price and came in good shape	&&&
We use these “Disinfecting Wipes” in the kitchen, bathroom, door knobs, telephones and even on the desktop computer keyboard. Unfortunately, the directions make clear that these wipes are not going to “disinfect” anything unless the surface is kept wet for 10 minutes – a highly unlikely occurrence. Nevertheless, these wipes make cleaning quick and easy and the lemon and lime blossom scent is very pleasant. So, this product is very good for cleanups; just understand that its disinfecting capability is limited.	&&&
Really helps keep my dogs teeth clean.	&&&
The Pampers sensitive wipes are great for new born babies, it was very soft and thick, which was great for tough jobs!	&&&
Oh I love the packaging on this. No more shrink wrap and nonsense. Just open up the box and there it is! I don't know what I'd do without these wipes. I use them everywhere in my house - with 3 kids at 3 schools, dogs, and cats, I like to know that everything is clean and disinfected!	&&&
Love the natural baby wipes, I don't have a baby anymore but these are multifunctional to clean your kids.	&&&
it is just ok. it is not moistured enough.	&&&
Perfect for our BBQ wedding!!! The guests loved them! And we ended up with extras to pack in our cars and to take camping!	&&&
"I am now doing cloth diapers and cloth wipes full time, but these were my favorites prior to my switch to cloth wipes.
Used Huggies wipes for my first two kids and have some around for occasional use as needed.
They are thick and they don't smell bad like another name brand we tried.
If used with cloth diapers and one is accidentally washed, they do not fall apart in the wash... Which is great!"	&&&
I am a member of Smiley360, and I received free samples of the Preparation H medicated wipes for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. First off, I never had hemorrhoids until after my son was born so I like that these are aimed at women; meaning they are made specifically for our needs. Secondly, the smell is very nice(always a plus to feminine products). These wipes are gentle enough for everyday use, flushable, they cool and soothe, and reduce irritation. These have worked fantastic in everything they claim to do. Not only can they be used for treatment of hemorrhoids, but they can simply be used as a cleansing wipe to freshen up - front or back. I certainly think they're worth a try, whether you're just looking for a delicate cleansing wipe, or for hemorrhoid treatment. And as always, read instructions before use to insure you are using them correctly and effectively.	&&&
I got this wipe container to store my cloth wipes in. It is perfect! Keeps my wipes wet and easy to get to.	&&&
"I am a member of Smiley 360 and “I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”
Preparation H Medicated Wipes for Women are great for taking on the go, they fit in your purse or pocket for when you are traveling. These wipes are soft to the touch and smell great and have the perfect amount of moisture. They have a pleasant scent, they are not irritating and provide relief from burning and itching.
I would recommend this product to all woman suffering from hemorrhoids"	&&&
The Stainless steel streaks with normal cleaners, so I wipe it down after cleaning with this and it looks just like you want - no streaks.	&&&
Very satisfied	&&&
"Works well, smells good, but dries out
spendy for the amount you get in the package
But I do like the MD Mom's products overall"	&&&
Best wipes because there is no scent and they are really soft.	&&&
I expected more from Pampers! These are so thin and I had to use so many more to clean versus other thicker wipes-Huggies. Would not recommend these at all!	&&&
I like the fact that these wipes are soft, and smells refreshing. They take away the pain and itching that is associated with hemorrhoids. It has a smoothing medication that is cool on contact. The best part is they are flushable	&&&
These wipes are as good as the interior sprays Meguiar's offers. The smell is subjective whether you think it's a new car scent. It's smells chemically..a bit plasticy as well. Regardless of the smell, the wipes work well. There's a nice gloss when applied to hard plastics. And less gloss when applied to softer plastics. The smell goes away after 5 days too.	&&&
These are great wipes for pets. We use them on our dog who chronic UTIs to keep her clean and on anther dog who gets crusty stuff under is mouth. He used to hate having his mouth cleaned but I think actually kind of likes it now. They were originally prescribed by my vet for a $1 a wipe, so these are a much better deal at $.24.	&&&
I use these to wipe my dog's paws before coming inside. They are great and good price. I wish they were folded better, they aren't stacked to pull out like tissue paper and sometimes you get one, sometimes a whole bunch come out together. Makes it a bit frustrating, but still a very good product and price.	&&&
I really do tend to get picky about my wipes, and these ones are excellent and also budget-friendly. A good, thick wipe with plenty of moisture without the dreaded drippiness and rather low on the weird ingredient count. Soft, clean up baby bottoms and whatever have you very well. These are the musts of a baby wipe!	&&&
Cleans great, thick and smell great. Not like others that break easily or doesn't clean anything at all. I love buggies wipes I either use these or the sensitive skin	&&&
Great value. Love these wipes!	&&&
These wipes are amazing! Work great! Get a warmer and they work even better!	&&&
This is a go-to product for me when I'm cleaning my bathroom. The product itself works really well and I feel confident that my bathroom is actually clean and disinfected once I've used these wipes. I'm not too fond of the scents they come in, but it's a minor complaint that pales in comparison to the effectiveness of the product.	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes they are so convent for little spills and work great on most surfaces. These are a definite go to for me! Think of them as the baby wipe for your house they can be used for pretty much anything! I always have theses in my home and I use them every day. I keep one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen because they are convenient to grab for a quick cleanup. These are amazing for wiping down any mess. I keep them around the house just in case I need them. These Wipes are a must have if you're a germ freak, I use them to clean everything.	&&&
I did not like these wipes. They shredded like crazy and I needed so many at a time to get my son's bottom clean!	&&&
The way this was described made it appear to be a sunscreen wipe. That's what I wanted. What I got was a thin package of after-sun wipes.	&&&
These are the most amazing wipes, especially for sensitive skin. They aid in the healing process as well as being a fantastic cleaning product for the bum or any other sensitive area.	&&&
These wipes have just the right amount of moisture, not too wet not too dry. They keep my baby's bottom soft and clean.	&&&
We love these wipes. They're higher priced than many but they're thick and sturdy so I use less than many other brands each time we need them.	&&&
"I will give these wipes 5 stars, but really I think they are 4.5 (simply because they are a pain to get out of the package--the next wipe doesn't automatically ""pop up"" like others do). I've tried: Pampers Sensitive, 7th Generation, Huggies, and The Honest Company, and these are by far the best.

I know there were some complaints about mold, but I have yet to see any in the 15+ packages we have used so far. For the most part, the wipes are fairly moist. My favorite part is that they don't have a strong smell, and I don't feel like I'm wiping a chemical factory on my daughters behind. They may be a bit smaller than the big brand wipes, but I am willing to forego a bit of size for a natural wipe.

A tip if your top wipes are a bit dry: Turn the package over for the night to let the liquid disperse down."	&&&
"I love these purell wipes. I used to buy them in store but I can't find them anymore. Good old Amazon comes through again. I use these to wipe down the table at restaurants before putting my baby's food on the table. I tried using those sticky place mats but she just pulls them off. And if I use a plate, she ends up lifting it up, spilling the food. So I use these wipes now to clean the entire area.

I like these because they sanitize the area without using alcohol. It is so much safer for my baby. I know this process works because she has only ever had one cold so far. Of course, I also use these to wipe her hands and those of my older child. I'll get them again when I run out since I can't find in stores. Also, the price here is comparable to in store."	&&&
I rec'd a sample of Seventh Generation Free & Clear Wipes for purposes of my review.I thought they worked better than other brands. They're thick and I found them to be quite durable. I liked the cute duck designs. These wipes didn't fray/tear/leave lint behind like some other brands do. My daughter tends to have very sensitive skin on her butt - other wipes have caused skin irritations/rash. We had no trouble w/ these wipes. These wipes are also good for wiping up sticky faces/hands too. I would purchase this again as it works well and I found them to work better than other brands I've tried. We're very happy these wipes don't contain harmful chemicals/parabens. Great choice for those w/ sensitive skin or wanting to use wipes that are Free & Clear.	&&&
These wipes worked wonderfully for my daughter's sensitive skin. The wipes didn't rip and cleaned up the mess really well. I like that they are a more environmental option and area better choice than traditional options. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
"Great deal on these wipes, which are handy for backpacking and camping.
Smell good."	&&&
excwllent product delivered in very shirt fime.	&&&
"easy to use
convenient
just OK doesn't get waterproof mascara off
don't feel really clean after using the wipes
would need to wash after using the wipes"	&&&
Hands down I would not use any other wipes then this one. It took me a long time to find wipes that suit my son. This one does everything that I want. It cleans up after my son without using too much wipes and it is natural. No other wipes are better in my option. Love love love!	&&&
I love these wipes. Very pleased. They have aloe, chamomile and cucumber infused in them. They cool on contact. My mom loves them too. Glad I got to try them . I received them for free from Smiley360, my opinions presented are my own.	&&&
This is a HORRIBLE Wipe pouch I've bought TWO and they BOTH tore up with in a week up having them.. Not to mention Huggies wipes SUCK and rip so easily.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are super soft for a newborn. Some of the other wipes seem to be a little rougher but better for older babies. They are the perfect thickness with a good smell. They are not oily like other brands. Huggies did good with these.	&&&
"I have health issues that make respiratory illnesses life threatening. A few years ago, I started using Lysol Disinfecting wipes along with some other infection controls protocol.

These have worked so well for me. If I leave a tub on the counter it is easy to give the bathroom a quick swipe. I carry them in the truck and keep a tub in the barn. Having them handy has been a great thing.

I love the scent. It is a nice lightly sweet lemon. It smells fresh."	&&&
These wipes are good. Do not use if you just shaved! BUT its all around ok. It would work about as great as you would expect it to.	&&&
Wow - aren't these just a miracle in a plastic bottle! I LOVE Clorox disinfecting wipes! Instead of going to the cabinet and getting out my disinfecting spray, then walking across the kitchen to pull a few paper towels, I reach under my sink and grab a bottle of these!!! Not huge wet mess to clean up and no more countless trips all over the house!!	&&&
Easy to use with a toddler but bag is not resealable so I've lost some to drying out.	&&&
I like these because they are nearly unscented. They are not antibacterial, which is also fine with me. I can wash my hands if required.	&&&
I'm all about the bang for your buck and these are definitely that! Good quality at a great price	&&&
I used Huggies wipes for my babies when they were babies, and carried them in my purse until my babies were adults (to clean faces, hands, other messes). Now that they are adults, I have a box in the house to clean up household messes. Huggies wipes don't disintegrate like cheaper wipes do. The one complaint I have: Leave out the aloe. Some people (like me) are allergic, and it adds no value. It's just the trend right now.	&&&
My baby has slightly sensitive skin and some eczema patches and these wipes are perfect for us. These wipes are so soft,and do not cause any irritation. They are much softer than other wipes I've used (Huggies, Tugaboos). I feel like I use less wipes for messy diapers with these because they are so soft and have a lot of moisture. Also they do not have a hefty scent - like some other wipes do. They smell clean, which is another thing I really love about these wipes. These are the only wipes my family uses now.	&&&
Great wipes! They clean the world!	&&&
So much easier to use these wipes	&&&
These wipes are perfect for my sensitive baby! They are thick, eco-friendly, and they get the job done! Best of all, they do not have an overpowering scent of added fragrance!	&&&
They did not come out of package easily, and would tear sometimes. Fragrance was nice and I liked that they are septic system friendly.	&&&
I love these wipes! Especially since they're unscented. They work great for removing makeup too	&&&
This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review. And the verdict is in, I'm in love! I wear waterproof mascara and these Aveeno wipes removed it with no problems at all! Definitely telling my friends about these wipes, I'm sure they'll love them as much as I do!	&&&
My kids have been out of diapers for years but I still carry wipes with me.	&&&
These wipes are free of parabens, fragrance, and dyes. They smell great and are soft to my kids skin. They are not rough and they do not chafe their skin. We use these for everything. They are great!	&&&
I started buying these a year ago because my kids have allergies and there noses run constantly and tissues were making there noses raw and bleed so we tried boogie wipes and they are amazing there are the only thing we use now. My kids even have to take one to bed with them. My husband and I have also used them they are awesome and smell so good and are soft and durable. My family loves the grape scent boogie wipes?????? My kids always ask and make sur e we have boogie wipes in the house and car. We love them.	&&&
This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review. I love these ultra calming wipes and now use it for almost everything from removing makeup to just cleaning my face with it at the gym, or outdoors in summer or before going to bed at night. The wipes are of good size and soft so helps in cleaning the face well and without any irritation, redness, oily or dry feel. It makes my face feel clean, refreshed, silky. I also love that the wipes are mildly scented.	&&&
We really wanted to like these wipes because they are Pampers brand but they were too thin, and we had to use too many for cleaning poopy messes on the go. The wipes smelled great but the babies still needed soap and water after using the wipes. This review is based solely on our experience with the product. No incentive from the manufacturer.	&&&
I bought these a week ago, and I am so glad I did. My kid got sick and had a runny nose. I was able to pull out these wipes and wipe their nose. Now whenever we go to the store, my kid always reminds me to buy the wipes.	&&&
I used Aveeno Ultra-Calming Makeup Removing Wipes anytime I felt the need to wash or refresh my face. It definitely does what it's name promised- my skin definitely felt calmed and soothed immediately upon use. My skin felt hydrated and so soft, and definitely clean. The wipes were not irritating or drying, and instead my skin felt very nourished. I did not wear make-up during my use time so I don't know how effective the wipes are at removing makeup, but they did remove any oil from my face. I had no irritation or break outs, and I would definitely use this product again. This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

Very happy with these wipes. Better than most I've tried	&&&
When my kids get sick, it's all about the snot. My kids get raw noses, and then I found Boogie Wipes. These little tissues of love are AMAZING! No more rawness, and they smell great! I will never use a tissue again. We are a BW family!	&&&
Great wipes for the price and does it work well - to clean !!	&&&
I didn't like these as much as the sensitive wipes even though these were hypoallergenic. They are a great wipe, but I found that another pampers wipes worked for me just a little better.	&&&
I use about 4 to 7 a.day so a great deal	&&&
Given as a gift; heard no complaints.	&&&
Great product, dries quickly and cleans gently.	&&&
Don't buy these. The box is WAY bigger than it needs to be. When you open the box it's half empty. And the quality of the wipes are not that good, they leave streaks on tablets.	&&&
We always use baby wipes in my household with baby or without baby.....I don't personally like the fragrance wipes and always lean towards the nonfragrance	&&&
These are the best wipes I have ever used. I have had 3 children now and nothing compares to these wipes. There are others that are just as good but these are way cheaper.	&&&
i prefer to use Pampers brand, i don't like these too much i feel like i can't clean my sons bottom & i have to use twice the wipes with these unlike pampers I can use a few to get all the nasty stuff from his bottom.	&&&
I love my warmer for cloth wipes. I just pour about 2 cups of wipe solution in then place this pad before adding my dry wipes.	&&&
Say goodbye to those sore, red, puffy noses when it's cold and allergy season. My little boy has no problem with letting me tend to his runny noses when I use Boogie Wipes.	&&&
So much easier to pop these out when I want to clean my computer screen or TV screen. Very convenient and efficient.	&&&
Bought so crap wipes at the Dollar store, should have known better. These are great, nice and thick, don't fall apart when used. Easy to put a few packets in each glove-box and around home. Well made.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are cheap, good for baby but have a little unpleasant smell. I didn't want any fragrances, which I am sure the company doesn't add but I prefer that they had no smell at all. Otherwise they are strong and sturdy and a good value. I'm sticking with them.	&&&
I generally remove my makeup at night with either micellar water or makeup wipes (I use the Sephora brand wipes). This does a good job of removing the makeup on my face but doesn't completely remove my eye makeup. I decided to add these to my routine to address that problem. While these wipes do a good job of removing eyeshadow and eyeliner, they do not fully remove mascara. I do not even wear waterproof mascara, so I find it very disappointing that these wipes do not work. I honestly think they do a worse job at removing eye makeup than regular face wipes. I would not recommend spending additional money on these.	&&&
I have been using Huggies natural wipes for 5 years now. I have 3 kids and these are the only wipes I use on them. They are fragrance free and never leave a icky residue in the skin. Also they are nice and sturdy to clean up any mess.	&&&
Very satisfied with the product, i recommend to all ny friends	&&&
$10 for 3?!! Damn. Best deal ever. I love disinfectant wipes and spray so I couldn't pass up this deal. They arrived new and wipes feel moist because the weight feels heavy when I flip the container upside down. Haven't used them yet bc I've got one I had already and want to keep these 3 sealed.	&&&
Seventh Generation baby wipes work great for my two son's sensitive skin. They clean up big messes and are strong & thick. The only issue I had is they turn linty when wiping.	&&&
I'm not one to use different types of wipes, but these are definitely great! Love the scents and they are so gentle!	&&&
love these. have a pack in all my bags, car, bathrooms, etc. super easy to keep fresh with a reseal tab and small enough to keep everytwhere. plus you can flush them. no brainer	&&&
Mine did not come as one box with 400 wipes. It came as 6 boxes (60 each) & 2 travel pouches (20 each). I prefer it this way. Just something to keep in mind though.	&&&
I am a sucker for these things. They are so soft and silky and they smell great. My kids still don't like when I wipe their nose, but I feel little less mean about doing it.	&&&
My daughters have very sensitive skin and have lately been very prone to diaper rashes, which is so upsetting! Luckily these wipes exist though, because they don't disrupt their skin. It's very gentle and soft and I don't feel guilty when I have to wipe some bottoms! And what mother wants to feel guilty when cleaning their child? Lol. I love these wipes!	&&&
I've tried almost all brand of wipes and preferred huggies until these were given to me as a gift they are now my all time favorite they are so soft and don't rip easily they truly get the job done	&&&
"You have two choices with the packaging on this package of three: Go with the ""Frustration Free""! No doubt about it: The box holds the three containers nice and tight and the pop top won't pop open in shipping. Plus, you won't have to struggle with getting the plastic wrapper off, 'cause it doesn't come wrapped in plastic any more. Definitely: ""Frustration Free"" is the way to go in this case.

I like this fragrance: Citrus with an emphasis on lime, plus a touch of floral or sweetness. I like the thickness of the wipes: They pick up a lot of dirt, but are still thin enough for me to use my fingernail to get into corners.. I also like the amount of solution: Damp, but not sopping wet. They are great wipes for glass cooktops (unless you've really got a mess.)

When I have a choice of disinfectant products, I always stick with Lysol, they have been around for ages. I trust their products. When cold and flu season kicks into high gear, we keep several containers handy: Kitchen, bathrooms, near the phones and high-traffic door knobs. The wipes dry quicker and keep the germ-killing solution where you want it.

This summer we need these wipes sooner than later for a special situation. We have well-loved, totally healthy, indoor cats--and we try very hard to keep it that way. BUT, we couldn't ignore an abandoned kitty that has taken up residence in one of our trees. She sleeps in a crook all day, comes down in the evening to hunt frogs in the yard. We put out a small bowl of cat food for her, but have not been able to get her to a vet for tests. How to minimize the possibility of spreading germs to our indoor cats? Lysol wipes give us some peace of mind."	&&&
I love these wipes! They are soft and definitely make it easier to clean my baby with.	&&&
I usually stay away from the scented wipes as my kids react to them somewhat but I figured, what the heck. I read other reviews on the scent and how it's like a light cucumber and that's spot on. It smells so good! I threw out my last pack of target brand unscented wipes because I was so sick of the smell of them. Now my little one's butt smells fresh after a diaper change and the poop smell doesn't linger. No bad reactions to these either! Will continue to buy :) Thanks Amazon for making a great smelling wipe!	&&&
One of the best wipes that I have used for my children. They are thick enough and I only have to use one or two wipes compared to multiples of other brands.	&&&
I love these wipes just because you can use it anywhere! My fav scent would have to be vanilla. It also doesn't dry out your skin like other products do. I received this product for free to test out!	&&&
Love these. Great price and non toxic for the kids. My very sensitive kids do well with these. Much better than huggies or pampers wipes. I do like honest co wipes too, but seventh gen is a better price.	&&&
I loved that seventh generation wipes is thicker and the size is larger than other brand and it not contains harsh chemicals so I am not worry if I want to used it on my Childs that have sensitive skins like me. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I was really impressed with how much makeup these wipes took off. It didn't remove all of my mascara, but overall these worked really well. This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.	&&&
Seriously love all Boogie Wipes! I worked at buybuy BABY when I was introduced to them during a company-wide competition. I learned all about them so I could properly pitch them to our customers. I quickly learned just how amazing they are. I started using them myself during the harsh Jersey winter which reeked havoc on my nose from constant blowing and wiping. Within a week of consistently using them, my raw nose was no longer raw and I began to keep the small packs in my purse, back pocket, and even in the car. To this day the convenience of the small packs takes the place of tissues wherever possible. Who says you need to be a kid to use Boogie Wipes?	&&&
My son is almost five and still uses these regularly! I buy them for every baby shower as well. They are a must have for every parent. Easy on little noses plus non irritating for sensitive skin and noses. My son doesn't care for scented boogie wipes, but we LOVED the menthol ones and wish those would come back! We always have to but the nonscented in bulk because my son loves them so much. He uses them to get rid of normal boogies and ofcourse when he gets sick too. I have had some many friends thank me for showing them boogie wipes. They really are my favorite baby product ever!	&&&
Excellent wipes for babies, children and women.	&&&
Seriously. Zero K wipes leave me feeling fresh and cool from my subway commute through my evening kickboxing class. These packs are easy to stash in my bag when I'm out and about, or to keep in the car when I'm running around. Love having these handy for any situation. These are a must during the summer months... and a must during the non-summer months.	&&&
Huggins baby wipes are the only ones I use. These specific ones were my favorite! The scent was great and one goes a long way!	&&&
I love how soft these wipes are. They're sensitive to my baby's skin.	&&&
These wipes are great very gentle on babies skin and the price can't be beat.	&&&
"I would give this a 5 star rating but for one problem. Clorox does not seal the canister but just uses the dispensing lid (Lysol wipes seals the cansister). The problem is the dispensing lid has hole for dispensing and the cover for this is not very tight, and when you buy in bulk (4 at a time) by the time you get to the 3rd and 4th canister the wipes have dried out due the cansister not being sealed.

I now use plastic wrap to seal the canister then put the lid back on, this has solved the problem. Clorox, wake up and seal the canisters."	&&&
Great product, great price. Shipping was a little slow, but the price was right.	&&&
I expected a personal hygiene item with Lysol wipe like alcohol base hand wipes, it turned out that I got a bad deal. I wanted a wipe to disinfect my hands in places where I don't have immediate reach of water, as well to clean my office desk where I feel the cleaner people have not done a good job; well it still works great for hard surface cleaning and scent really good. But I wish Lysol wipes could serve for hands cleaning.	&&&
Bought them when we went camping, worked very well to remove the dirt and grime from Baby Aaliyah who loves dirt, who knew lol!	&&&
I love these wipes, I use to think that they were a of money . I now wipe up everything with these wipes, now everything smells cleaner and is clean what a relief, I also like the smell that they leave behind!	&&&
I love these. They feel so cool and they are just the right size too. They smell nice also. They are so easy to carry on the go and they are priced just right too! I received a free sample of these from Smiley360.	&&&
These wipes are great. I use them to help my son with potty training. Its especially great that I don't have to worry about him clogging my toilet with normal baby wipes.	&&&
I love these wipes. I got for my granddaughter and so soft and works good on her sensitive skin.	&&&
Great for a small dog!	&&&
Very gentle on the baby's skin.	&&&
Love! I have been using these diapers for almost 3 years! They are my favorite. I love the the smell for one but the quality of the wipes is great. They are thick and you can get away with using less! Now that I'm pregnant with baby number 2 I have registered for every size of this diaper.	&&&
I bought these and I also bought the BumGenius cloth baby wipes. These are smaller than the bumgenius wipes, and they don't seem to be as thick. However, for the price-they are an excellent quality fabric and work well both wet and dry on my infant son and they are soft-easy to clean-and don't wrinkle very easily even after multiple washes/uses (which makes it easier to put away/store)	&&&
We love all things Huggies when it comes to diapering our babe. These wipes especially are a favorite around here! They are nice and thick, we never have issues with them tearing and they come at such a great price.	&&&
I was underwhelmed by these wipes. I love the price, packaging, Eco-friendly concept, sensitive smell, and value for my money. Not the worst I've used but doesn't compare to Pampers Sensitive. Probably won't buy again.	&&&
as good as it gets	&&&
I love it 20$ when you get 808 wipes 13 refills . at the store its 24 and up for a 7 refill pack of wipes.	&&&
Great value pack. We keep them in our cars. LOVE to have these on hand. They work very well.	&&&
I take these every where! They are so convenient when you are out and need to wash your hands but can't get to a bathroom. I'm not crazy about the scent but they are antibacterial and kill flu and stomach viruses so you or your kids won't catch it	&&&
We love these wipes and will use them every time! We have tried other brands, and even other pampers wipes. These are by far the softest and gentlest to use on our babies.	&&&
Pampers Wipes are awesome! They work really well and smell amazing. They are thick without being too thick.	&&&
We love how natural these wipes are and how they stay nice and hydrated all the way to the end of the pack. They are the only wipes we use.	&&&
I use these on my kitchen table and they are great! Handy and do the job. My table and chairs look new after I use these wipes.	&&&
Love the disinfecting wipes (all scents) Great at cutting grease in kitchen. Would love to have floor cleaning pads with the same formula.	&&&
Love these wipes! Especially love the Smellin' Mellon scent! Smells so good!	&&&
Really do keep the wipes damp-others we have tried allow the wipes to dry out, rendering them useless...	&&&
I thought this product had the "pre-biotic" in them.	&&&
Good for wiping baby butts.	&&&
The AVEENO ULTRA-calming makeup removing wipes are so soft. They work so well removing my makeup, normally I have to use a cleaning soap. These make you skin feel so smooth. These are disposable wipes so they can just be thrown away after your use. I was very impressed with how well these worked.This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.	&&&
I was very happy with the sample package that I recieved from Seventh Generation. I liked the overall design and look to it. But more importantly I liked that the wipes were thick and a thick sturdy wipe is what is needed when your little one has sticky yucky bums! Thickness is very important to me. Also there was no scent so it didn't mix and leave a funk like many scented wipes do. Plus the wipes are free of the nasty chemicals you find in most if not all other wipes on the store shelves. These wipes were gentle and not once in the time I used the pack did they have any rashes.	&&&
Haven't used either product too much, but they have been working so far. I used the wipes for my touch screen and cleansing duster for the keys. I do worry a little about the cleaner that comes out of the cleansing duster though. A little worried about getting liquid in my computer!	&&&
These wipes feel cleaner than the other ones I've tried (Pampers, some from the hospital, Target brand, and Honest). I alternate between using these and cloth wipes with just water, and baby's skin is happy. Since I switched to these, he hasn't had a diaper rash, and my (sensitive skin) has not felt dry. When one of these packs gets to about halfway, I throw it into the diaper bag, so I can use them on the go.	&&&
I'm a HUGE fan of Honest Beauty and was excited to try these wipes as a free sample. I'm really glad I didn't buy them because they were worthless. I attempted to remove my eye makeup and it really just smudged it all around my eyes, and even made it more difficult to remove via my usual methods. I am really big on not wasting things, but I just threw these in the trash. Definitely would NOT recommend these.	&&&
The packaging is GREAT! Keeps the wipes wet. Easy to carry. Good for travel. You can always keep the box and refill it. Good brand. Always purchase target brand over anything	&&&
I love these wipes! I've used them with both of my children. They aren't too thick or too thin and never had a problem with diaper rash while using them.	&&&
Best disinfecting wipes I've ever used. They come in different scents and the wipes don't tear easily.	&&&
These do not irritate my baby's bum like other wipes do!	&&&
I always keep Lysol wipes around. Never know when someone is going to be sick and it is an easy thing to grab and wipe all handles and knobs daily.	&&&
best wipes I love them they are so affordable and they are great on sensitive skin as well I don't think ill be trying any different ones anytime soon	&&&
As usual, all the natural goodness you can get for your furry bestie. And I got them at a great deal. I wipe my yorkipoos paws after walks and messy business. She smells great after too!	&&&
Love these wipes! Fortunately, my baby doesn't have sensitive skin so any wipe we use on her is fine, with the exception of Up & Up from Target. We usually stick with Huggies wipes though because we've found them to be really good at getting the job done. We usually get the Simply Clean, the Natural Care, or the One and Done, depending on which is cheaper at the moment. Thought about switching to Pampers wipes since we use Pampers diapers but we figured why switch if we're happy with the Huggies brand wipes? Would definitely recommend.	&&&
Didn't last nearly as long as it should have. One and dones work much better.	&&&
Glad I tried them! Very soft to the skin.	&&&
I absolutely love all the Boogie Wipes products and recommend them to every parent. They don't scrape little noses and they smell wonderful! Any snot or boogers are whisked away instantly versus tissues or baby wipes which take a few tries to get rid of any yuckiness. I say make sure you always have these in your purse or diaper bag!	&&&
These pet wipes are good for small quick clean ups.	&&&
Can't say enough great things about these wipes. Recommend to anyone without a doubt in my mind!	&&&
These wipes are fantastic, not much else to say about them.	&&&
Love these wipes! My two month old baby has not had any diaper rash. We also use Burt's Bees Baby Nourishing Oil at each diaper change. The thickness and texture of these wipes are perfect. I even tear one in half to use for non-poo clean ups. The wipes have hardly any aroma; they smell fresh and natural. Like all wipes though, the last several are a bit more wet, but no biggie. I store unopened packs top down so as to distribute the liquid more; helps a bit. Highly recommend these!	&&&
"I didn't give them five stars because they are a little expensive"	&&&
My Baby loves the freshsness of this wipes!! Look how much he enjoys it!!	&&&
I keep the tub in a large ziploc bag to keep the towelettes from drying out. These do not have a strong odor (that's good) and do not make my sensitive dogs' skin react (that's good too).	&&&
Really liked these wipes. Easy and convenient to use.	&&&
"Best thing ever so much better for the kids and they love them. I have been tell everyone about them, will keep buying them."	&&&
"This is very convenient and germs disinfected."	&&&
I love these wipes we were away and purchased another brand and they were awful! I will never pick another wipe. They don't break when wiping. Even if use them on there face and hands they hold up well to the biggest of messes.	&&&
These are the only wipes we use for our sensitive infant. They have the right amount of wetness and grip and aid in cleaning up messes very well.	&&&
I loved these to clean glasses iPhone tv remote comcast remote and caretakers to used it on their phone I even wipe off my wallet!	&&&
Love these wipes	&&&
This item does a great job but it was hard to get the wipes out of the container	&&&
Gentle on baby and a nice scent. These wipes are nice and strong and do the job	&&&
Texture-wise these are great wipes. I was very pleasantly surprised. It does the job, they soft, sturdy and each wipe is pretty big!	&&&
These work well. The medication doesn't seem to help much with the itch but used with the anti itch cream these wipes work well.	&&&
These are ok. I think the improved gentle formula is better than it was before as the old formula seemed to leave an almost soapy residue. The wipes are thick, which is nice. Also you can always get good deals by using coupons. I like that it doesn't have any fragrance either.	&&&
Feel sticky after touching it. Hard to find the opening on the tape. Very easy to pull out a pile rather than one piece.	&&&
"I love using the most natural products on my Grandson when I am watching him. These wipes have no harsh chemicals in them. I feel safe using them not only on his little bootie, but also on his face and hands after meal times. I also use them to wipe his nose, they are soft and are much more comfortable on his nose than Kleenex. These wipes could be just a little thicker but that would be my only wish. This is a great 6 pack of wipes. So handy to put one in the diaper bag, the kitchen, the changing table and have some for later too. I use them to clean my hands and they don't dry my skin at all.
These are for sensitive skin and in my opinion all babies have sensitive skin and we must take care to not irritate. My Grandson has had no skin issues while using these wipes. If you're looking for an all natural baby wipe, try these today!
I received these Dr K Premium Baby Wipes at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
Love this wipes. I tendon't to grab wipes wrong and unlike other brands pampers wipes doesn't rip easily!	&&&
Pampers have all great products and wipes are must have. These are great wipes for sensitive skin babies. My son never had any rash. I would hight recommend these.	&&&
I received boogie wipes in a care package and my kids absolutely loved them. No more crying or fussing to get their noses wipes. Love them.	&&&
These wipes are great for everyday quick clean clean ups from wiping hands to cleaning messes off the table	&&&
Great wipes	&&&
I love these wipes! They don't give my girls rashes, and plus they are great for removing makeup!	&&&
"This two pack Cloth Makeup remover is a new and different concept in the past year. Other companies sell this for way too much money of which I have purchased. This is the exact same material at less than half the cost with a bonus makeup brush cleaner. This is an awesome and delicate way to remover makeup. It is environment friendly because you can now stop using disposable facial wipes. This brand comes with two cloths, One in Pink and one in Purple. This is still a great purchase.

I have found it to be effective, suitable and usable.

"tl;dr: Sometimes manufactured baby wipes are a necessary evil. These do what baby wipes are supposed to do and the minimal ingredients list makes me feel a little less guilty.

Me: A Do-it-Yourself kind of lady with an affinity for aromatherapy and eco-friendly living.

..So why the heck am I writing a review about manufactured baby wipes?

TSA questioning borders on interrogation for the things I bring on the plane for baby.
Homemade baby wipes? Cloth diapers? Food pouches?
They look at me like I have a third eye in the middle of my forehead.

To cut down on some of the stress of travelling, I wanted to purchase some regular ol' packaged baby wipes.
Here's the issue: both baby and I have very sensitive skin.
It's inspired a minimal chemical life style, but it's more a pain in the epidermis than anything. (High-brow humor, folks.)
Ergo, I needed to find something with as few unnatural ingredients as possible, a soft weave, and with as little scent as can be had.

How do these rate?
Look, they're not my home brewed organic everything wipes, but they really aren't terrible.

There's a slight scent to them, but considering that other ""non-perfumed"" wipes I've encountered are like walking into the fragrance section of Macy's, I'm going to call these fairly unscented.

The wipe is thick and absorbs quite a bit.
The weave of the fabric is ridged- something about which I was worried when it came to skin irritation- but it turned out to be a blessing.
It gets into the nooks and crannies of my kid and takes with it quite a bit more than a uniform weaved wipe.
This allows me to use fewer wipes and makes me a very happy environmentalist.
The weave is non-irritating and less porous than other brands I've used. This may account for the better absorbency / clean up.

Baby has become slightly red from time-to-time using these, but there was no definitive allergic reaction.
I've also used these on myself. I prefer a simple bidet, but airport bathrooms aren't a place to be a snob.
I didn't have any reaction and felt quite clean afterwards.
So on the sensitive skin front, we're giving a thumbs-up.

What DON'T I like about these?
The packs are kind of heavy.
Maybe it's the thickness of each wipe or the density of the weave causing it.
Either way, each pack feels heavier than other packs with identical sheet counts I've tried.

Speaking of thickness/heavy someone asked if these are flushable.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
(This answer is written in spirit of all the ""NO""s on the packaging.)
But seriously, your pipes are just BEGGING to be clogged if you flush a few of these.

All-in-all, I'm pleased with these, but still prefer making my own due to a very reasonable ingredients list.
It's still nice to get a little help from my friends. ;)
If DIY is not your jam, these are definitely decent wipes for those needing a solution for sensitive skin.

Like you, I rely on quality Amazon reviews to make my purchase decisions.

I just recieved these wipes yesterday after waiting a long time to finally be able to try them, and I must say I'm very happy with them. They're a great size and my toddler cannot rip them into tiny shreds easily when she trys to grab one during changings like cheap brands, but I do wish they were slightly wetter (I'm probably just used to the very wet huggies wipes). I gave them four stars for that reason, but they do get the job done and these will be our new every day wipes from now on. I also love the fresh scent! It doesnt smell too perfumey or bad at all.	&&&
I love using Aveeno Ultra-Calming Makeup Removing Wipes. I normally wash my face twice a day at a minimum and using the Aveeno makeup removing wipes makes the process so much easier. They are very gentle on your skin, have no scent, and literally take the makeup right off of your face with just one wipe. You can basically use one wipe for all of your makeup removal without the fope drying out really fast compared to competitor brands. The wipes leave my face feeling smooth and soft and moisturized, opposed to feeling dried out like other wipes have made my face feel. This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.	&&&
I love these wipes! Whenever my one year old has a cold these are my go to wipes. They're very soft and don't irritate her face. I also frequently use them for clean up after she eats messy foods.	&&&
"I am a tough judge of disposable wipes and actually prefer cloth wipes and home made solution. The Dr K Premium Baby Wipes are as close to cloth as I've found in a disposable wipe. They're thick, durable, and I love that there aren't a bunch of chemical additives. You won't have to worry about using a bunch of wipes for a single diaper change. Just one wipe will do it and there's no chance you'll poke through and end up with a poo finger. I accidentally washed one of these with our cloth diapers and didn't notice til it came out of the dryer. The wipe stood up to washing and drying quite well and it was very cloth like. I'm very impressed with the quality of the Dr K Premium Wipes...but I wouldn't want to accidentally flush one down the toilet because they really are super thick.
I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review - the thoughts and opinions expressed are my own."	&&&
Love the thickness of these wipes! They make me feel like our baby's bottom is really clean afterwards! We have gone back for more!	&&&
Best wipes for sensitive skin on babies. Also has less chemicals. Even if you're not a chemical phobe, why expose your pristine perfect baby to unnecessary chemicals? Incidentally, my son is eczema prone and these were the best for him. They are thick and don't tear easily either. I found I used less of these wipes than some other brands also.	&&&
I really like it. it takes off make up well and does not leave your face oil nor does it sting	&&&
These are miracle workers in sheet form. I use these everywhere in my apartment. They clean everything in the kitchen from spilled food on the counter to geese on the stove. They work on almost every surface and the fresh scent hangs around after you're done cleaning. I was e excited to see that these were available for subscribe and save.	&&&
I recommend Water Wipes if you want to use wipes because they only have two ingredients.. I do not like Huggies as much because they have so many ingredients and can cause butt rash but they are quite soft and smells really good!	&&&
I haven't started using it, but it feels so soft. One thing that I wanna mention is the size. Although it says "extra large", but the wipes are actually small.	&&&
my son has very sensitive skin and we have had the best luck with these wipes. A name brand that you can trust, gets the job done and saving those pampers points is totally worth it too!	&&&
I use two for cleaning up heavy mess and one mostly , it's a good quality wipes.	&&&
It's 9AM, you're at work and nature calls. Do you want to rely in the crappy 2-ply to keep you clean all day, or would you rather reach for a thick, wet wipe? I know what I choose to get me by, and it's Dude Wipes. Also great for the outdoorsman, several fit into a pants or pack pocket to keep you clean and comfy while afield...unless you just prefer leaves.	&&&
Love these wipes and feel good that they don't have chemicals!	&&&
My son loves these flushable wipes as they are convenient to assist him in learning how to properly clean himself after using the toilet. Perfect for toddlers in potty training. I would recommend to everyone who has a child and/or is in need of wipes free of harsh materials and overwhelming scents.	&&&
"My daughter was developing chemical burn on her bum from standard wipes (tried four or five all natural, pure and free brands) and we had to use cut up fabric and water to clean her - it was the only way!

Thankfully a friend recommended these to me! Saved my sanity going out of the house!!!!

AND really is pure and free!"	&&&
I've used multiple face wipes to remove makeup and these are the best I've used so far! They are incredibly gentle, have no harsh chemicals, and NO fragrance--which means no burning or stinging! I only use these to remove the majority of my makeup and then follow up with coconut oil to remove the rest of my makeup. ?	&&&
After using Pampers baby fresh wipes, I can attest that they are the best all around compared to other brands. They are strong, soft, gentle, and clean the best. The texture is great and they don't tear when pulling them out of the container. We love the Pampers Baby Fresh Wipes over any other.	&&&
We love these wipes! They do an excellent job of thoroughly cleaning and do not leave residue behind. I've tried other brands and keep returning to Pampers because the others just don't work as well.	&&&
Nice try Amazon. Kudos for not using Methyl Isothiazolinone. However, this product is not for me. I am allergic to many ingredients that cause terrible contact dermatitis. The disodium cocoamphodiacetate in this product is documented to cause such skin reactions in people like myself.	&&&
Good source of glass cleaner for eyeglasses without having to "fog" the glasses to clean the surface. Not bad for 6 cents/unit.	&&&
Wonderful to place in multiple rooms.	&&&
My 13-year old daughter LOVES these wipes. They are so simple and easy to use, and for a young teen to remember to do on a daily basis (morning and night). They keep her face free of pimples. I bought the Wal-mart brand, of the grapefruit wipes, and they did not work for her. So, I have to keep buying Neutrogena. If she goes 1 day without using these wipes, I can tell a difference. These wipes are oil-free and the grapefruit really dries out any pimples trying to form. I wouldn't use on a dry face, but more of an oily face. They keep her face SO CLEAR. The smell doesn't bother me or my daughter, but my husband says it stinks.	&&&
I switched to cloth wipes and these are super soft. I like that they are thin and get my baby clean.	&&&
I really like these facial wipes! They work well, don't dry out, and come in a nice size pack.	&&&
I used these with both of my kids. They are very soft and don't irritate your baby's skin. Love these wipes.	&&&
The product is fine but I saw same product at Sam's Club for about half the price.	&&&
My dog has seasonal allergies and so far he hasn't had a breakout. I use 2 wipes everyday after walks. My biggest issue is that the wipes are small. I can barely get enough out of one wipe for a half side of my 25 lbs dog.	&&&
With my grandson's allergies and wiping his nose on a frequent bases, I find this product to be awesome. With saline and not an alcohol base the wipes do not burn the irratated skin. It also has vit E to help with the healing. Getting him to let me wipe his nose is no longer a problem.	&&&
I have used these particular wipes for years, starting with my first born. My children have sensitive skin and these wipes have always been gentle.	&&&
Huggies wipes seem to work the best of all the wipes i have purchased. I keep them handy in my vehicles and purse for all of the messes my boys seem to make.	&&&
I really wanted to like these, but they are a bit thick for wipes and because they are two pieces of material sewn together after a few washes they kind of separate a bit when trying to use them. I'm not sure how to describe what happens just that it annoys me. I prefer the Go Via brand wipes.	&&&
A must have in our house! I use these disinfecting wipes for every room. They definitely make me feel like I've accomplished a great deal of cleaner and make me feel safer about germs. My boyfriend loves to use them for cleaning the shower for a better clean. Smells great too!	&&&
I like it and am using it all the day for all purpose	&&&
They do the job. When you have a reward certificate and the total cost is tax only, how can you argue?	&&&
Easy to use. I wish I had found these sooner. I keep plenty on hand.	&&&
These wipes are great at removing makeup, even mascara and eyeliner. However, if you have sensitive skin such as myself, I do suggest using a face wash after using them, otherwise your face will feel really dry.	&&&
My baby spits out her binky all the time. These wipes help me make sure it stays clean when we are out and about.	&&&
These are great all around wipes for both humans and pets.	&&&
These would be great if my 11 month old would let me use them on him!	&&&
I have been purchasing these wipes through Amazon since my daughter was born (just over a year ago). I love them. Great price, very gentle. Only today when I went to reorder yet another box, I am told this product is for "Prime" members only. Oh excuse me, I guess my money is no longer good enough. That's okay, Walmart sells this pack too and I'm sure they will be happy to take my money.	&&&
"Having a newborn, he never can keep his pacifier in his mouth! These pacifier wipes are convenient to wipe and go with peace of mind that it is clean enough for him to use again. A must have carry item when no water or bathroom is around to clean kf again! The package is easy to open when your hands are tied up carrying a baby! One of the best inventions ever."	&&&
I love these. They can be used over and over again. I've even put them in the washer. Too bad it is impossible to find the Heavy Duty Handi Wipes in retail stores.	&&&
Very soft. Good buy.	&&&
These nose wipes work well with our sensitive baby girl. She didn't have a reaction to them, and she doesn't mind us using them on her.	&&&
Love Lysol wipes. I trust these wipes to kill any germs and keep my house clean and healthy. They are convenient and well worth their cost. They are strong enough to scrub the bathroom with but gentle enough to wash desks down in my classroom.	&&&
These are great for my desk drawer at work. There are a lot more wipes in these than from the packs you can buy at the grocery store.	&&&
The best for cleaning cameras.	&&&
I bought two sets of wipes and used it twice on the same lenses a few weeks apart. It removed the yellow but didn't bring back the clarity to anything like the original. The finishing wipes left streaks.	&&&
My "baby" is 13 years old now and we are still buying Huggies wipes. They're not just for little bottoms. We keep a pack in every bathroom. I like that they are fragrance free and mostly water for the cleanest feel.	&&&
We like these wipes a lot, there is a definite difference between these and store brand wipes we have used, they are more wet.	&&&
This is perfect for my bathroom, and holds a lot of wipes. Nice design too! Happy with product.	&&&
love these for cleaning my cherry table and other wood surfaces. Can't find them in stores any more. These were the real thing, not a knock off brand.	&&&
I am not a fan of these wipes. I purchased a TON of them on a great sale on amazon (like 600 wipes for 1.00) but they are not soft at all and they tear pretty easy.	&&&
You can't beat the price. Get it with other subscriptions to save even more. Its great.	&&&
These wipes are a staple around our house. Not only do they do a great, streak-free job of cleaning and sanitizing, they're easy to use and the pop-up canisters they come in work flawlessly (unlike some cheaper brands where you always end up with some at the end that are dried out). Amazon's hassle-free packing made certain we got them out and put them to use within a minute or two. These are are a great addition to any household cleaning arsenal.	&&&
I use these for everything! I even do basic cleaning with them. I like the texture and how well they hold up.	&&&
I love theses wipe. My eye doctor put me on to these. Hey, if the doctor recommended, it must be good.	&&&
Fast shipping, as described..	&&&
Decent price for the amount and they work as intended!	&&&
Excellent product	&&&
Arrived quickly and is a good product.	&&&
I really like this product. Great for quick cleanups! Very convenient and great to have on hand.	&&&
gentle for newborns	&&&
I bought the large quantity pack of these....I love this wipes....I prefer to use a more natural surface cleaner in my kitchen and bathroom.	&&&
these are the best things to have around your house. so easy, quick, and convenient when you really need to REALLY clean something decently. the smell is okay too. AND after i use them, my hand also doesn't feel really dry (which can happen sometimes with cleansing products)	&&&
Awesome product and dirt cheap.	&&&
This is my first time trying these. Removes dark/very pigmented eye shadows with ease. Love them!	&&&
Great product--glad to get it in bulk.	&&&
Huggies natural care wipes Works great I recommend them for any child	&&&
Best product for at home hair coloring!	&&&
These wipes are thick and do a great job of cleaning little baby bums. I think I prefer Huggies wipes over other brands simply because they tend to feel thicker when I wipe. I hate feeling like I got poop on my hand, so these are great.	&&&
I like these but I think the one and done work a little better I wont mind spending the extra money on those next time. these work pretty good	&&&
This is the only brand of wipes I buy. Get's the job done and is sensitive on my sons skin!	&&&
I use Clorox wipes for everything...its amazing way to disinfect everything in the house..especially in the bathroom I am clean freak so this is a must have in my house.	&&&
Eh, these are okay. I always forget I even had them in the diaper bag so 9 times out of 10 I used a warm paper towel a baby wipe. Also, they dried out and weren't very moist after only being in my diaper bag for a couple of months. I wouldn't purchase them again.	&&&
These wipes are ok, but the smell is too much for us. We prefer the unsented.	&&&
Great wipes for on the go!	&&&
"As it says dry erase board wipes, so I bought this product to erase on the board but nothing moved or erased. only wipes away what was written immidiately not if something was written for a couple of hours and yes I was using dry erase markers."	&&&
It took a while to receive but the item worked quite well for removing "splat" hair dye that I had used.	&&&
We have an outdoor cat who gets very dirty. Easy to use, and the cat tolerates them. There is not a stong smell, which is great for a cat. And I feel like they will not hurt him if he licks his fur afterwards.	&&&
These wipes are a godsent! They are perfect for the car, work, office or at home. I use them for everything.	&&&
These work great when you are on the go and don't have water or eye glass cleaner handy to clean glasses. Work well, do not scratch plastic lenses.	&&&
Excellent product!	&&&
"Strong scent, but the smell doesn't linger. I love the convenience and the power behind the cleanser. I used the wipes in the kitchen and bathroom.
Pros: Lemony scent
Effective cleanser
Cons: The wipes can get off track if you don't pull them out correctly. Just take 10 more seconds to pull them out slowly."	&&&
"I received a free sample of this product to test and review. All opinions are mine.
I recently had my 5th natural child birth. This product gives me an easy way to take the gentle clensing and soothing I need with me whenever I go out. I use plain witch hazel and oil blends at home but those are very portable. These wipes are easy to throw in my purse when I leave the house. They are gentle to use, conveniently flushable, and soothing, especially when being out walking causes additional soreness."	&&&
These are awesome! I have some scar tissue from multiple kidney stones. Needless to say, I'm a little messy when I urinate. These are large pre-moistened towels but not so thick they won't break up easily. They smell nice but not overpowering. They make cleanup much easier. The fact they are individually wrapped is a big bonus. It's nice to be able to pop one in your pocket or even wallet just in case you need it.	&&&
I'm glad Aveeno created this product, I love cleansing wipes! my skin and eyes are super sensitive. With the new Ultra Calming makeup removing wipes I had no issues with my skin and eyes turning red, the wipes worked fantastic removing my mascara and eyeliner. My skin feels great and clean!	&&&
Great wipes! I tried buying the cheaper brands, and they were ok, but seemed smaller to me. I like the size and feel of these wipes and was able to use less wipes to clean up messes. Since they are the sensitive brand, they do not have an overly powerful scent but still leave baby fresh and clean.	&&&
Absolutely wonderful! These little wipes have a an amazing scent and are extremely gentle on the skin! They're perfect for on-the-go too :) I tested these SweetSpot Labs wipes for free, but all opinions are my own.	&&&
Extremely disappointed in these wipes because usually Babyganics products have been very good. But these wipes smell terrible (must be that oil blend?), dry out practically overnight in any of the wipe warmers I've used them in, and don't even seem to clean well.	&&&
I keep worrying that the wipes are going to dry out because the closing mechanism doesn't seem very secure... but the wipes have not dried out and it's been a month! It holds a reasonable amount of wipes for a few days on the go.	&&&
Hemrroids run in the family and this helps with us females to control the flare ups. This helps with the irritation and burning sensation. It is cool to contact with the skin. Its a rapid relief as well.	&&&
I like these wipes. They remove make up and don't leave my face feeling gross.	&&&
I love these wipes I use them to wipe my sons face and hands too they don't irritate him when he has a rash	&&&
After the sensitive wipes, these are our second favorite. The scent is pleasant, there's nice quilting, and fewer wipes can be used per change. And bonus, they keep the mess from getting everywhere!	&&&
Fans of Lysol Wipes will no doubt love this Amazon deal. Great price and you get the extra large 80-wipe bottles (a total of 240 wipes for the 3pack). I love the lemon scent, it's clean without being too intense. I keep a bottle in my car, kitchen and bathroom and take the to-go packs to the gym. As others have pointed out, a quick swipe won't completely disinfect a large surface, but I can immediately tell a difference. It's sometimes shocking how much dirt these pick up. I give it a solid recommendation.	&&&
I have very sensitive skin and almost anything I use leaves me red in the face. Not these awesome wipes. I don't use a lot of makeup because of my sensitivity but I always use sunscreen. These wipes refresh and clean my face at the end of the day. They are larger and thicker than other wipes I have tried and the don't disintegrate in your hands during use. There is a slight scent but not too strong. these leave my skin feeling silky at the end of the day. This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

When I first opened several wipes ripped before I could get them out. An everytime 3 or 4 wipes pull out not just one. The overall cleanliness feeling is great, however I'm not sure I'd but this product again. :/	&&&
I was looking for unscented wipes for long time because my son has allergies. I have been using the unscented wipes for few month with great success. No allergy reactions and works better than other brands	&&&
I bought these when my daughter was having runny noses / stuffed noses. With these wipes I can easily clean her nose up without any screaming or struggles. Thank you to whomever created these!	&&&
I received the ultra-calming make-up removing wipes and was very excited to try them. The package was easy to open and allowed for easy resealing so you knew the wipes wouldn't dry out which is so often the problem with these other wipes. The scent was fresh and not overwhelming. The wipes were not too saturated which is typically my second complaint about this type of product. The wipes are very effective at removing make-up. I do feel like it left a little bit of a film on my skin, although that diminished with a little bit of time and drying.This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

My boys battle some sinus problems during the season changes (especially spring) and with the constant nose blowing those little noses get sore! Boogie wipes definitely help prevent soreness and redness. Also with the gross "Crusties"!	&&&
These makeup wipes are the best! They remove ANY and ALL waterproof mascara!	&&&
Most feminine wipes come in bulky 30-packs so the individual packaging of these is nice because you can bring them to work or class without having to tote around a giant package that looks like baby wipes! I got these for free from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.	&&&
"This Package of Disposable Facial Wipes is Great for Applying Toner and Removing Make Up. The 'Gold Cosmetics' Wipes are Professional Quality for Estheticians, Cosmetologists, Skin Care Professionals, Make Up Artists, Nail Technicians and Etc. They are Perfect for Applying Facial Product. The Cloths Do Not Absorb Much and Therefore Save More of your Product for your Face.

This Package is Extra Large. It Comes with 200 Cloths. I Like that it Will Last a Very Long Time. I Love that these Wipes are Non Woven and Lint Free. They Work Really Well for Removing my Eye Make Up. No More Ruining my Washcloths with Black Stains. These Cloths Also Work Great for Removing Nail Polish. I Love that they Don't Leave Lint Behind.

I Would Definitely Recommend these Facial Wipes. The Package is Huge and the Wipes are a Great Quality. They are 4 Inches Square Folded and Unfold to 8 Inches Square. The Price is Very Reasonable Too.

A Sample of this Product was Provided or Offered at a Discount in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion.. My Review is Solely Based on my Own Thoughts & Experiences with this Product.. I Hope they (and Included Pictures) have Helped You.."	&&&
My go to wipes are Kirkland brand, The Honest Company, and these. They are thick, moist, and get the job done for a great price. Packaging is very convenient with the flip lid.	&&&
The Aveen Ultra-Calming Wipes are so convenient to use. It did a great job of getting all my makeup off. It was gentle on my skin as well. Left me feeling clean and fresh. Love the texture of the wipes, was gentle but you still felt like it was doing a great job of getting my face clean. This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap.

I like to use Clorox wipes in my kitchen and bathroom. These ones have "micro scrubbers" - I hate the way they feel on my hand, but they work well in the bathroom - especially the sink (gets the toothpaste off lickety split). Was hoping they would work well on my kitchen counters, but you still have to really scrub to get stuff off and the texture on my hands made it always feel as it was leaving little micro scrubbers behind (which it probably doesn't, but it felt that way). They are okay - but probably won't get them again.	&&&
Always been a fan of huggies wipes. Thick and never fail...if you know what I mean	&&&
These are great for vacation when you want to wear a lot of makeup and don't want to get makeup all over hotel towels when you have to wash off.	&&&
Don't like the material used for the wipes. Feels like a damp dryer sheet. I prefer the wet cloth ones.	&&&
Love these wipes, just enough fragrance and strong.	&&&
I am a runner with the WMRC West Midtown Run Club. These guys came out and let us sample them and I am hooked. I use them way more often than I thought I ever would. I can't say enough about them they are pretty awesome and easy to carry around with you. So I am buying my mother a set so she can try for herself.	&&&
Have a weird smell, but works well.	&&&
I like these. They remind me of Huggies wipes but not quite as thick. I like that they don't have as many bad ingredients too. I gave 4 stars because they aren't as wet. But, if you do shake the box around you can redistribute the liquid.	&&&
Love Huggies Naturals. Thick and do a great job.	&&&
These wipes make it great and easy for my little helpers to help out. We use them for everything, counters, bathrooms, kitchens and everything else. These make it easy to use 1 wipe at a time and extremely convenient. I feel they disinfect what ever I use them for. They are great!	&&&
These are great for baby's dry nose, better than tissues. And they smell yummy!	&&&
Love these because they do not irritate my children. They are not too thick or thin - just right!	&&&
These are amazing! We put half a cube in our spray bottle and its lasted us over a month so far! One package of these cubes will last us a year! Smells good and cleans our baby very well.	&&&
If you like then abd amazon doesnt charge taxes go for it. But if you are i woukd recomend checking the walmart store brand or suoermarket storebrand i have found they are cheaper. Pampers in here are .02 per unit while my supermarket brand are .017 and they are thicker.	&&&
Holds the perfect amount of wipes for long trips but fits really easily into the diaper bag.	&&&
Love these wipes! Durable and great price! Much better than Huggies and Pampers!	&&&
I love these wipes!! They are the best, super absorbent and thick! I love how they are soft to our baby's skin, and smell good too!!	&&&
Good product, wipes could be bigger, but overall it does the job	&&&
Usually we prefer regular Pampers wipes, but the packaging of 'Kandoo' ones makes them really convenient for traveling.	&&&
Love pampers wipes. Especially the pop top soft packages! Easy to take anywhere and store all over the house!	&&&
We received the Buti-pods on time and as advertised. We have been using them a few days now and they have worked great. The wipes were easy to load in, the zipper opens and closes easily, and the wipes do not seem to be drying out at all. I love that they don't look babyish. My 8 year old is asking to take a case to school with her for use during her day there. If they continue working this well, we will be buying two more cases, so we can have one in each bathroom and one in each backpack.	&&&
I love the softness of Pampers Sensitive Baby Wipes. I use it for my baby and even for me!!	&&&
Best wipes hands down. Super gentle! Fragrance free!! No complaints! Wish they sold bigger bulk for less $$!! We buy boxes of these at a time because the 552 count box with free prime shipping makes these absolute lowest cost!	&&&
These are okay - only thing I don't like is the style of packaging. Wipes of all styles and such seem to come in these "pop up" canisters but I've to ever have one actually work as such.	&&&
Warms the wipes without drying them out. Easy to add new wipes. Works great especially for night time newborn diaper changes!	&&&
really like these wipes especially if your child has sensitive skin. great product for a great price	&&&
good stuff,	&&&
LOVE these baby wipes!! It's a great deal to do the amazon subscription too!!! Pampers is our preferred brand of baby products and these wipes do not disappoint! They smell nice, work well, and DON'T LEAVE RASHES!! I couldn't be happier!	&&&
I bought these for a camping trip. They do wipe you off but I wasn't crazy about the tea tree smell. I would have preferred to just use baby wipes.	&&&
I like the Huggies natural care wipes because they're natural. But just like other wipes I average 2-3 per diaper.	&&&
I bought this travel wipe holder to replace the one that originally came with our diaper bag. The original kept popping open, so our wipes kept drying out. I love that this wipe dispenser stays securely latched and it's slim design fits nicely in my diaper bag. What else do you need in a wipe dispenser?	&&&
So much easier than fiddling with other models to open the top and replace wipes etc. Highly recommend	&&&
They work great, the only thing is that they dry up rather quickly. You must make sure to completely seal it.	&&&
I much prefer the One and Done wipes but these do get the job done. A little smaller and not as great a scent as One and Done but I would buy hem again	&&&
I'm breastfeeding, and have been applying a nipple cream that needs to be wiped off prior to nursing. Remembering to get a wet rag was a pain, so I ended up using these pacifier wipes, as they don't have any alcohol on them (so it won't dry my nipples out) and doesn't have any chemical taste (so it won't discourage my newborn from feeding). Not what it was meant for - but has come in really handy!	&&&
These are the only wipes that I use! My kids all have sensitive skin, and these wipes have never caused any irritation. They are thicker than other brands and are not too wet which is an added plus. They are the best for cleaning hands, faces, and bottoms!	&&&
These wipes ate the best! I have them around all the time especially when I babysit. All the little kids enjoy them and makes it easy easier for me.	&&&
The machine itself is ok, but I wanted the machine similar to one I had in the past, with just two brushes and no water tanks.	&&&
I use to buy rags in a box these are a better value and much stronger	&&&
Does not scrub as hard as I would have liked. Water bucket and pick up bucket too small to do any size of room.	&&&
super dry and do not remove water proof mascara.	&&&
OK! The best thing I have ever purchased. With dogs in the house (rescue work & foster), I use this multiple times a day on my kitchen tile and hardwood floors. I NO LONGER have to scrub the floor on my hands and knees. I've even recommended this to my FB friends! I'm thinking of buying another as a "backup" just in case this is discontinued EVER.	&&&
Great money saver. Works well and is much cheaper than the store I was buying them from.	&&&
This are the best wipes vs money you will find in the market!	&&&
Use these for my babies as well as for myself when going potty.	&&&
"Not sure what the other reviewers were saying ""its too small"". The wipes are big enough, in my opinion. About the size of a full open hand from end to ends. If it were any bigger, not sure if I would want to use the entirety of it, since it would probably get dirty to use an entire wipe..

I use mine to wipe any tracking from the litter box and at times the bottom of my cat, and there has been absolutely no issues with the cat not liking the scent, etc.."	&&&
not a fan of this product. i'd gave it less stars if it's more expensive. the wipe is thick and after wiping it leaves a layer of lotion on the skin that is causing me itch. not sure what's going on.	&&&
The wipes are not odorless. The odor is unpleasant.	&&&
We have been using these wipes since our daughter came home from the hospital. They clean well and are gentle on her skin.	&&&
Amazing product! Best cleaner on the market!	&&&
Best wipes out there. No smell, no residue. Gets the job done on the baby booty!	&&&
These wipes are strong and great for clean up after messy meals.	&&&
"I use the boogie wipes when my son has a runny nose. They are very gentle on his skin and feel like silk when they are completely dry. I like the fact that they are not too small or not too big just the right size. The scented ones smell really good. I wish they had some that had eucalyptus in them."	&&&
We've been really happy with these. They work well and don't seem to cause any skin reactions.	&&&
Good size for adults, hypoallergenic & residue free. Great value for price, came in a timely fashion, ordered online.	&&&
These wipes are amazing! They are so gentle on my kids nose and doesn't cause it to get raw and tender like it does using regular tissue. My kids love the smell of them and they don't put up a fight when blowing their nose anymore. Definitely need to buy some and keep stocked!	&&&
I like the scent but my son was sensitive to the scent. Also, the wipes are hard to tear off when pulling from the wipe container. They don't come off so easily.	&&&
I wish it was a little bit thicker. It's too thin that I need to use more wipes. I found the perfect wipes: Honest Company wipes is much more thicker and durable and I believe it's about the same price.	&&&
I am a member of Smiley 360. I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Regardless, opinions are 100% my own. Preparation H Medicated Wipes for Women are a great choice for traveling and on the go. They fit in a small purse or even a pocket. An excellent option for business trips or vacations. They are very soft to the touch and have almost no scent. They definitely provide the relief you need anytime. .	&&&
I like the way it polishes the stainless steel, but the wipes are rolled in the container in a way they will not dispense in the container have to take them out of container and tear of the sheets. Have had them before was great but something has changed. will not buy again.	&&&
"My husband would give these a 5 star review. He loves Pampers wipes and thinks they clean fantastically.
I however would give this a 3 star review. The wipes are too wet and slippery to clean anything up. I feel like when I'm done I need to towel my son off because he's so wet and that just causes diaper rash that much quicker."	&&&
Walked out with one package in my hand, used said wipe and was only able to finish one foot. I had to walk around all day with one foot with polish and one without. The wipe dried out very fast.	&&&
They were awesome!	&&&
My son has eczema so these wipes work well. Glad I can buy them in bulk so that it saves me several trips to the store!	&&&
I chose this 3 packed sanitizing wipes for my kid's school. Good thing is the ingredients are natural, but there are no seals for individual bottles. Some of them will be dried before my kids uses them.	&&&
Work well, even on my waterproof eyeliner. Pleasantly non-scented. Much better than the sensitive skin wipes by Burts Bees – those made me break out AND they smelled horrible!	&&&
These are great wipes. They do not contain the chemicals found in a lot of other baby wipes. They are also not too wet or oily. Gentle on the skin as well. I highly recommend this product.	&&&
Lots and lots of my favorite baby wipes in a nice travel size. The purple print fit right in with my daughter's baby shower theme, too!	&&&
These are the only diaper wipes we buy for our 3 month old. She has sensitive skin and we haven't had any problems out of w. Just the right amount of moisture to the wipes and she hasnt had a diaper rash since we started using these. Of course we use these wipes in coordination with Desitin to help prevent rashes	&&&
Awesome purchase. I love Huggies brand and normally can't afford them but this bundle made it easier and is much more cost effective than buying single packages of them.	&&&
An excellent product	&&&
I buy these wipes becuase i like the price,but i think they dry out too fast.	&&&
"""I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.""
I received and tried Preparation H Medicated Wipes for Women and was pleasantly surprised at how effective and soothing they were. I was always embarrassed to purchase them but as one ages, that embarrassment gives way to necessity. The soothing aloe, cucumber and chamomile left my skin hydrated and comfortable. The medicated wipe was discreet enough to carry in my pocket and was easy to dispose of. I would recommend Preparation H Medicated Wipes for Women for its effectiveness and soothing qualities."	&&&
The top quarter of the package is always dry so I store them upside down and this has made a great deal of change and I now like them just as much as pampers wipes...well actually a whole lot more as they are half the price!!!!! Definitely worth the product for the cost!	&&&
Great product! I've been using this brand since my daughter was born.	&&&
"quite variable as to moisture content of each packet, would have preferred wetter
...........also, comparing with other sweat pad product, the longevity of use was
definitely not nearly as good. Minimal effect for half the time. Also, I am sedentary
and couldn't expect these to work well if I was working."	&&&
These are great, I use this for my kids, they are moisture and prevents nose rashing!	&&&
These are great. They get the job done with a minimum amount of wipes. We get these through subscribe and save and it is just soooo convenient.	&&&
I received a free product via Smiley360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. This product works great and I like how discreet the wipes are for you can throw them in your purse and your ready to go, so much better then the wipes!	&&&
They occassionally tear apart when wiping baby's bottom.	&&&
Great case but wish it held more wipes. I now carry a separate refill package of wipes along with this case because I've run out before and a Macdonald's napkin just doesn't work as well.	&&&
Love these wipes. They work amazing and when my kids have had diaper rash they didn;t sting at all.	&&&
Really like these nose wipes. They are gentle and clean my daughters skin without drying it out.	&&&
Its scent isn't as strong as the regular pampers wipes which I like, and they are much softer than the huggies wipes.	&&&
Natural Care wipes are the only wipes we buy for our little guy. They are gentle on the skin, yet get the job done.	&&&
Pampers wipes are only ones my newborn can use. Baby breaks out from other cheaper brands. Perfect size for cleanliness. Right amount out wetness in each one.	&&&
I love that these wipes are soft and get everything clean. I would recommend these wipes for any baby bottom!	&&&
Got this off of a baby shower registry as a gift for an expecting friend. This came in plastic sealed so there are no worries about the wipes drying out. I know my friend (and myself) prefer wipes that are unscented so they do not irritate sensitive skin and I often find scented products to be much too fragrant. These exceeded expectations.	&&&
"After reading all of the negative reviews, I felt it necessary to leave my own review. I use 3 wipes at a time on each of my black leather seats. When I am finished, the seats are greasy look wet. You let it all soak in. I do this on a sunday evening, and when I take off to leave monday morning, the seats look and feel great.

I also use these on my wife's grey leather in her car. I use the same method and the next morning, the look and feel great. The GREASY feeling is gone. These are the best wipes I have ever used on my leather. They do work. You just need to be smarter than what you are working with."	&&&
I am really happy with these wipes. We have two boys in diapers right now so we go through a lot of wipes. These ones are thicker than our usual wipes and work really well. The wipes do not pull up the next one so that is a little annoying when using a plastic wipe container. This is the only downside we have seen since we started using these. They come in a big bag but there is 6 individual packs of wipes in the bag. These have no scent and they also do not have several other ingredients that can be harmful. These wipes are gentle and work nicely when your baby has diaper rash. I am really happy with these wipes. **I received this product for free or a discounted price in exchange for an honest unbiased review. This has not influenced my opinions on the product! I have written honestly about my feelings and experiences with the product.**	&&&
i've got this free from Smiley. and this is my first time using this product and it turned out great! i do not have hemorrhoids very often, but once i have it, it's very uncomfortable. this wipe takes care of me in that regard and i highly recommend it.	&&&
sent them to college with my son!	&&&
Great quality and easy to wash for the next use.	&&&
I LOVE THESE!! I use them as handy-wipes but also to wipe off my desk at work and it leaves my office smelling wonderful. Everyone loves these.	&&&
Awesome wipes for the price. Will buy them every time!	&&&
I like the wipes a lot they are good when your on the go	&&&
I have been using these wipes for years and they have changed everything about them that made them great. They are now thin, dry, USELESS. CEO should be fired. I just canceled my subscription and am considering throwing away the packages I have left. Complete crap.	&&&
There is a very strong smell to these wipes. I read good things about them (in terms of helping clear people's skin), but I could not continue to use them due to the smell that it left after using it.	&&&
Aveeno Ultra-Calming Makeup Removing Wipes are gentle on your skin, cleans very effectively, love this product	&&&
The only wipes I will use. They are durable and safe for baby's delicate skin.	&&&
I'm so happy sephora is carrying this brand! These wipes literally smell like coconut cream pie. They're ingenious little things and feel wonderful on the skin. Great for taking on the go. The packaging is 10/10 too.	&&&
Our little girl has always had a sensitive bottom. She rashes easily with most other products except pampers! The quality is really good. These wipes are extra moistened and they clean gently. They do leave the bottom a little wet, so I would just wave my hand to help air dry before I would close the diaper. We love these and buy them for our friends who are having babies. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Seems stupid, but they wipe my sons nose clean much faster and better than regular wipes. Plus they do not run his poor little nose raw like regular wipes.	&&&
I personally don't like anything that claims to be unscented. When there is no scent it leaves you with a rancid urine type smell that I don't like. Could just be me but I personally like to have the Baby Fresh scent. Other than that they are great wipes!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes are great!! They are great to use after working out at the gym when you feel icky, or to just freshen up after a long time. Not only that, they are packed so conveniently! Influenster sent me this product to test out for free, but these are my own opinions. I will definitely be purchasing this product.	&&&
Boogie Wipes are perfect for that kids who hates to have his or her nose wiped! The boogers are softened and easily removed! Definitely something to carry in your purse or diaper bag.	&&&
I love these wipes. They are a perfect thickness. They clean babys bottom effortlessly!I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own	&&&
I love the smell of the grape Boogie Wipes & I was pleasantly surprised how much easier they are on his nose to keep it from chapping than tissues. They're nice during cold & allergy seasons for less fighting when going to wipe his nose.	&&&
I took my 3 year old grandson on his first vacation and the wipes came in handy. I would recommend taking boogiewipes where ever you go!!!	&&&
I would be lost without these wipes! I use them all over the house!	&&&
I tested SweetSpot Labs for free, but all opinions are my own. These wipes are super convenient, easy to carry, and effective. However, I did not like either of the two scents I tried out. I would prefer no-scent or maybe a minimal flower scent that people won't notice.	&&&
Best I've used for my sensitive bottom. I always regret having to use other kinds of wipes when I run out of these. I like that I get so many in one order and they last.	&&&
Wipes are very cheap, very thin.	&&&
I have two baby girls and we go through a lot of baby wipes. The Bloom Baby wipes were strong so you didn't have to use a bunch for the dirty diapers which made them last longer than other wipes. I also liked that they were sensitive and made from 98% natural ingredients. one of my daughters has very sensitive skin and Bloom Baby didn't bother her bottom at all! The author of this review received a free sample of this product.	&&&
I use pamper wipes on AJ's little bottom, to wipe his little face and hand AJ even bites on them. I love the smell of the wipes and the texture. I hate that there not reusable but that OKAY with us.	&&&
Been using these for about 2 years. They`re great, especially when you get a bag of 250 wipes. You can put them everywhere! Great price too.	&&&
LOVE these wipes. they're the only ones i use, they're thick, unscented, and they haven't given my baby a diaper rash. "I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review. I really enjoyed using AVEENO® ULTRA-CALMING® MAKEUP REMOVING WIPES. They are really gentle especially around my eyes. Some makeup wipes would irritate my eyes and these did not. They also have a slight clean smelling scent which makes them nice to use. They took off all of my makeup including my mascara. I will definitely buy them!	&&&
I first started using these wipes shortly after my daughter was born, and I've been using them for about 5 months now. These are the most amazing wipes ever! They are so soft and have never given her a diaper rash- although almost every other brand does. Not only that but it is easier to clean when she has a dirty diaper than with any other brand I've tried also. The 400 count lasts a very long time because I have found you need to use less. I'm not sure what the big difference is between other brands and babyganics but there is a huge one and if you try these once you'll be hooked!	&&&
THE BEST WIPES I'VE EVER USED	&&&
the wipes worked pretty good on cleaning my monitor and tv screen	&&&
They smell great and work great too. Kids love that they are their own potty training wipes.	&&&
"I ordered an 8-pk through the Subscribe & Save program, but gave most packages away. These dry out my son's skin and they're way too rough. If I wipe him with them, he gets very upset and says they hurt his bum. I regularly use Maximum Strength Desitin liberally on my son, and even with that, his skin would get irritated by these wipes.

If you have a ""Miralax kid"" who often needs helping cleaning up, I'd recommend keeping a box of regular baby wipes in the bathroom and squirting the box of wipes with baby oil. The baby oil won't dry out the skin, and it's effective and gentle in cleaning up a child's bum. Regular baby wipes are not flushable, but honestly the less you flush down your toilet, the better off your household plumbing will be.

As my son gets older, I might consider the Cottonelle wipes if my son needs something more than toilet paper to clean up, but I won't be buying these again and don't recommend them."	&&&
Fast service, great product!	&&&
Fast shipping, When i got the box, you can smell the fresh scent.. I wont be buying wipes anytime soon..	&&&
Will save you lots of money. It really works.	&&&
Best Aliexpress seller for musical accessories, good prices and good products, thank you.	&&&
"Ok. So first I want to say that most of my family (meaning everyone but me) has my wife's sensitive skin. She's a redhead with the pale complexion and all our kids inherited her skin type and tone. Two of the people in my household have significant allergies that cause eczema rash. As such, we don't use products with perfumes or dyes. When I saw these wash cloths I thought they may be something we could use to help keep all that sensitive skin clean and happy. I was not disappointed. I know that these are supposed to be wash cloths for babies but our family ages 3-36 is using them. They are generous in size. Extremely soft. They hold lather well. Rinse easy. They wash well without damage in the washing machine. And then go back upstairs for reuse. We could not be more pleased with this item and plan to purchase more of these in the future. Who wants to use a regular synthetic fiber wash cloth when you can use these?!

I was provided this item ad a discounted price in exchange for an honest unbiased evaluation."	&&&
Love these wipes. I am not a neat freak or even a very clean person. But now that I have a container of these wipes all over the house- we are a much cleaner household. They make it so easy to quickly clean up messes- no need for rags, solutions and lots of time. Just grab one (close the container!!!) and go. I didn't realize how grimy my doorknobs and light switches were!! So great for wiping down the inside of the sink or the top of the stove too. Only reason they are not a 5 star is that to completely disinfect it needs to be wet for a bit longer than I can typically remember. So not great (for me at least) for disinfecting. But amazing to get grime up!	&&&
These are all I use! They remove makeup that is left over even after washing my face at night and removes even my most intense eye makeup too, love them! My only suggestion would be to create a different opening as the more I use them the harder it is to keep the top closed and the wipes get a little dried out.	&&&
I love having these handy, gives you a refreshed feeling, without having to wash your face. They are pretty good for being wipes, but I definitely couldn't go too long without washing my face afterwards.	&&&
I love these wipes - way more substantial than papmers	&&&
these wipes are not bad for the price. I like that they are somewhat textured, makes messy diapers a little easier. However, they are a bit thin and pull apart/tear easily. And they do have a bit of an odd smell to them.	&&&
"At .02 a wipe, this is a really good deal for a good product. I have also tried the Babyganics and Huggies brand wipes, and I prefer these. Even my husband asked, ""Where are the good ones?"" when we ran out and were using another brand. I find them to be thicker and wetter, and they work well on my little one. Plus, I find them handy to clean up lots of other messes, too! I don't know that my baby has especially sensitive skin, but it's a sensitive area so I would rather err on the side of caution.

As a busy mom, I love having these delivered right to my doorstep and getting enough at one time that I don't have to worry about running out. I did have one delivery that was lost by the carrier, but Amazon customer service resolved it in a manner that made me happy."	&&&
Near perfect solution for wet wipes in a normal bathroom environment. Overall, a tad bigger than I'd like in overall form, but sturdy, seals well, and weighed center helps retrieve one sheet at a time.	&&&
This is only three large sacks of wipes. You need to have bought the container that they go it elsewhere	&&&
These things are pricey but they seem to be worth it. My kid gets a chronic runny nose a few times a year and I hate seeing her rub it raw with regular tissues. For awhile I was using baby wipes but she hated the smell of those so I found these and she doesn't seem to mind them at all. I like that they are unscented and I can use them even to wipe her face without her pushing me away.	&&&
I have been using them for years. They are the softest wipes I have found that don't irritate baby's bum	&&&
Love these wipes! They gently remove dirt & makeup,but moisturize after! I'll definitely buy more!	&&&
I love these wipes! The cost, quantity and quality are fantastic!	&&&
Hate the bleach smell most wipes have. These are great though, the smell is suttle but my house smells clean!	&&&
We've tried several wipes from Seventh Generation, Honest, Babyganics, and Huggies (it was a gift). This is BY FAR our fav wipe. It's a good size, doesn't feel as dry as some of the others, and one Earth's Best wipe gets the job done while we end up using 2 of the other (green) brands I mentioned above. And this is coming from someone who LOVES Honest diapers.	&&&
These wipes are super-portable and do a great job of cleaning my glasses. The price of each one allows me to use them without guilt.	&&&
I am in love with these washcloths. I was skeptical to start with as I was thinking of the bamboo I had always seen as being rough. Boy was i wrong, these washcloths were extremely soft. I wanted to just keep feeling them against my skin when I opened the package. I was very impressed with the size of them too, they are 10.6" x 10.6" which is really good sized for a baby washcloth. I love that they are not filled with dye or harsh chemicals. They are also naturally hypoallergenic, antibacterial and antimicrobial. A good for baby or you product that feels so wonderful. They come wrapped in adorable bows around each washcloth so they would make a great gift for a baby shower. I have decided though that I need to keep these for myself. What better way to get clean than a two sided bamboo fiber cloth that cleans completely yet gently. These are really great for your face as they will not scratch. These washcloths are made durable as they have lockstitch to ensure that they do not fall apart easily. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for new washcloths. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.	&&&
These work great, especially when used alongside a weekly soak (same brand). Just getting ready to order some more boxes!	&&&
I just love the scent of this wipes + they are very practicable	&&&
I prefer Pampers sensitive wipes over huggies because they are softer and more gentle than Huggies wipes. My son's skin is very sensitive.	&&&
Perfect wipes for a new baby. We bought a large box before our baby was born. We wanted scent free ones while he's small just in case he had a sensitive bottom. We love the thickness and they feel nice and moist and soft. We tried others that we got as gifts and they just cant compare. We love all huggies wipes.	&&&
These disinfecting wipes are the best. So easy to use. I keep one in the kitchen and each bathroom and one at school. Easy to reach for to quickly clean up.	&&&
These wipes are great! My daughter didn't break out at all using these and they are very wet!	&&&
I like this product a lot. It does good things for my skin and it's handy for traveling. I took one star away because I wish the cloths were a little softer, especially when you're working at getting mascara off. Overall pretty good!	&&&
When I used this product I was completely satisfied! It didn't leave behind any flakes which is always good!	&&&
I like that they're natural & don't have chemical ingredients!	&&&
great product. this is the only type of wipes I used for both of my children.	&&&
I decided to give these a try when I signed up for Amazon Mom. Not only are there a TON of wipes in each container, but they are thick and strong. They are moist and have a really fresh scent to them. I would highly recommend these.	&&&
My favorite face wipes!	&&&
Great wipes not to wet not to dry just perfect me and my family love them they are also soft. they also work to clean almost anything! i use them in my car sometimes if there is a spill or to clean tables at restaurants	&&&
I love how well these wipes work. They leave my skin feeling clean and soft after every use. Highly recommended!	&&&
The Purell hand wipes were received in a timely manner, and are much appreciated! They come in handy for a musician (fiddler) that likes to have snacks during brief breaks at gigs! He can snack AND have time to clean his hands before picking up his fiddle again! :)	&&&
These are the only kind of wipes I trust on my little one's bottom. Any other brand of wipe causes an instant rash. They are also a generous size and have just enough moisture to do the job. I just wish we could subscribe and save for the 7 count pack. They are perfect to use as refills for the tubs.	&&&
My favorite wipes. Thicker and so much better than Pampers!	&&&
Good for brushing his teeth and for when he's teething. He would chew on wipes but now he can chew these and there his favorite flavor	&&&
We've used these wipes since day one. I carry them everywhere we go!	&&&
These wipes are AMAZING! They are soft and gentle, not at all perfumey, and they cut right through makeup without feeling like you're scrubbing your face off!	&&&
This is a baby shower gift.	&&&
Best wipes ever! Can get them cheaper at Costco.	&&&
Pampers Sensitive wipes are hands down the best out there! They are the only brand I'll buy. The Pampers Sensitive wipe is soft and gentle, never leaving the baby raw or irritated. I tried other brands given as a baby shower gift, and they rip or tear, and don't do near as good of a job as Pampers.	&&&
These liners/wipes are amazing for cleaning up baby messes. I just get them wet and squeeze out the excess water, rip into about three or four pieces for wiping. One wipe usually does the trick. They are a great way to keep toxic chemicals off of precious, delicate baby skin. I love that they are made from a quick growing, renewable resource (Bamboo). They also work quite nicely for removing make-up, especially around the delicate eye area. Use with a little bit of coconut oil or your choice of make-up remover and they're perfect.	&&&
I found the wipes to be very dry so I wound up using more to do the job. I used up what I had an plan to go back to another brand.	&&&
"I love these baby wipes. They are kind of on the thick side and textured. I used to buy Sams generic but every since ther recall they have not sold them anymore. I have spent a lot of money trying to find a baby wipe we liked after that. We have tried several with results varying from too thin, too hard to get out of package, ripping apart trying to get out of package. These are the ones we have been purchasing.
Amazon also sells the refill packages which is what I currently purchase on amazons subscribe & save."	&&&
These are great. So much easier on my hands (Harsh chemical cleaning wipes I've used in the past have hurt my hands) and these cleans wonderfully. Plus, peace of mind knowing it's safe for humans and animals. Some people think it smells different, but I like the smell personally. Make the switch!	&&&
Love these wipes. They are lightly scented, not too strong and they're thick so you don't have to use as many. There's always coupons for them so you can save a few dollars which is always great	&&&
"I received this product to facilitate my review, all opinions are my own.

WaterWipes, widely available in Europe have finally arrived in the US and I couldn't be happier! I love the fact that they only contain two ingredients ( 99.9% pure Irish water and 0.1% grapefruit seed extract) and are chemical free! My little one has very eczema-prone skin and our current ""sensitive"" commercial wipes were cracking/drying my hands so badly, I worried about what it was actually doing to his bottom (not to mention an occasional use on his face!).

I once tried making DIY baby wipes but found not only was the process time consuming, but the portability to be a negative factor.

WaterWipes offer a subtle scent and are durable in material! Since WaterWipes do not contain preservatives, I appreciated the provided information on how to care for them! The package has a use by date of 15 months un-opened and is recommended for use 1 month after opening. If water separation occurs just turn upside down to redistribute water! Easy peasy! Since WaterWipes are not interfolded, it maintains the sterile environment! This was definitely something else that had concerned me with the make-your-own wipes, I had tried!

I am thrilled with the quality and performance of WaterWipes! That combined with the safer and more natural care my child (and my hands) benefit from is the reason we will continue to use them in our home!"	&&&
It is so handy to buy a box of these wipes and bring individually wrapped wipes wherever we go! The best place for pricing is Amazon.	&&&
My wife and I are both avid athletes and live in a very sunny, hot climate. We wear our glasses and sunglasses all the time and often get sweat and finger prints on them, especially after workouts. We've tried getting the small multipacks of wipes but found they usually dried out or didn't last long. These individually wrapped wipes are a great alternative. We keep a box near our door and grab them on the way out. We've even kept them in the cat during the hot southern summer without any drying out. This is a great options!	&&&
I love these boogie wipes! They are amazing! My daughter is teething right now and her nose is on a consistent run. And these wipes are pretty much one and done. It's great. And they don't dry out your babies nose	&&&
Ordered these to keep at work. I swear it helps cut down on germs in the office. Will always have these around; flu season is all year round at the office!	&&&
I buy parents choice wipes they work don't rip easy and gets the job done. Good price and comes with more wipes. One big box last month in our house even my elementary girls use them instead of toilet paper.	&&&
How about some instructions with this product. Sure I can look online but I'd rather not have to. I am loading the wipes in by stuffing them through the middle and distributing left and right, but I suspect there is a different way. At any rate, most wipes come on as a single, but every once in a while I get a handful. The product is good, sturdy, but to not have instructions was a bit inconvenient.	&&&
If I am using disposable wipes, these are my go to wipes. Very strong wipes. Strongest I have ever used!	&&&
We bought these for my youngest daughter and found that the wipes are not cut uniformly and some aren't cut all the way through. This really is a pain when you get the giant wipe for a little wet diaper or a tiny cut wipe for a big messy poo. I definitely prefer their competitor, as their wipes come completely cut and are merely folded together.	&&&
I've noticed some of the cheaper off brand wipes have a weird smell to them. I love these Huggies natural care wipes. Makes it easy to clean up a nasty poop and leaves baby smelling clean! And it's easy on baby's sensitive skin	&&&
These are the best wipes I've used so far. They are super soft and durable, but they aren't impossible to tear when you only need half a wipes.	&&&
We love these baby wipes! It's soft. It wipes clean. No perfume smell.	&&&
Huggies Natural Baby Care Wipes are my favorite, because they are thick and one wipe really does the job. I also like how it is natural. My son tends to have sensitive skin. if I use any other baby wipe, and Huggies Natural Baby Care Wipes is butt will get really red. I would recommend this product for parents that have a baby with sensitive skin.	&&&
These wipes are great when your child has sensitive skin. All three of my boys have sensitive skin and these wipes have helped a lot!	&&&
I buy bought the Pampers baby wipes for my grand-daughter and her skin is very sensitive, this products fragrance is too strong, I personally could not take the smell. So I through them out and I had to buy another box of wipes.	&&&
Perfect for my needs	&&&
Not happy with this product, wipes are too thin.	&&&
This is not moisturizer! It is SPF only! Burns my eyes :-(	&&&
These are perfect! I live in a forest so a residue gets on my counters. The scrubby side is the best cure I've found!	&&&
I am a major fan of Pamper's Sensitive Wipes, they are the only wipes I can use without giving my kids a rash. Must be allergies, but at least I have one kind of wipes I can count on! Plus they don't dry out in the wipes warmer like other wipes do!	&&&
These are great! Love the scent and love how soft and gentle they are. A lot better on little noses than a regular wipe is.	&&&
These wipes are amazing! I use these on a daily base. Clorox disinfecting wipes smell great and do a great job of killing the germs around the house. Everyone should try this product.	&&&
These were exactly what I wanted. Order handled promptly.	&&&
these wipes are too thin and the generic ones are much better. I will pay extra for huggies wipes which i feel are the best and you use alot less because of their thickness.	&&&
Everything is great	&&&
Love the portability and small size of these. They do a very good touch up job on previously cleaned pieces that have been handled or worn and need refreshing. I make jewelry and re-purpose/restore vintage pieces. These are great on the road at craft shows when you don't want the mess of a liquid cleaner. I keep one in my repair kit and on my workbench. A dazzling shine often makes the sale!	&&&
I wish they still carried them in our store and not just online...	&&&
These seem to clean the dogs teeth well. The only con is they are very strong smelling of Mint or wintergreen. Dogs do not seem to like the smell.	&&&
they are so soft, my child likes all pampers wipes	&&&
To me, the operative word is "singles'. I have always been able to purchase wipes, but not in a handy form that I can carry in my pocket and keep in my vehicles for emergencies without drying out the entire 100 count package.	&&&
"On opening the canister, the first thing I noticed that was different from the last time I purchased this product was the lack of an inner liner. That's fine with me as long as the product comes from an online retailer, but I would not like it if I bought it at a store where the possibility of someone contaminating it would be real.
The scent seems lighter, but that might be my memory (or my nose) getting older!
I use it mostly for cleaning the toilet seat and surrounding areas when we have male guests.
Honestly, do some gents just wave it about after...oh well, I digress, lol!
Bottom line, using a disinfecting product is sometimes a necessary evil."	&&&
I don't have sensitive skin but love these wipes. Makeup tends to bother my skin when I wear it too much these lil wipes completely remove makeup without irritating my face. Love them!!	&&&
Love these wipes. Why can't all wipes have ingredients that you actually know what it is. I don't feel bad even using them on my daughter's face or hands. The only thing I prefer is if the sheets came out one after the other instead of having to dig back in the package sometimes.	&&&
Gets the screens clean and streak free, easy to use."}},	&&&
Do not buy these! I had been using these wipes on my children when they started potty training, and continued using them for a while. I just found out from the plumber that THESE ARE NOT SEPTIC SAFE. I will not buy these again.	&&&
I would like to see Sam's carry them back in the store	&&&
"I love these HUGGIES One & Done Refreshing Baby Wipes, Refill, 648 Count.

I have a 7 month and a 22 month and I use a lot of wipes.

These Huggie wipes are perfect for my lil ones they both have sensitive skin and these wipes are soft and gentle.

Also a great value.

New and Improved! Thicker baby wipes with a unique texture that helps grab the mess to help you get more done with one versus Huggies Simply Clean wipes.

They smell great! Refreshing cucumber and green tea scent baby wipes for a bath-like clean.

Huggies One and Done Refreshing Refill Packs have a resealable closure to keep your diaper wipe supply fresh and moist.

Choose the right wipe for your baby and the right style for you: Case pack, Portable Soft Pack, Refill Pack, and Pop-Up Tub wipes dispenser.

I highly recommend this product!"	&&&
Love these wipes, they do a good job of removing makeup, and don't irritate my eyes or leave a sticky residue on the skin. I love the smell too, like real fresh coconuts, really pleasant and not overpowering.	&&&
Love these wipes. They are natural and refreshing, and if you are reading this, then you probably already know the many benefits of ACV. These wipes have so many uses -- great to throw in your bag to have them with you always. The vinegar odor dissipates immediately, so no worries about that. ACV is a great antiseptic, cleaner, and these towelettes make a great face wipe.	&&&
Love these wipes. I can not use the store wipes anymore.	&&&
I loved the smell of the wipes as soon as I opened the package. The wipes were very gentle on my eyes and did not sting them as other brands have. They worked well to wash my face.	&&&
Not "Thick Strong Wipe" cannister - this one is without that notation. I thought wrongly these were tougher than the ordinary Lyol Wipes since they added "tough" to the description. That was misleading. The are the regular Lysol wipes no different. I can get a better deal on the three canister webpage, The morning breeze smell in my opinion, is nauseating. I do not like it and I am in grumpy mood because I thought this was a special tougher wipe product and it is not.	&&&
These wipes are great for newborns, but are a bit too soft for use once the little one has started solids- they are soft and easy on the skin, but lack the texture needed for 'sticky' issues.	&&&
We use these wipes whenever our kids get sick. It's so helpful when the mucus gets stuck on their faces. It's easy to carry around and helps to keep their noses from getting raw.	&&&
I am so happy with this product. I have been using this product for my three year old since she was an infant. I buy the 3 pack because we use this all the time. I never leave home without it! My daughter hates when I don't use the Boogie Wipes. I highly recommend this product to every parent out there!	&&&
I don't usually go for products that are scented. My kids both have very sensitive skin. A friend of mine let me borrow some of these and they worked great as I had expected. What I didn't expect was that amazing smell! And nope, didn't affect my kids' skin at all. I'm blown away and happy to be a repeat customer of Boogie Wipes.	&&&
These wipes are perfect for my baby's sensitive skin!	&&&
These wipes are great. typically you have to go over the surface many times to clean it with these it only take 1 wipe!	&&&
These wipes are the greatest. I use them in the car when we have messy hands.	&&&
Lysol means clean... serious clean. I love this stuff. The wipes are easy to use, convenience, no mess. They pop out of the containers with no issues. Perfect for wiping door knobs, countertops, toilets, sinks... heck, I even use them on my stovetop and microwave! Great value!	&&&
Love, love the Pampers Sensitive wipes. Great product.	&&&
Pampers Sensitive Wipes are gentle on baby's skin and cleans up well. prevents baby rash	&&&
We love these wipes! We use them everywhere- in our car for quick hand washing, in the bathroom, with our baby, after meals, during/after art projects, etc! We have used Parents Choice Sensitive Baby Wipes for years and love how soft and easy on the skin they are.	&&&
They're OK. Could just the same use leather cleaner used on my couch.	&&&
Wife and baby love these wipes! It helps the wipes wet if you keep the packages upside down until you need it.	&&&
I have used these wipes for years and like that they stay moist for many years if packets are unopened. When SAMS stores quit carrying them I was thrilled to find them on line. They came 3 days after we ordered them.	&&&
Simply the best. The appropriate amount of moisture--not too wet , not to dry. Definitely worth it to go for name brand and not generic with this product. Trust me on this one.	&&&
Good wipes, made for sensitive skin. My baby has extremely sensitive skin, and these certainly help. Nothing too special though, they're just wet wipes.	&&&
I really love the boogie wipes! They are gentler on the skin than a regular diaper wipe, especially when the kids are sick and have dried boogies after sleeping. These are a great purchase and I always keep them handy!	&&&
I really love these wipes and signed up for them on my subscribe and save, but when I received one pack was moldy so it had to be thrown out.	&&&
I started buying these a year ago because my kids have allergies and there noses run constantly and tissues were making there noses raw and bleed so we tried boogie wipes and they are amazing there are the only thing we use now. My kids even have to take one to bed with them. My husband and I have also used them they are awesome and smell so good and are soft and durable. My family loves the grape scent boogie wipes?????? My kids always ask and make sure we have boogie wipes in the house and car. We love them.	&&&
These wipes are great for when you are on the go especially during that time of the month and they smell AMAZING! Tested free but all opinions are my own.	&&&
"I will start by saying I did NOT receive this product for a discount besides that I get with prime. That being said I am continuously plagued with trying to find a good toner I like. Most the ones I used in the past had alcohol and dried out my skin which is hard to do since I live in the very humid south.

I have tried a lot of new toners. I have not had a allergic reaction to one yet and even if I did I do not rate products on if I have a negative reaction such as rashes or a unusual burning. It is not the products fault if someone is allergic unless nearly every seems to have the same negative reaction. Anyways back on topic, out of all the toners I've tried this is by far my favorite.

It does not leave me feeling sticky like most of the natural toners I have tried. It it has not blocked my pours and it does not burn (unless I have and open sore where I picked at a zit which is normal).

I have not notice any benefits as of yet as far as my scars and post marks go but I have a problem with picking at my face so I'm going to give it a little more time.

The only reason I could not give it 5 stars is that the smell is rather off puting. It doesn't smell so strongly that I can not use it but it doesn't smell very pleasant either. It his apple vinegar however so it makes sense that it would smell similar.

I will be buying these in the future especially as toners to go. I will still be on the look out for a Toner I can give a solid 5 stars to but till then these are definitely for me.

I would like to note that I did try to use these as a face wash wipes because I really need a good wipe while I am working a 12 hour shift. However the smell is not pleasant enough nor does it have the same 'clean' feel that I feel a wash should have. So this review is strictly on how these work as a toner."	&&&
I've been using Fresh Scent Boogie Wipes for my children for the past 3 years now. Heck even my husband prefers using them to Kleenex. I'm constantly restocking. They are wonderful when the little ones get colds and they don't leave the skin around their noses raw and puffy. I love them!	&&&
Sensitive wipes are great. My baby doesn't have extremely sensitive skin but these are good and durable. Would recommend to another for sure.	&&&
This Warmer is a great product. It keeps wipes moist and warm and it keeps baby happy during changes. He hated cold wipes and this did the trick. It is compatible with any wipe brand you choose and is really worth the expense. Be sure to follow instructions re moistening pads in machine and you are good to go. Very happy with purchase.	&&&
We love them I try a few different brands before I bought this so far best wipes I try	&&&
As so many places provide hand sanitizer, these wipes seem a bit unecessary. Hand sanitizer causes my hands to become so dry I have to apply moisturizer every every time I use it. This is very inconvenient when I'm on the go. These wipes are soft and gentle, do not smell like alcohol, and can travel anywhere. I keep them in my car, my purse and carrying on luggage.	&&&
"These wipes are really good. Thick, big, come out easily, and most of all they can be used for wiping messy faces and little hands.
I was very happy with the product!"	&&&
Stopped working within four months. Cannot return the warmer, because it stopped heating the wipes just weeks after the return window ended. Very frustrating. It had been very well taken care of, never moved, never dropped, etc.	&&&
Our family loves these Kandoo Flushable wipes. My son really likes to use them and it helps him look forward to potty training.	&&&
Wrestling grandson uses this product after every match. Will continue to buy.	&&&
Super wet with extra liquid in there, unlike some products. They also don't have an offensive medicinal smell like some wipes I've used. I will purchase again, esp. for the price. Good solid product for sanitizing, and cutting dirt.	&&&
These wipes clean and polish my stainless steel appliances perfectly. I will never use sprays to clean my appliances.	&&&
Cats do not like it. I'll use the whole box but will not order again.	&&&
"These wash cloths are much thicker than I had anticipated. I love that they are naturally antibacterial. I am always worried, living in a warm, humid climate, that they will become filled with gross bacteria. I have been using them for a week now and they haven’t accumulated that slime that I usually get with my cotton wash cloths. I also love that they are much softer than cotton.

I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional cost in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true and honest opinion."	&&&
Didn't clean like it said. Doesn't look like new. Did wipe some crud off	&&&
Lysol disenfecting wipes are great. They do great on cleaning up any mess. I use them all over the house especially the kitchen and bathroom	&&&
Works well for an overall stainless steel wipe to shine up appliances. Not for scrubbing tough grime.	&&&
I was given this product in exchange for an honest review. WOULD MAKE A NICE GIFT	&&&
These wipes are not easily teared like some wipes can be. It is good quality. The scent is not too strong and quite pleasant. Moreover, the fragrance is non-irritating	&&&
I LOVE wine wipes. They really work. They do taste bad, but it's not as bad as everyone is complaining about honestly. They are really life changing though. I also use it, and every time I use it, I show it off to everyone I'm with. Worth every penny. Really.	&&&
I was so hoping these would work, but my baby end up getting a rash only after 3-4days of using these. Another review mentioned that they disintegrate in your hand and I have to agree.	&&&
"I don't know why but I ordered these thinking they were wet and so when I got them, I was annoyed but I LOVE THESE WIPES!!! I am so glad I purchased them! I own 3 dogs, I have horrible allergies and kids. I have used the following dusting things (some I still currently own)

Endust
Better Life
I own a swifter
Pledge multi surface
Micro fiber wand
Liquid Gold Dust and Go
I'm missing a few things, but you get the idea.

They have either made the hairs fly around or it leaves a wet mess on my blinds and so you're stuck with clumps of dust/dog hair. The only thing I used that I was some what happy with was the Swifter and I was still not completely happy. I spent way to much time dusting.

I am 100% happy with these. I used them on my blinds and stuff wasn't flying, no clumps, I used this on my banister and I didn't have to repeat over and over.

These will be the only thing I ever buy for dusting"	&&&
I'm surprised to see that no one else has had this same issue that I am. I walked into the nursery and smelled a musty sort of burning smell and found that the sponge under the wipes in the warmer was brown and burning. I'm going to try and return it today...I was also disappointed with how bulky this item is -Since it didn't fit in the console of my change table, I had to place it on the actual change pad.	&&&
These are fantastic little wipes. I used to use a different, large brand name, but all I felt that they did was make my lady parts perfume-y. Plus, they were so wet that it left my bits in need of a pat dry. Intimore products are different. They are just moist enough to do the job without extra moisture. The scent is very light, but because of whatever they use, my bits feel refreshed and clean.Great for on the go after a workout, during your monthly cycle, etc. I always keep a couple of these in my purse ready to use. BTW, they also work great to freshen your underarms, should you feel the need and you are in a pinch!!	&&&
These wipes leave a fuzzy residue on the skin. They smell very nice but, leave fuzz on the skin.	&&&
"These smell really yummy, which is distracting to babies/toddlers. They dissolve dried on "boogies" quickly and with minimal pressure, so you don't have to wipe like crazy on a sore nose! I keep a pack in the diaper bag and one at home so I never have to go without!"	&&&
Perfect for our sensitive skin baby!	&&&
Great price. Great product that smells so amazing like baby powder.	&&&
This is an automatic addition to any baby gift I give to anyone for baby showers. I love the fresh scent and it really helps with the comfort on those little snotty baby noses!	&&&
What can I say about baby wipes? lol These were thing and got the job done leaving my little man toosh nice and clean .	&&&
We buy the big refill boxes of these wipes and are completely satisfied. I love the quality and the price!	&&&
These are a must in every classroom for students and even homes. For a fresh scent and a germ free area, Lysol Disinfecting Wipes are great!	&&&
Didn't work as promised	&&&
Not a big fan of these wipes, they are very thin and do not handle big messes well. I much prefer the huggies naturals wipes.	&&&
Great, still in use, after several years.	&&&
I absolutely love these, they smell fresh and they don't dry out my skin like a lot of other wipes. Removes make up surprisingly well too!	&&&
As expected great wipes	&&&
My son has that teething nose and allergies so these have been amazing! My husband laughed at me for getting them but I saw a marked difference immediately and really need to go buy more...	&&&
So soft. I received this at a discount, during a promotion, in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I love these. They are bigger than I expected which is a great thing. The came in a nice package and each one had a cute green bow on it. The wash cloths are very soft. I was not sure what the fabric would feel like since its bamboo. When I think about a wood type of material I think of hard material. This is my first iLuvBamboo product and I love it.The washcloths absorb water nicely and help my soap lather nice compared to the old washcloths I have. The cloths are what they call double sided and sewn so they wont unravel after a few uses. When they are wet, they feel like a soft puff of cloth, wiping my skin nicely. I have very sensitive skin so the regular cloths scratched me. I know these will be a great addition to my daughters baby shower package, I am sending her. I will update with her review as soon as she uses them. I know she will love them just as much as I do.	&&&
Pampers has all the best wipes. I mostly prefer sensitive but these are a very close second	&&&
This wipe warmer is absolutely the best! I cannot say enough about it! It really does keep wipes warm! When I say warm don't expect to have wipes that just came out of a microwave! They are just "warm" enough to take the chill out of wipes right out of the package! Unlike the wipe warmers of the past (like I had with my first son eight years ago) this warmer does not dry out the wipes or burn them! The hearing mechanism is in the top of the warmer and not the bottom so you never have to worry about wasted dried out wipes and you never have to wet a sponge to keep them moist! It is really a no brainier to fill and I love the added night light! It even has a clear front area where you can see if you are getting low on wipes! Dex really got this warmer right! I will be ordering another one for another area of my house and adding this to my list of go to gifts for new moms!	&&&
Perfect organizer to keep things neat and looks nice in the living room instead of the clutter/mess diapers & wipes bring. I tote it across the house to where I need it : )	&&&
As expected.	&&&
works great	&&&
Soft and gentle wipes for dirty little puppy ears. These easily clean out dirt and extra wax that can get built up in the fur without a lot of rubbing. Would highly recommend these to anyone.	&&&
As far as looks go, its pretty nice... but its only about 70% sealed... thus I am sure the wipes will dry out much faster than my cheaper tubs... I may return it... going to test it out for a little bit	&&&
I really love these washcloths! I originally purchased these to be reusable baby wipes, however I couldn't resist trying them out myself. They feel luxurious! They are the perfect thickness, very soft, and nicely sized (not too big).	&&&
Good wipes, a little too thin for using on tough diaper issues	&&&
These things are amazing. I used to just use my shirt to clean my glasses, but last year my roommate got me to use these and nothing else has ever cleaned my glasses as well since!	&&&
The wipes are warm, but that heat doesn't last long. If you add a little water to the wipes the heat tends to stay a little longer.	&&&
I didn't think there were many differences among facial makeup wipes but apparently there is. I've used a variety of brains, mostly neutrogena but also cheap ELF packs. These however were likely the source of breakouts which I *never* have. Three pimples in the space of 5 days and I quit using them.	&&&
I do not like the packaging. I've had two lids break on me since I've started using them, so I place them in different containers. Will be removing these from my subscribe and save	&&&
With my daughter, I had tried almost all kinds of sensitive wipes available in the market but she would still get frequent diaper rash and redness in the diaper area. So, my mom would always suggest that I wipe her diaper area clean with cotton dipped in water, but who does not love the convenience of baby wipes. I always wanted a chemical-free wipe that would care for my baby and her skin as much as I do. I still remember my daughter's delicate skin when she was a newborn. It was so much thinner than what it is now. With more than 10 diaper changes a day on average, the chemicals kept sticking to her causing all kinds of diaper rash. Then I learnt about WaterWipes - a premier European brand. I was super impressed with its ingredients - 99.9% pure Irish water and 0.1% grapefruit seed extract. I tried one wipe on my face first. It felt as pure and fresh as washing face with water and patting dry with a towel. Then I tried Waterwipes with my daughter and loved how after the most nasty diaper changes, I could still clean her fresh without adding in any chemicals or perfume. I could also use it to wipe my baby's face and hands after feeding. I strongly recommend Water wipes to all mothers from day one. I received this product to facilitate my review, all opinions are my own.	&&&
Lint free, no scratches. Beats paying $75 plus for sensor cleaning. Best I have used, and about half what I pay local.	&&&
I really like the wipes. They're very strong and absorbent. Yes they're a bit "wetter" than other wipes but I'd rather have it that way vs dry. With them being so moist they work great in my wipe warmer and don't dry out as fast. Another bonus is the bags they come in zip shut so they don't dry out and they provided me with another container to store them in which is nice because I can keep some downstairs	&&&
Thanks to these gentle wipes my daughter has been free from rashes! The wipes are strong, but gentle on baby's skin. Definitely worth the cost to me, and they do not cost much more than other wipes anyway. I have used Huggies in the past and they fell apart easily and gave my daughter a nasty rash.	&&&
works well	&&&
Was a little skeptical about it, but after a week of use was really impressed. Fantastic product that gets tv make up off with no residue. Skin left feeling fresh and clean!	&&&
We have used these wipes since the very beginning with my little one (now 18 months old). I started with these since they were sensitive enough for a newborns' skin, but stuck with them because we liked them so much. The wipes are relatively large in size, and they are very soft. We have never had an issue with break-outs/rashes with them.	&&&
I love Pampers wipes, they are so soft and smooth for my babies bum. Can't wait to use up the other brand I bought and get back to using my pampers.	&&&
With stainless appliances this is often part of the routine in the kitchen. Milky at first but after a short while really enhances the stainless	&&&
Very handy when you need a quick clean on just about anything ! I keep these in the bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. The wipes are nice and moist and clean very well.	&&&
Love these! They are SO much better than huggies wipes. They are thick and uniformly cut and work wonderfully on my little one's super sensitive bum. I will always recommend pampers sensitive wipes!	&&&
The pampers and huggies wipes went way up in price, these work the same if not better! Almost a whole dollar cheaper and amazing! They don't tear and you can get the most out of every wipe	&&&
Switching to this product was a awesome move. The wipes are a good size and make me feel very fresh. I like that they can be used on any part of the body and they have a good scent to them. Doesn't rip like the Cottenelle version of this which i switched to but went back to these of course. The plastic box container does not hold an airtight seal as much an i would have liked. I ha to frequently add water to the box to re-hydrate the product. However i found a different box to store them in and i continue to but the Charmin brand refills instead.	&&&
These are our favorite wipes and these packs are a good size for a diaper bag.	&&&
These wipes are very convenient and I carry them in my lunch kit everyday. These are very large wipes and do an excellent job if you are out and about. I will certainly order them again.	&&&
Pampers wipes will always be my first choice when it comes to quality and affordibility! I couldn't ask for a better product! They are soft on my babys bottom, and I only have to use one every diaper change, why?? Cause they are just that great!	&&&
"These wipes have an excellent clean fragrance that is very pleasant. This 3 pack gives me enough to place one container in each bathroom and one in the kitchen. I particularly like that the wipes are now easy to feed into the dispenser. I used to worry about losing a finger but no more! They simply slot into the holder without risk of injury. Well done, Lysol.

These wipes are not intended for creating a sterile environment or preparing a surface for surgery. They are household wipes, meant to be a quick and effective clean up for spills and grime. They are so useful for that purpose and help me keep a cleaner house more easily. I'd give up paper towels before I'd stop using these. Excellent # for the money. In addition to receiving these through the Vine program, I am also a buyer through Subscribe and Save. I buy them and love them, an enthusiastic 5 stars."	&&&
These wipes work great on our little guy. Keep in mind, even though these are sensitive, your baby may not like them or have some type of reaction. I'd recommend trying a few types before committing to a huge count like this. Nevertheless once you determine which brand is right for you might as well save some money!	&&&
Use them for doing dishes and they are great. Will continue to order them	&&&
I'm a new mother and I love them for any child or new born baby	&&&
I am a mother of a 21 month old, and a 4 month old, and i've used this product on both of my children. I've tried other brands and always go back to this one. My son was a bit sensitive as a newborn/infant and this was the perfect product! The best part, they offer it at costco in bulk!	&&&
The only wipes I'll use! Very soft and I like that they are unscented, hypoallergenic, and leave your hands feeling clean after using them and not sticky/soapy.	&&&

I love softness of the wipes	&&&
These are great for kids just learning how to wipe! Highly recommend!!	&&&
These are thick and smell great at a great price. I had problems with the simply clean ripping while I was cleaning my son with them. These are thicker and I haven't had a rip yet. They have a nice clean smell to them. I use fewer of these per diaper change than any other wipe I've used.	&&&
These makeup removing wipes leave my skin feeling amazing and so clean! They remove all the makeup without leaving my skin feeling oily. I use these before I go to bed or after I get off work to make my skin feel replenished. In my opinion these are some of the best makeup removing wipes I have ever used. I would recommend these to all my girlfriends because they are so amazing.	&&&
So you're probably wondering if you really need Boogie Wipes. I honestly donâ??t know what I did before I discovered this product. It easily removes crusty boogers from little noses with just a couple of swipes without hurting. There are no questionable chemicals to worry about a product that is to be used on sensitive baby faces. I use these not only for icky noses, but for messy faces and hands too. Iâ??ve used them to remove crusty eye boogers and smeared messes that end up in babyâ??s ears and hair after a night of restlessly sleeping because of a cold. And we all know that babyâ??s get sick SO MUCH. I keep a pack on every level of my home and in my diaper bag. Do not hesitate to try this product.	&&&
"This is very nice looking and works really well. It keeps the flushable wipes moist because it has a silicone seal all around and the weight allows you to pull one wipe at a time without the next one coming out. It's got a super easy open and close function with just a small push on the center. It smaller than the other wipe boxes that you get with most wipes and it's not cheap looking plastic so it looks nice.
It's better than having to throw away dry wipes (I actually wet them and use them to wipe out the sink, why waste them?) or struggle with pulling one at a time. I'm very pleased with it. I'm happy someone thought of this."	&&&
Great wipes! We haven't used anything else and never will!	&&&
The pressurized air is very wet so I'm nervous about using it for my keyboard often. The wipes are a bit dry and scratchy, so once again, nervous about using them on my brand new touchscreen laptop... But the do work alright. Wish the wipes cleaned better, rather than just smudging stuff around.	&&&
I am a first time mother and pampers wipes cleans my baby really well and leaves her smelling so fresh	&&&
I like the One and Done because they are a little bigger and thicker, but the refill package isn't great. The wipes don't rip at the perforation and it is a struggle getting them separated.	&&&
we only use these wipes. when someone used others on her she broke out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
"With 2 grandkids in diapers and pull-ups, I constantly use baby wipes. These baby wipes really have stood up to their name. They are nice and thick and get the job done. When the diaper is very loose, I usually still need 2 wipes to get the job cleaned up.

I prefer to use Huggies wipes since they are thick and I don't have to use a lot of them. I use them everyday to wipe hands, faces and dirty bottoms. They are great to take along with you to restaurants and to the park.

I certainly recommend trying these. They will save you money in the long run."	&&&
I received a sample of the Simple Skincare Micellar Make-Up Remover Wipes from VoxBox and they are great! They're so soft on my skin and take all the makeup off with no problem. I like using them before bed to get all my makeup off before going to bed at night, and my skin is nice and clear in the morning. Great product!	&&&
These makeup removing wipes are incredible! With the magical power of micellar water they remove every spec of stubborn makeup. They do not strip my skin of moisture and the cloth texture is super gentle on my skin. I use these on a daily basis and will rely on them while traveling over the busy wedding season! Give them a try!	&&&
I have been these wipes for quite sometime,you can find them everywhere in my home,backpack,car.I love the fresh scent,great for face,hand clean up and any other wasted messes that come unexpectly.	&&&
A bit disappointed. It takes several wipes to get my glasses clean, and they still leave behind streaks.	&&&
I have been using the Boogie wipes with both of my children, since my oldest was an infant. He will be turning 6 this summer. They were the only product that was sensitive enough to use to wipe their noses. Tissues always dried up their noses, no matter what kind we used!	&&&
I love these wipes! I was a daycare provider for 10 years before I had children, and used MANY kinds of wipes. These were by far my favorite. Since then I have used these for 8 years with my 4 children. They are tough, they stay wet, and they do their DOOTY without making a mess. The fragrance isn't obnoxious like some wipes as well. These are used for way more than diaper changes in our house as well. Cleaning faces, cleaning toys, dusting shelves, cleaning sticky off of - ahem - everything! They are a great product to have around the house! None of my kids have ever had a reaction to these wipes, which is great since they all have had reactions to certain diaper brands. Great product. Used for way more than diapers!	&&&
Wipes are good..but tub is flimsy...broke on first use. Next time would prefer flip top	&&&
I've been using these wipes on my daughter since the day she was born! She is now 21 months old, and I still use them. I won't use any other wipe... The quality is bar none better than any other wipe out there. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These are still the best facial and make-up removing wipes I have ever used, compared to Olivela, Burt's Bees, and Equate. They're a really good size to get your eye makeup, face, and neck, leave your skin nice and matte, and do not sting your eyes. I love that Yes doesn't test on animals and the cucumber line is always a reliable go-to for sensitive skin."}	&&&
These wipes are the best! The price is wonderful and they are top quality. Actually i like these better than the higher end brands.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes and ingredients are decent too.	&&&
This wipes are gentle on my son's skin, free rahes.. \rBest product for my kids	&&&
SUPER impressed with AVEENO® ULTRA-CALMING® MAKEUP REMOVING WIPES. They even remove permanent marker from skin, talk about impressive! They are amazing at removing make up and leave skin feeling refreshed!!!	&&&
"I have these auto-shipped each month from Subscribe & Save. I don't have a baby but I use these wipes for everything. I'm a beauty blogger so it's really handy to have these to wipe off makeup, makeup swatches, etc. These are refills so they don't come with a plastic bin. I've been using the same plastic bin for years and I love getting refills so it's less plastic waste. Each package has a ziplock seal so if you don't have bin you can really still use these since they are resealable.

I took off one star because it does burn a bit if you don't have your eyes closed and if you wipe off lipstick the taste is strong, which is odd to me for something labeled ""natural."" Of course, the definition of ""natural"" is so obscure these days so not too big of a deal. The price is right and I highly recommend them."	&&&
Great wipes, been using them for two years on my son who has sensitive skin. I like that they're super strong and big too.	&&&
"It does warm the wipes when plugged in but once it unplugged it doesn't last warm. I feel I wasted my money on it and the bad thing I can't return it because I bought it with a gift card and once I bought it I threw away the gift card, And now the box."	&&&
These wipes worked amazing and I highly recommend them to other ladies.. They had an extremely clean after feeling.	&&&
they do the job...	&&&
Great deal. I feel like 200 will last me forever. I have read that people say these leave streaks but I have not had any issues. I use these wipes to clean my phone screen and also my lcd screen on my camera.	&&&
These are the best baby wipes EVER. I will never use anything else on my kids. I wish they came in a larger qty and wre easier to remove fro the packaging.	&&&
My 4 month old daughter has extremely sensitive skin and these wipes are perfect for her. I love that they don't tear apart in "sticky" situations, unlike other brands we've tried.	&&&
Yes, perhaps we spoil our toddler a bit with these moistened wipes. But because we do use them when he has a runny nose, he's happy to tell us when he needs a wipe and doesn't run away from us when he sees us coming with a Boogie wipe. Sucks that it's not biodegradeable though.	&&&
Love these disinfecting wipes. So easy to use and can take them anywhere. I keep them in our bathroom and an extra in the car, just in case we have any spills. These wipes come in handy all the time. Love them	&&&
These work well on my cats but i think they tend to be a bit over priced.	&&&
great for cleaning lenses.	&&&
Works well. convient packs.	&&&
I use the boogie wipes to clean my daughter's face...not just her nose. I love how the boogie wipes are made with saline and don't irritate her skin out like wipes do.	&&&
Excellent product. Far superior than the cheap "blue" towels.	&&&
These are really good for me as a mom since im starting to potty train my 2 years he can learn to flush down the wipes he just likes to flush the toilet but not to sit on it yet. But i got to start somewhere.	&&&
"The 6 Pack of Bamboo Baby Washcloths from Naturally Nature are the softest, best sized washcloths I've ever used. I wish I had these for my sons when they were babies! I use these for my face, to remove an exfoliating mask or to dry my skin, after washing. These are so soft and thick but also very lightweight. They will dry quickly without having a chance to sour. I love the colors: 2 Each of Light Bamboo Green, Natural Off White And Natural Light Yellow. These are made of eco friendly, sustainable bamboo. If you've never felt bamboo fabric, it is so luxuriously soft and comfortable, high quality, long lasting and durable! I would definitely recommend these for a baby shower gift. They come in a cute presentation with each washcloth rolled and tied with a tiny polka-dot ribbon, perfect for gifting.
Note: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. All thoughts expressed in this review are my own opinions."	&&&
I discovered these accidentally when my daughter got her first cold as a baby, and we're still using them five years later. They're not for use in place of tissues- they're great for when you miss all that snot while it's wet. The saline in them gently and quickly dissolves the dried-on stuff that accumulates under your kid's nose... and on his cheeks.. and in his eyebrows... and everywhere else. My daughter is sensitive to scents and prefers the unscented ones, but I d on't mind the scent of these, and neither does my son. And even my daughter admits these are better than scrubbing with a dry Kleenex or a harsh washcloth! We use these for just about every cold to hit our household.	&&&
Functional but they smell like baby diaper wipes... That said, the odor does not have much staying power and my mask is clean.	&&&
"It is a gr8 buy! My son always cried during diaper changes wit cold wipes. I bought this rather than the expensive brand and it works just as well. I dont fill up too many wipes in them just abt half n keep refilling them bc some times they r too wet. My son now loves diaper changes and he doesnt alwYs pee with cold wipes. Lol
Its been only two weeks since iam using this so its def worth it. I have the box in case if something does happen. Its portable so i like tht too. Makes it easier to take arnd the house."	&&&
I love these not only for wiping her pacifier that falls on the ground a million times a day, but I also use these to clean my breast pump accessories. It's a bit cheaper than the Medela wipes and although smaller, they do the job and keep the parts clean when I pump at work or traveling.	&&&
I like these face wipes. A little pricey for the how many there are, but they do their job and get off 90% of my make up.	&&&
Great product! I have a white Maltese with tear stains and spent a fortune on all those cleaners that promise to remove the gunk, but do not. I ordered these wipes (Earthbath is a great product) and they gently cleaned all the gunk from her eyes and also got rid of the smell. As for the staining, I use peroxide on a Q-tip, with my Vet's approval, rinse off with cotton balls soaked in water. Be very careful of the eyes though. As for daily cleaning, these wipes take care of the rest. Very happy, and highly recommend them and all Earthbath products.	&&&
I am so glad with my purchase. I arrived on the time and perfect! Like i was waiting. Then i point the company to everybody!	&&&
I got these wipes from hospital and got fan of these, then I bought them from local store and became fan of these wipes as they are gentle, cleans good and dont irritate the skin. One thing is they dry up quickly if the pack is left open.	&&&
So far so good	&&&
Only slightly better in performance than the diapers. A total gimmick for the gullible. See other complaints on manufacturing and trouble shutting down auto order.	&&&
Works good, but came a little dry.	&&&
Great Product	&&&
I'm so glad I purchased these wipes. My daughter is so sensitive to store bought baby wipes. These are exactly what we needed.	&&&
I have recently started wearing eyeglasses and had been having a really hard time cleaning them properly using a cloth and the formula the optometrist gave me. It's much easier with these, but I still need to burn 2 or 3 packets to get my glasses clean. This may be due to my poor technique, but I would still only give these 3 out of 5 stars because they're basically just moist paper towels. I would recommend them anyways because I haven't found anything better.	&&&
"A must have for hikers, urban explorers, or anyone who can't avoid getting sweaty to or from work (those of you lucky enough to ride a bike to the office, for example).

The shower pill is pretty expensive at $1 per use, but when you stink from a long day out and about and can't get to a shower before needing to get cleaned up, these are absolutely invaluable. I've used about 5-6 so far and every time I'm surprised by how one sheet (and they're not very big at all) can absorb/eliminate dirt from pretty much your whole body.

I don't know what kind of black magic they use to make these things, but I fully support it."	&&&
"These are great and this is a great price! They are always moist when I get them - some of the cheaper brands
turn dry very fast these do not."	&&&
great product :)	&&&
Love having these on hand. I have one in each bathroom and one in my kitchen. The 3 pack is a perfect combo for me!	&&&
We prefer these wipes over a others. They aren't too dry or too wet. They are strong. They smell nice	&&&
These work fine. They do rollup if you're trying to wipe down a larger surface (Table, playmat, etc).	&&&
Best lens wet wipes. I used to use flents wipe n clean but this one is much better. Recommended!	&&&
Love Lysol disinfecting wipes! I keep some in the kitchen, bathrooms and car. They're durable and great for quick clean ups on any surface. They have a clean scent and don't leave behind any sticky residue.	&&&
Came on time. Just so happy to have found these for my favorite mop! They fit perfectly and work great!	&&&
These wipes are great. Soft, strong, big, moist but not soggy or soapy. They really feel like fabric. The price is just gilding the lily. I don't ever want to purchase another brand of wipe.	&&&
Thank you	&&&
"I really loved this wipes. Well also the skin of my daughter loved it. The texture is really cool. :)
I really recommend it! !! ?"	&&&
So convenient to have it shipped to me and at a very good price! Whenever i'm down to my last two packages of wipes I order more.	&&&
Good wipes, they have a nice light scent and they're durable and thick so you don't need to use so many. Added bonus is there are coupons of them in the flyers all the time!	&&&
I love these, sturdy towlettes, and easy for cleanups. I even love the leftover solution when the wipes are gone, I put it in a spray bottle and use it to the last drop.	&&&
These are good wipes for the price. They are strong and what I like is that there is no scent in them.	&&&
Great to refill the warmer. Comes in very large bags.	&&&
High quality, resistant, perfect amount of moisture and great value. Our favorite wipes by a landslide.	&&&
Great price compared to name brands! I would buy again if price beats in-store pricing. These are thicker than the store brand wipes I've purchased in the past. They aren't quite as nice as the name brand, but that's expected at this price point.	&&&
These wipes are great - they are gentle on baby's sensitive skin, and they hold together really well, not tearing and falling apart like other brands I've tried. They also work really well in wipe warmers - I use the munchkin brand warmer with them and have had great results.	&&&
Very handy. Work well.	&&&
These are fabulous for your little ones coming out of diapers. With these single dispenser wipes, you can be sure your newly potty trained child won't clog the toilet! They also smell great yet are gentle on a tiny hiney :)	&&&
Difficult to knock these wipes, they do a great job and the chemical in them gets grease from fingerprints off and then evaporates… but the problem is that the chemical in them evaporates from the CLOTH too dang fast, it’s impossible to clean a 27” Mac Cinema display with one wipe, by the time you get the whole surface it’s dry as the sahara desert. What we’ve resorted to doing at work is using a blue spray like monster screen cleaner and a micro-fiber cloth first to get the fingerprints off; and then tearing one of these open and INSANELY FAST - going over the whole screen to polish it. that seems to be working best for us. I would really be interested in buying the chemical in these in a spray bottle to use with a microfiber.	&&&
Love these flushable wipes. It was my first time using these and definitely will be buying again. I really liked the open close on top being more than just a little clear plastic piece. It helped them not dry out.	&&&
Reasonable price-cleans equipment well	&&&
I love it didn't have to go to store	&&&
"We love these paw wipes. We've been using them for about 4 months now. We use them on a 16 lb shih tzu and an 11 lb yorkie. I originally bought them with the intention of using them once in a blue moon, but we were so impressed/disgusted with the amount of dirt we got off their paws, we now use them after every walk. (I use one wipe for both dogs.) We live in Southern California in an apartment community, where our dogs mostly walk on the sidewalk, some grass here and there. It's probably the cleanest place I could imagine walking a dog outdoors. Somehow their paws are routinely SO dirty upon arrival at home. I would encourage anyone to try these wipes out, you might be surprised! My white carpet and sofa (these were pre-dog owner color choices, don't judge me) have held up way better too.

Also - my shih tzu has very sensitive skin, so I was initially worried these might irritate his paws, but I haven't had any problems with it so far."	&&&
Thought I'd give Amazon a whirl on baby wipes since all the Amazon Basics I've tried so far have been good, unfortunately, this isn't one of them. The wipes have "bubbles" on them which make them solid in some areas but easily tear in others. Not good for wiping bottoms cause they tear but okay for toddler face and hand wipes. The texture is very strange as it's uneven and the "fresh sent" is far from fresh. More like a cheap toilet bowl cleaner smell from a public bathroom. If they made the wipe solid like the thicker part of the wipe all the way around it would be a significantly better product.	&&&
WORK VERY WELL	&&&
They are great for cleaning the buns of my kids	&&&
They were dried out when I got them.	&&&
The dispenser sucks. Only can take one at a time then you have to open it back up and push through the next sheet, gets tiring. However, they are big and hands feels clean.	&&&
These really work! Have used them with all three children. Recommend them to everyone!	&&&
It does what it says it does	&&&
I thought Huggies baby wipes does not contain the chemical Methylisothiazolinone anymore. Why is it still on the ingredient listed above? This makes me worried, because I use mainly Huggies diapers and wipes. I don't want my baby to get chemical burns. Listing error or i have to stop using this brand?	&&&
Love these wipes for my daughter. She has NEVER had a diaper rash and she is 6 months. I have tried Equate and Huggies wipes as well. Although they did not cause a rash, they felt harsher on the skin.	&&&
So soft with minimal chemicals :)	&&&
Great wipes, my only complaint is that in the wipe warmer the top wipes tend to get dried out when it is completely full to the top. I know, just put less in there but I like to put a whole pack in there at once, just easier. I like getting the bulk packs that have some flip top packages as well.	&&&
I had these bought for me recently, and I normally only use huggies but I gave them a try and they have no texture to them so when you wipe you have to use multiple of them, and they leave your hands feeling sticky when your done using them. Compared to the huggies natural wipes they dont compare, I would not recommend these wipes.	&&&
I love Huggies wipes and the fact they are natural makes it so much better they are unharmful for your little ones bums!	&&&
Large, strong, efficient. Hands down beats huggies, pampers, and others we've tried. Wish I'd had them 16 yrs ago with baby number one!	&&&
"These are convenient and effective for mild cases of hemorrhoids.

However, there is a problem. Along with other wet wipes, they are advertised as breaking down after being flushed. Unfortunately, tests show they do not. Urban sewage systems are getting clogged with wipes and a rural septic system like mine can be destroyed. So I stopped using them. They need to be discarded with solid trash, not flushed. Which is yucky. So conventional Prep H is a better solution."	&&&
I love the natural care wipes! They are so soft and great for sensitive skin! These are also great to throw in the diaper bag!	&&&
"Great for runny noses which my little one has had plenty of silence starting daycare. Also great for when she wakes up with a dried/crusty nose from overnight drainage. We keep packs stashed all over the house, car, and diaper bag"	&&&
didnt realize this was a case of 6 awesome product im set for the year	&&&
Nice product for your nether region.. no reason to not be clean after doing your business in the bathroom:)	&&&
THESE SCRUBBERS WORK. BUT I USED 6 WIPES FOR MY 10 FINGERNAILS AND I HAD THE WORK DONE. IT DOES REMOVE THE GLITTER EASILY, REGULAR NAIL POLISH REMOVER CAN'T DO THE SAME. THE GLITTER WAS THICK, ON TOP OR REGULAR NAIL POLISH AND MY WHOLE MANICURE WAS DONE USING BUTTER LONDON. I LOVE THIS CHEMICAL FREE BRAND!	&&&
Product works good but I really don't care for the smell.	&&&
I use Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save. I didn't realize how much you really get in this box. This is a perfect buy, as I bought this box two months ago and am not done. I sold the last box to a friend, just because it was a great deal and I knew I was getting more this month.	&&&
love these and buy them all the time the best out of all the ones we've tried they clean glasses and are moist enough to clean all my glasses and sun glasses and my wife all with one wipe	&&&
Wonderful product we use when traveling!	&&&
I like these because they have just the right amount of moisture	&&&
"""These are amazing! My little guy had allergies really bad the other day and while shopping at Toys R Us I found these. I bought them and they were fantastic! Not only do they have a fun smell, so that way my little guy loved using them!



They work much better than a napkin and help so much when they are stuffed up!"""	&&&
i have five kids, theses are the only wipes I buy. They are thick, and soft. Very durable! inexpensive	&&&
"WOW, these things are so soft and comfortable to use! I use them for makeup removing too because they are easy on my skin. I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but knowing now what what do, I would buy these at regular price. They hold up well when wet and soapy, and dry quickly. I fell in love with my norwex cloths and still love them, but as washcloths I love these more!

Because they came individually wrapped with a ribbon I used one to stick in a gift basket for a friend with bath items, I just gave her 1 because I'm selfish like that...wanted them all for myself =)"	&&&
"Absolutely love this product when my daughter has a running nose. I like how it helps her from shafing and how easy the come out of the package."	&&&
I received this product to facilitate my review, all opinions are my own. WaterWipes are the perfect addition to my diaper bag. I have used them with all 5 of my kids, including my newborn daughter who's just 6 weeks old. I also have a 2 year old still in diapers and the WaterWipes work amazingly well for both kids. I think this is because they are both chemical free and are durable and effective enough for the diaper changes of my toddler and newborn. They are wipes I feel good about using because they are free of harsh chemicals and are made of 99.9% Irish water and 0.1% grapefruit seed extract. When I use these wipes, I find that I don't have to use very many to get the job done. I also like that they are more natural, with no bothersome scent added. They also have various other uses, like cleaning hands and faces, that make them versatile. WaterWipes should be in every baby's nursery and diaper bag and are a great gift idea for a new or expectant mom.	&&&
Leaves our stainless steel refrigerator like new. I also like the fresh scent.	&&&
I always need make up remover wipes, so this product is a must for me!	&&&
Love these wipes and the subscription price makes them even better!	&&&
This wipes are super!	&&&
Cleaned my camera lenses perfectly.	&&&
Baby and I Love Huggies wipes and such a GREAT price.	&&&
We purchase these every two months and it seems this last batch is a new formula they are using and it is HORRIBLE!!! They have a horrible scent now that they did not have before. I also notice a little tingling when I use them on my face. VERY disappointed they changed the formula of these wipes. Looking elsewhere to purchase wipes from! *** If you are not happy with this new formula, I STRONGLY encourage you contact Costco, 800-774-8678. Hopefully with enough complaints they will help their customers get back the old formula!!	&&&
These are great. I use them when I just need a quick clean up. Don't have to worry about bottles, they fit in the pocket and are ready to go. Open up and wipe away. Smells great to!	&&&
These are the ONLY brand of wipes that will not "separate" when pulled out of a tub/wipe warmer-- and we have tried many brands!!	&&&
I used boogie wipes when my daughter & son had cold. It really helped. According to me, it's a good product for daily use.	&&&
I've used a lot of different make up wipes. And as a oily skinned gal, I really like a thorough wipe. These wipes are FANTASTIC! I wear full make up which includes black liquid eyeliner. Not a trace of it is left after using a Simple Micellar wipe.	&&&
I've tried many wipe brands and these are my favorite! Not too thin, not scratchy, etc. I like them better than the other Huggies wipes -simply clean. Simply clean felt a little rough. These are perfect though. I don't feel like they will rip a hole in it leaving me with a bigger mess like some other wipes.	&&&
Our baby has very sensitive skin and we love Pampers sensitive wipes. Since she was born, the only brand we have been able to use is Pampers. These wipes are so gentle and such a great value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Seeing that I am extremely heat sensitive, I purchased these to use on the golf course for when I get overheated. What a waste of my money. You get more cooling from baby wipes or make up removal wipes. Don't bother with these. Instead, buy some generic wipes for twice as many wipes at half the price.	&&&
These wipes are great.. I usually use the huggies wipes since they are thicker and I feel the design helps to clean well. These wipes are just as good and excellent for sensitive skin.	&&&
My little one always has diaper rash and I have to be careful of what I use on her bottom. These wipes seem to do well with cleaning but not irritating my little ones bottom. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Have been using these wipes since birth. They are gentle and safe. Have never had problems with these causing any skin irritation or rashes. These are nice thick wipes which are great for big messes and they are generously sized as well. By far our favorite wipe and they seem be gentler and have less chemicals than other leading brands.	&&&
These wipes are my all time favorite. I feel confident knowing that these wipes are free of fragrances, parabens, phthalates, alcohol and dyes when using them on my little ones. They are gentle on even the most sensitive skin. I will continue to purchase these even when my babies are older. They are great for hands and faces to clean up those sticky messes while on the go! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.	&&&
I love the sensitive clean wipes, my 2 year old had really sensitive skin and always has since she was born. These wipes are the only ones strong enough to get her clean and gentle enough not to give her a rash :) Always having good sale prices and coupons too!	&&&
Doesn't smell like I thought it would but it's not bad	&&&
A great place to hide your swag .	&&&
I love these for if my ct has the occasional mess on their fur. Wet enough and strong cloths. I use in conjunction if its a huge mess and cannot use water withVeternaians best dry clean waterless cat bath foam, 4 oz. This is good for tushes, toes, and faces (careful). A full bathing tool? No, but these are my go to to all the rest.	&&&
These are very basic wipes. They aren't very strong or durable. They sometimes rip just pulling them out of the Huggies container and it takes quite a few of them to really clean a messy bottom. Doesn't seem worth paying the Huggies price for these wipes.	&&&
"They do what they are intended to do, except these 'unscented' wipes have a strong foul scent to me. I do not like wiping my baby with these, because it makes me think she just pooped again right after I cleaned her because of the scent.

We bought the Huggies Natural Unscented, and the BabyGancis, which we prefer."	&&&
Just starting the potty training process with my youngest (twin boys) and I couldn't do it without these wipes! They are a MUST!	&&&
Love my huggie wipes over any other brand. The thickness gives me the ability to wipe more in one swipe and its soft and gentle on my baby's little bottom. I've been using it for all my kids.	&&&
I prefer these over the Seventh Generation wipes. Scent is cleaner and less obnoxious than 7th Gen.	&&&
The case is a sturdy built. But getting the wipes out the hole is a headache, they're always getting stuck and torn in the process; round area does not give adequate access to a wide enough surface area to detach one wipe from the others in the case.	&&&
Wonderful quality like all of huggies wipes, I like the light scent that this wipe offers.	&&&
These are ok. I much prefer the Coscto/Kirkland brand wipes. These wipes are great wipes, but just not for me. They are very comparable to Pampers wipes (which I don't care for). If you like Pampers wipes, then these will be great for you.	&&&
Wet Ones are the best. They clean anything and will even take ink out of clothes and off hands. I'm thrilled to have these as part of my monthly Subscribe & Save.	&&&
We have been using these hand wipes for several years and they are the best on the market. Our only complaint about them is the bad taste if you accidentally happen to wipe your lips with one of these wipes. As an aside, we were disappointed that Sam's Club no longer stocks these in their warehouses.	&&&
I just used these for the first time on my expensive Canon "L" lenses. I was looking for a gentle cleaning method that would not damage the glass. These do an incredible cleaning job and dry instantly with no residue. They removed all the smudges and dust I couldn't remove otherwise and dried streak free. The glass is now spotless and ready for another trip into the woods. I can't ask for anything more than that. These will be a permanent addition to my backpack that I keep all my gear in. The price was reasonable for a product that worked so well but then again, Zeiss has one helluva reputation.	&&&
Works very well. The box is big.	&&&
we only use wipes for poopy diapers, and i am so impressed with how much the natural care wipes can soak up. i normally pull three out of the container, to clean up those wonderful newborn explosions, and i typically have to put one back. they are very absorbent and easily wipe up whatever little one produces. i suggest only using for poopy diapers because when we used with every diaper change, we had minor diaper rash develop. once we used tissue paper to dry baby after a wet diaper and only w iped for poopy diapers, the rash went away and we have been very happy!	&&&
Convenient way to clean my cpap mask	&&&
"Flushable, what more can I say.
These should be sold in store for all to buy."	&&&
unless u are replacing the wipes very frequently they will dry up. I took this on a weekend trip and the wipes dried out.	&&&
I love these wipes, I use them for many different things. I wipe my makeup off at night, I wipe the dirt off my son, I use them for diaper changes, and I use them to wipe down surfaces. They have a nice texture and they are very moist. I would recommend these to every mother.	&&&
Product is as described. Cleans my mask vey good.	&&&
"Our daughter still doesn't want you near her nose! Lol not a miracle cure"	&&&
These wipes are nice and thick. Easy to grab and can clean up any mess. Nice smell, I like to have the box on my changing table for easy access. They are great.	&&&
Great product! Very gentle on both my skin and my baby's skin. I would recommend this product to friends and family.	&&&
I order these every month. And never had a problem, my last 3 pack did not have the tear lines. So one giant wipe. What a pain, having to cut what I want each time. School said they would do it so off they went.	&&&
Out of all the wipes out on the market, pampers sensitive wipes are the only ones I can use on my daughter	&&&
"What is it?
A disposable facial cleansing wipes…
Who should use it?
All skin types/conditions (including sensitive)…
What's in it for me?
*convenience
*clean skin without irritating or stripping
*smoother, brighter skin
What's the scoop?
To me, cleansing wipes always seemed like an unnecessary product. A product used only by the less than savvy, perhaps even lazy. I was wrong. As it turns out, people who like to use cleansing wipes are looking for an effective product that doesn't take a lot of time to use. They want a product that they can use anywhere and anytime (even when they're half asleep and don't want to be bothered or worse-woken up by the cold splash of water). I get this.
Its ingredients are simple (in a good way) and to the point. The way it felt was a big surprise. It starts out refreshing and cool and finishes with a clean, non-greasy (but moist) feel. Honestly, I could not tell that I hadn't just washed my face the ""old fashioned"" way. I was clean as a whistle and ready to continue with the rest of my routine.
Any tips?
Yes. Be thorough. This is your chance to get every nook and cranny. Actually, a hidden benefit of this product is how you're much more likely to effectively cleanse often neglected parts of the face and surrounding areas; such as the hairline, around the ears, lip line, neck and décolleté (upper chest) even shoulders and back. Make sure that you use every side and edge of the wipe to get your money's worth. No need to rinse!
Keep in mind; this is the first step of your routine. At the very least, you will want to follow it with a hydrating toner and/or a moisturizer to avoid tightness and dehydration.
Are you still reading?
Inside this cleanser, much to my surprise, I found two new friends and one old time buddy. Hibiscus Flower Extract is added for a bit of exfoliation, Babassu Oil to moisturize and soothe and Sodium Hyaluronate (aka Hyaluronic Acid), one of my all-time favs, used to hydrate. Here's the run down on each.
Hibiscus Flower Extract contains high levels of Pyruvic Acid (referred to by experts as a ""second generation"" alpha hydroxy acid). Pyruvic Acid seems to be better adapted to stimulate cell regeneration without any irritation, acting like salicylic acid (BHA) by dissolving proteins which are responsible for cell adhesions. It has effectively been shown to increase cell turn over in a similar way to lactic acid (AHA) while providing a much deeper hydration (these properties are enhanced by the formula's inclusion of the AHA Citric Acid). In addition, the polyphenols (super-powerful antioxidants) found in Hibiscus Flower Extract stimulate collagen production and cell regeneration. In summary, this marvelous ingredient works with all skin types as it addresses aging, dull skin tone and impurities, provides skin lightening, healing and hydrating benefits.
Babassu Oil has physical characteristics and uses very similar to that of Coconut Oil. Both Babassu oil and coconut oil are great moisturizing options for those with sensitive skin. Unlike coconut oil, Babassu oil doesn't leave you feeling like a grease ball (and importantly is noncomedogenic). It actually leaves a cooling sensation on skin. Babassu oil works especially well to soothe skin irritations like eczema or itchy, inflamed skin.
Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid) is a highly effective humectant (water-binding ingredient) that has the ability to fill the spaces between the connective fibers (collagen and elastin) creating a (superficial) plumping effect. Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid) is used for moisturization and wound healing and is comprised of small molecules that penetrate the skin easily, and can hold up to 1000x their own weight in water. Because the skin naturally loses its water composition as it ages Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid) can replace some of the water lost in the dermis, and potentially fight wrinkles and other signs of aging."	&&&
We use these at the hospital where I do my clinicals...they are great and smell so clean!	&&&
"I don't see how anyone could beat Zeiss. They KNOW about lenses.

For the bathroom mirror, you can probably use a rag or paper towel. For a microscope lens, telescope, binoculars -- or maybe even your eyeglasses -- you need these wipes."	&&&
I love these wipes for everything from baby bottoms to wiping up baby's spilled food. Great for kids and just having in the car for clean ups on the go. The texture and strong structure are unmatched. I've never noticed the smell that many people mention in previous posts & baby's bottom does not react any different. That said, he doesn't have super sensitive skin so he's not likely to react to any new ingredients.	&&&
Now that it's fall in my city, I love wearing dark lipsitcks. My only problem is taking it off by the end of the night because it stains my lips and doesn't fully come off. When I used this, in one swipe it was gone! and left my lips feeling plump and ready for a new lip color! I've laways used waterproof makeup remover or a lip scrub to take of my lippies but since using this, I will never go back! Love love love!	&&&
I bought this for cloth wipes (we cloth diaper). It is perfect! I'm going to buy another one for down stairs and I have the travel one on its way! Oxo makes good quality products. Stylish too!	&&&
Fast and easy way to polish my furniture.	&&&
Easy to use disinfecting wipes with a nice smell! The three-pack helps insure you don't run out unexpectedly!	&&&
I use these on everything and keep a package in my bedside table, desk drawer, grandkids' room and hall cupboard for easy access. They sure make cleaning a lot easier and they work great on every surface I have ever used them on, from tile to wood to glass windows, to electronics, even cell phone screens and eye glasses.	&&&
I use these wipes for my mom - cleaning her hand, giving them to her to clean herself - so much gentler than toilet paper and/or face cloths. Makes her happier and NO laundry! clean clean clean and the sensitive skin wipes are super!	&&&
How do you write a product review about Prep H. My a_ _ was burning and these really helped. You can also pack some in your pockets for emergency fires. Great to sooth the morning after a beer with chips and 'Surprise" salsa evening.	&&&
Worth the money. They use the same wipes at A local children's hospital.	&&&
Boogie Wipes are the best when my little girl has a cold. Regular tissue irritated her sensitive skin. The moist wipes helped sooth her little nose and kept the boogies away! Recommend for every parent!	&&&
Absolutely love these wipes! They are the only ones I will use. Very durable and the scent is wonderful. They are also hypoallergenic so very good for sensitive skin and babies with allergies to perfumes.	&&&
They work great, Best part is the cool label gets peoples attention when you hand the them one.	&&&
These wipes are so soft and smell so fresh. They are perfect for my newborns skin.	&&&
Love these wipes.	&&&
I love these, they are soft and the perfect amount of moisture. They don't stretch to much like other wipes and it smells good!	&&&
"I love disinfecting wipes and use them often. The resident 3-year-old and motorcycle-riding husband seem to provide many opportunities for use.

I have trouble with the Clorox brand's packaging, though. The wipes don't always come out neatly and then I have to wrench the top off the container or stick my fingers through the opening and face the painful consequences from the sharp plastic around the opening. ""Why can't someone figure out a better way to package these things?"" I kept thinking.

Well, someone did. The Lysol disinfecting wipes container has the upper half of the opening to the wipes completely open. The bottom half has a plastic ""star"" which can be used to break off a wipe or two. No jamming up the wipes and endangering my fingers. I can pull off one or several wipes easily and poke around inside the container in case of trouble with dispensing.

Thanks, Lysol!"	&&&
Wouldn't leave the house without it. Being first time parents we had little to no knowledge about what would work best for our infant son. We tried all other brands and came across pampers. My little guy has super sensitive skin and Pampers sensitive wipes were the only wipes that wouldn't break him out into a serious rash. Highly recommend this product!	&&&
We use Huggies wipes for both of our children. I have tried other wipes and I don't like them nearly as much. I like the different varieties that they have to offer. I'll never switch to another brand of wipes.	&&&
These are the preferred individual sanitary wipes for going to restaurants, shows, movie theatres, etc. They are always plenty moist and do a great job of disinfecting.	&&&
I love how soft and delicate the wipes are and there's no weird scent.	&&&
These wipes are the best. They don't contain any alcohol so if baby has a diaper rash they won't hurt as much. Other sensitive wipes are too thin and don't clean very well. After 5 months of baby, these are the only wipes I buy.	&&&
My son had such sensitive skin that other brands of diapers and wipes would give him a horrible diaper rash! But never with Pampers! We made the mistake of using another brand which resulted in a rash. We have switched back to pampers and will stick with them with fail!	&&&
I love the pampers sensitive wipes. The cleaning is done with as little as one wipe and they aren't expensive! These are the only wipes I buy anymore.	&&&
My 3 year old loves these. They are big girl wipes and not baby wipes.	&&&
These work wonderfully & have a GREAT lemon scent! The only con I would say is that they could be a little stronger or have a bit "rougher" scrubbing surface; they start to shred on the tougher stains.	&&&
"I know these Naturally Natures Bamboo Baby Washcloths are meant for babies, but I love to use them for my own sensitive skin.
They are the Softest Washcloths I have Ever felt against my skin and the Generous 91/2"" x 11"" Size makes them perfect for adults!
The edges are well hemmed to prevent fraying.
They washed and dried in my commercial laundry machines without issue and I love that they feel even softer after washing! Didn't think that was even possible when I took them out of the package.
I especially love the presentation that Naturally Nature offers. Each of the Six Baby Washcloths is neatly rolled and tied with a ribbon. The soft Pastel Green (2 ea) and Yellow (2 ea) colors combined with the 2-Off White Cloths are tucked inside a re-usable carry case and would make a Perfect Baby Shower, or Welcome Home New Baby Gift as well as an addition to an Adult's ""Pamper"" Gift Basket!
I received these Naturally Natures Bamboo Baby Washcloths at a discount in exchange for testing and offering my honest and unbiased review.
In All Honesty, I am Highly Recommending them!"	&&&
This wipes are new to me. I thought of giving it a try and I fell in love with it. It has a refreshing scent and its mild for baby. I really recommend this to everyone. Its very hypo allergenic and you won't gonna worry of messy bottom! It's a must have.	&&&
I have extremely sensitive skin with eczema. These are the only facial wipes I've found that are gentle enough for daily use.	&&&
I will keep purchase the wipes!	&&&
These wipes are perfect for newborns. They are soft and don't irritate the skin.	&&&
This wipes are excellent for the day to day cleaning routine!!!	&&&
Love the wipes!	&&&
Not worth the price in my opinion. Basically a glorified tuperware. I bought this to store cloth wipes. It holds enough, but doesn't do a great job releasing just one at a time, which is the entire point of this. Should have saved some money and bought a basic plastic container.	&&&
Best baby wipes I've come across. Perfect for hands, faces, and bums.	&&&
Gentle on baby's skin. Every other wipe we've tried gives my children rashes and these are amazing! Great for sensitive skinned children.	&&&
These are the best wipes ever. Material is strong so it doesn't rip when cleaning child. No strong chemical smells and great for sensitive skin! I'll never go back to Huggies.	&&&
Love these wipes. They smell good and they don't irritate my son's skin.	&&&
We have tried many different brands of wipes and these are our favorite, by far. They are the thickest of any we have tried, don't have any scent which is great and do a job with one wipe that takes other brands 2-3 wipes.	&&&
First time at trying these wipes and I really like them.Price is great and I use them on everything like iPad,iPhone and even reading glasses as well.They work on everything.I will definitely purchase them again.	&&&
These makeup wipes are great! They take off almost all of my makeup and I only need to use one wipe. They have a great smell and are very calming to the skin. I have very dry skin and almost all products bother my face but these don't at all. They don't sting my eyes like a lot of makeup wipes do, which is a big bonus. I do find them a bit overpriced for how many wipes you get per package, especially if you use one or more every day. I also find they sometimes don't remove some eyeliner but besides that I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a good makeup removing wipe.	&&&
From the moment I first opened my sample of AVEENO® ULTRA-CALMING® MAKEUP REMOVING WIPES, I knew I would be happy with this product. The mild smell of the ACTIVE NATURALS® CALMING FEVERFEW® and the feel of the wipe really did give me a calming feeling, which is nice to have at the end of a long day. I was impressed how easily my make up came off - especially because I didn't have to wipe off my eye liner more than once! I am really happy with this product and will make it a part of my daily regime.This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.	&&&
Influenster sent me a pack of Simple Skincare makeup wipes remover. I have never used makeup wipes remover before, yet these do leave my face hydrated and smooth. I have very bad dry skin so these did not irritate my face or dry my face out (which I was afraid of). I love these because they are perfect for removing my makeup after weddings and other bridal events. I can do a lot with just one wipe it pretty much removes all the makeup, which is awesome. Also I love it because It is great for removing eyeliner which we all know these can be a handful to remove from under our eyes.	&&&
My son has always had an issue with wipes and finding the right kind that won't irritate him. My mom had always told me Pampers Sensitive wipes are the best! Once I started using them my son was no longer irritated.	&&&
I prefer these wipes over most others. They smell clean, not a strong, over-powering smell, and clean up A LOT!	&&&
My daughter is sensitive to scented products, but with these wipes she doesn't get that awful rash. They are soft and gentle on her skin, and work well. I keep wipes in several places in my home as well as in my car so I always have these when I need them.	&&&
These seem to work well. They give me a sense of feeling that my sons hands are cleaned well after playing with others/toys. The smell is super light and lemony so a fresh smell that is not overwhelming. He has very sensitive skin that even honest company body wash irritates greatly. However, these wipes did not irritate at all! Will definitely buy again!!	&&&
I got the Huggies Natural Care at my baby shower together with other wipes from other brands a couple of months ago. I would have to say that now that I run out of wipes. I would definetly buy this wipes. They are really soft and thick enough that it makes it easier to wipe my baby. My baby got a bad rash some weeks ago and this wipes were great for her skin. Great product!	&&&
These lens wipes are the best. I have used Bausch & Lomb Sight Savers and found they take too long to dry. The Zeiss wipes clean well and dry quickly and spotlessly.	&&&
The only wipes that doesn't cause my son to get a rash. These are the best! Forever will use these from now on.	&&&
"What can I really say in detail about a product that anyone can use and should use. These wipes provide the ability to make an area feel clean and smell fresh.

The package I received comes with a fairly large amount of wipes - 240 in each container - with a easy way to pull a individual wipe out and use. Also, the wipes came in a box which I am now using as a container, rather than the previous plastic binder, which really served no useful purpose once you pulled one container out.

Overall, I have never been disappointed with this product. I typically use the wipes for the kitchen, bathroom and in the car for cleaning up unexpected spills and dust. Plus, the smell makes me feel like the area has been cleaned."	&&&
I was looking forward to using these wipes as they seemed like they would be a more natural option to pampers or Huggies, however like many of the other reviews on here they caused a red rash the few times I tried them on my son's face. I am also not so sure that they weren't the reason he got his first diaper rash.	&&&
I received a free box of Preparation H medicated wipes for women for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have suffered with hemorrhoids for many years and have tried several products. I don't remember any of the other products working as fast as the Preparation H medicated wipes did. It was like instant relief. I have already bought 2 additional boxes and these will be a staple to have on hand. The packaging is very convenient to keep a few in my purse too!	&&&
Love these wipes! Not too wet or too dry and easy to open and close. Perfect for traveling!	&&&
So satisfied that I purchased The Parent's Choice Quilted Wipes. They are of a generous size, nice and thick, not filmsy. These wipes have a pleasant mild scent and moisturizes the skin, to keep the skin clean, fresh smelling and soft. Would highly recommend.	&&&
These wipes are amazing!! I buy them more often in the bigger packs but we use a small pack to keep in the diaper bag since they fit so much better than a hard container. These wipes clean a lot better than any other kind I have tried also.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting wipes are one of the best wipes out there, it removes all dirt and leaves a nice fresh and clean smell. I you haven't tried it, I suggest you do. I have them everywhere in my house.	&&&
"What is it?
A disposable facial cleansing wipes…
How much?
Who should use it?
All skin types/conditions (including sensitive)…
What's in it for me?
*convenience
* clean skin without irritating or stripping
* smoother, brighter skin
What's the scoop?
To me, cleansing wipes always seemed like an unnecessary product. A product used only by the less than savvy, perhaps even lazy. I was wrong. As it turns out, people who like to use cleansing wipes are looking for an effective product that doesn't take a lot of time to use. They want a product that they can use anywhere and anytime (even when they're half asleep and don't want to be bothered or worse-woken up by the cold splash of water). I get this.
. Its ingredients are simple (in a good way) and to the point. The way it felt was a big surprise. It starts out refreshing and cool and finishes with a clean, non-greasy (but moist) feel. Honestly, I could not tell that I hadn't just washed my face the ""old fashioned"" way. I was clean as a whistle and ready to continue with the rest of my routine.
Any tips?
Yes. Be thorough. This is your chance to get every nook and cranny. Actually, a hidden benefit of this product is how you're much more likely to effectively cleanse often neglected parts of the face and surrounding areas; such as the hairline, around the ears, lip line, neck and décolleté (upper chest) even shoulders and back. Make sure that you use every side and edge of the wipe to get your money's worth. No need to rinse!
Keep in mind; this is the first step of your routine. At the very least, you will want to follow it with a hydrating toner and/or a moisturizer to avoid tightness and dehydration.

Inside this cleanser, much to my surprise, I found two new friends and one old time buddy. Hibiscus Flower Extract is added for a bit of exfoliation, Babassu Oil to moisturize and soothe and Sodium Hyaluronate (aka Hyaluronic Acid), one of my all-time favs, used to hydrate. Here's the run down on each.
Hibiscus Flower Extract contains high levels of Pyruvic Acid (referred to by experts as a ""second generation"" alpha hydroxy acid). Pyruvic Acid seems to be better adapted to stimulate cell regeneration without any irritation, acting like salicylic acid (BHA) by dissolving proteins which are responsible for cell adhesions. It has effectively been shown to increase cell turn over in a similar way to lactic acid (AHA) while providing a much deeper hydration (these properties are enhanced by the formula's inclusion of the AHA Citric Acid). In addition, the polyphenols (super-powerful antioxidants) found in Hibiscus Flower Extract stimulate collagen production and cell regeneration. In summary, this marvelous ingredient works with all skin types as it addresses aging, dull skin tone and impurities, provides skin lightening, healing and hydrating benefits.
Babassu Oil has physical characteristics and uses very similar to that of Coconut Oil. Both Babassu oil and coconut oil are great moisturizing options for those with sensitive skin. Unlike coconut oil, Babassu oil doesn't leave you feeling like a grease ball (and importantly is noncomedogenic). It actually leaves a cooling sensation on skin. Babassu oil works especially well to soothe skin irritations like eczema or itchy, inflamed skin.
Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid) is a highly effective humectant (water-binding ingredient) that has the ability to fill the spaces between the connective fibers (collagen and elastin) creating a (superficial) plumping effect. Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid) is used for moisturization and wound healing and is comprised of small molecules that penetrate the skin easily, and can hold up to 1000x their own weight in water. Because the skin naturally loses its water composition as it ages Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid) can replace some of the water lost in the dermis, and potentially fight wrinkles and other signs of aging."	&&&
These wipes work on those days you are feeling lazy, or need something convenient to clean your face. I like how refreshing it feels after using it on the face and it leaves the face non-sticky like other wipes I have tried previously. Great and the exfoliating factor is a plus. :)	&&&
My daughter has very sensitive skin due to multiple food and environmental allergies. I like that these wipes don't contain anything she's allergic to. My only complaint is that they are kind of flimsy. It sometimes takes several wipes to clean up after a really dirty diaper.	&&&
fit good, work good, the wipes are nice to have, will order again	&&&
The pampers sensitive wipes are amazing! My infant son has super sensitive skin and seems to break out in a rash with just about anything that touches his skin. These are the only wipes out there that not only keep his behind clean and "baby soft". Would recommend these to just about anyone!	&&&
The Lysol Disinfecting Wipes are great! The fresh scents are beyond what I was looking for. The scents are not overbearing as other wipes. They wipe well and don't leave a sticky feeling behind either like other products I have tried. I love the convenient canisters as well. I ordered these just in time and believe this cut down on the germs spread around my home when one my children came home sick. I will be purchasing more of the Lysol Disinfecting Wipes, Variety Pack. Thanks for making a great product."}},	&&&
These are convenient single use lens wipes. A must for us eyeglass wearers. Very handy.	&&&
"Must have for diaper bag!

Pros:
-Easy it open with 1 hand
-Easy to refill
-Keeps wipes moist

Cons:
-Don't know when to refill (A clear container would be helpful)"	&&&
I love love love these wipes! They are cheap and actually work! My babies skin doesn't get irritated because they are fragrance free! They stand up to even the most explosive diaper!	&&&
Great product would tell others to buy.	&&&
This product is non-irritating, great for all skin types. The wipes are convenient when you need to remove makeup on those nights you do not feel like doing a full face regimen. Once done the wipes leaves your face feeling "clean" and I like that it does not make your face feel sticky.	&&&
This is nice and sturdy. My toddler can't get it open as you do have to press the button kind of hard to get it to open. However, I love how this helps pull up on wipe at a time. Much better than the cheapy diaper brand to go containers. This is sturdy and can bear getting thrown around. My only concern is that if you leave the wipes in there too long without using them (about 2 weeks), then they start to dry out. Most people will use the wipes up before this point though. It does hold a decent amount. Enough for a full time diapered baby and a part time diapered toddler to be out of the house for a day I'd say is what it will hold. Would still buy again.	&&&
Cat loves getting wiped with these and his fur seems to be softer. Plus the smell is nice.	&&&
these wipes has been out for a long time because is one of the best cleaning disinfecting wipes there is. You can use them to clean anything from toys, kitchens, bathrooms, and even wall switches to shoes.	&&&
This wipes case is pretty good. It's easy to open with one hand and holds a good amount of wipes. It did randomly break one day (the part that keeps it closed broke, so it wouldn't stay closed anymore). I'm not sure how it happened. I'm going to order another one, though, because it did last six months, which I can't complain about, and for the price it's good quality.	&&&
These wipes are strong enough to get the job done, and super soft for baby! Love these wipes.	&&&
I love these wipes so much! I use them on my son's toys every time he plays with them and make sure all the germs are gone. They also smell good. He hasn't been sick yet so must be working.	&&&
Sam's makes ift very easy to purchase online. The product was ordered and delivered in a very short time. Emails were sent to me letting me know exactily when I could expect my order.	&&&
I purchased this because it said for all skin types and because of the ingredients listed on the packaging (all natural ingredients and supposed to be good for skin). I used them to take off a full face of makeup but they were not effective because I had to use 3 wipes, and even that was not enough to get all the makeup off. After using them, my face was dry, numb, and irritated, and the next morning my acne had worsened. I was so disappointed with these wipes and it was not worth the expensive price... the only pro about them is that they smell nice.	&&&
I recieved this item for free to try and give my honest option I couldn't believe how soft the wipes were to the touch and how gentle they are to the skin, and they had no perfumes so they didn't smell like alcohol like others will definitely be buying this in the future and will recommend to all my friends and family these are a must have	&&&
These are simply the best baby wipes on the market. My daughter was getting diaper rash after diaper rash and nothing was working. As soon as we switched to Seveth Generation we had no more issues. They are very natural and also durable - you don't need a whole bunch to clean up a big mess. I would highly recommend these especially if your baby has sensitve skin	&&&
These have a wonderful light scent and don't burn my sensitive skin at all! They loosed and remove the makeup easily without having to wipe hard, which can cause irritation for me. I absolutely love these and I especially love the clasping lid for these compared to other ones that just have a sticker that eventually becomes unsticky, which leads to your wipes drying out. I love love love these and will be purchasing these from now on!	&&&
Love pampers wipes. They work great and are super soft but strong. Also come at a great price.	&&&
Pamper wipes are the only kind I can use on my kiddo. All the other brands give him diaper rash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Best wipes ever and very moist to the last one! I use them for almost everything and anything. They are especially good for removing make-up.	&&&
"We used the wipes on my daughter face and hands great for a fast wipe down
Love that it Doesn't leave a sticky feeling after !"	&&&
These were a good deal for a 3 pack. I was able to put one in the kitchen and the other two in each of the bathrooms. Love using wipes because they are so convenient. They are great for cleaning up like after your fry something cause it really cuts the grease. Then you just throw them away They have a nice light lemon scent that is not too strong and leaves what ever area you clean fresh and sanitized. I would definitely recommend and purchase again.	&&&
I prefer this unscented pack of wipes to clean my baby's boom.	&&&
I have used Boogie Wipes on my daughter ever since she has been an infant, now 2 1/2 years old, I still use them. They are very soft, gentle and very effective. We are expecting baby #2 and will definitely use Boogie Wipes and Mist on him as well! A necessity in a house with children!! Highly recommend!	&&&
The weave of these wipes makes it so soft and gentle. It's the perfect balance of wet and soft to clean even the dirtiest messes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
When our son was sick these were our go to. We absoulety love them and they smell amazing. A nice clean feeling for the babe. These wipes make cleaning the bogie mess easy and painless. They have saline which helps soothe those little noses.	&&&
99.9% pure Irish water and 0.1% grapefruit seed extract. That's it. That's a complete list of WaterWipes ingredients. If you have ever read any other package of baby wipes (and yes, this includes even those marketed as "natural" or "gentle"), you know that there is a much longer list of ingredients that includes big long words that you can not pronounce or have no idea what they are. If you are concerned about your baby's exposure to chemicals or you have a child with sensitive skin, this is definitely the wipe for you. Of course, even if truly natural, wipes are useless if they do not perform their intended job well. I have used store brand wipes before only to be very disappointed by the fact that the wipes are thin and their texture rough. I had to use double or triple the normal amount of wipes to get the job done. WaterWipes have a nice soft plush texture to them. They are thick enough that you don't have to worry about messes leaking right through onto your hands. There is no need to double stack two wipes together to get enough thickness. Another complaint I have had about other wipes is sometimes they just don't feel sufficiently moist enough. WaterWipes have a perfect moisture level. Some other wipes can also leave a strange feeling, tacky, sticky residue on your hands after you use them. WaterWipes leave no residue behind and also no perfumey odors either. All these great features makes WaterWipes a great choice for jobs beyond diaper changes as well. They work wonderful on dirty little hands and faces. You can wipe off dropped sippy cups or bottles or other items as well. Besides the wipes themselves being great, I find their packaging nice as well. Sometimes wipe packages will end up tearing around the resealable opening area. This will cause your wipes to dry out before the package is gone. I have used several packages of WaterWipes and never had an issue with ripping packages. Another issue with wipes is sometimes the resealable package really doesn't reseal well at all. The restickable cover for the WaterWipes never failed to securely restick. My wipes were always moist down to the very last one. I plan to continue to use WaterWipes. They definitely impressed me, and being that I am currently expecting my 8th child, I have changed a large share of diapers over many years and have tried many baby wipe options. I received this product to facilitate my review, all opinions are my own.	&&&
Will Buy again	&&&
Delivered on time, Works great	&&&
i like there there is no sent, but the wipes are "soggy" almost like a wet paper towel that rips very easily. They are also much more cold than any other wipes I have tried, which my baby isn't fond of.	&&&
When my other brand was not being offered any more for the price I wanted these were sent to me. I found them to be just as good. I have a young family and will continue to use this product until it is no longer necessary.	&&&
It just works great	&&&
I love these wipes, the box got left out in the rain but thankfully the box of wipes was fine!	&&&
These wipes are by far my favorite wipes ever. The natural care really is natural for babies bottoms. They work great for my baby. You should try these you want be disappointed I promise.	&&&
These keep wipes moist incredibly! I accidentally left the bag unzipped in my car overnight and when I noticed I had that moment of dread. I just knew my only wipes were going to be dried out;to my astonishment they were completely wet. I will never use anything else.	&&&
I really like Huggies wipes. They are thick enough that they don't tear on accident but I like that they are easy to tear in half if I'm trying to. A lot of the cheaper/no name wipes are hard to tear in half and I don't always need a whole wipe. I will continue to buy these for my two-year old daughter and will also buy them for my baby that is due in October.	&&&
Love these wipes for my daughter for diaper changes and wiping hands etc. Great price on subscribe and save plus moms club on amazon.	&&&
Sometimes we struggle with going through wipes too quickly, as the wipes are not strong enough to survive some diaper changes. We love these wipes - they leave my daughter clean and fresh, easily taking away anything left on her little bum, and I have noticed fewer diaper rashes since we switched to the Natural Care wipes.	&&&
I am so in love with these bamboo baby washcloths! The packaging is so cute! Each cloth comes rolled up with a piece of polka dot ribbon tied to it! They are so soft, but do a awesome job at leaving your skin feeling so soft and smooth. These are great for babies, toddler.... Well just about anyone, even adults!!!! I love that they come in all different colors and is basically unisex. They make a great gift for baby showers, or just to give to someone who has just had a baby. Each wash cloth is larger than I expected which was great. I have bought wash cloths for my baby and they were so small. They hold up well in both washer and dryer! Overall, I would definitely recommend these cloths!	&&&
They are the real thing and work well.	&&&
Best polish for stainless I have ever used!	&&&
Didn't seem to help at all	&&&
Good price and exactly what I ordered	&&&
These wipes have been very handy for me to use in my stainless steel kitchen.	&&&
Keeps you fresh between shows and does work better than dry toilet tissue especially when you have hemorrhoids.	&&&
I use it for my newborn,the best thing is that she doesn't get an allergic reaction like with the others.keep doing these wonderful wipes because my child and I love them.	&&&
Soft and durable material. Babies love to chew on these. Would recommend these.	&&&
"Fantastic wipe dispenser.

We got one and liked it so much we bought 2 more for other rooms. And I just ordered the adult version for the flushable bathroom wipes as well (it's the same thing but a smaller format as those wipes are smaller sized).

The lid is push to open. One push and it clicks and then a spring lifts it up. You push it again to close. There is a silicone gasket around the whole perimeter of the tub that compresses when the lid is shut, making it completely airtight. Wipes stay super moist in these and don't dry out at all. One of them is kept in a room where it isn't frequently used and I can't detect any difference in the moistness of the wipes.

The real genius here though is the weighted plate. You put the stack of wipes in and then place the heavy plate on top of it. The wipes are pulled through the hole in the plate, making it so that you very rarely get more than one at a time.

Having twins, every little time saving thing helps, and being able to get wipes easily with only one hand is a big help."	&&&
I bought these to put in pre-packed lunches for a class picnic. I keep the extras in my purse, car, and garage. When school starts up, I'll put them in my kids' lunches.	&&&
These are the softest wash cloths, and very durable! Perfect for baby!	&&&
Not expensive and durable. These are a good value and can clean all little bodies and faces	&&&
"So, so soft! These bamboo baby washcloths are some of the softest I have ever felt! Organic and all natural, they are a perfect choice for baby's gently skin! This set includes 6 washcloths in 3 neutral colors. They come in a nice package and each washcloth is tied with a little ribbon. They would make an excellent gift for any new mother, and the colors are suitable for boy or girl. The washcloths laundered with no issues. I am very happy with these for my little ones!

Product provided for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review."	&&&
Love these wipes!!! They clean all areas of my baby's body and they aren't super wet like other brands I have tried. I am definitely sticking to huggies for both diapers and wipes	&&&
they're wipes... not much else I can really say about it.	&&&
Fast shipping. These wipes are great!!! I use them at my dental office.	&&&
I would never have imagined having my @$$hole smelling like like Aloe would make me feel so confident. Also great for those spontaneous 1 on 1 meetings in my office where clean up is absolutely necessary. Great job filling in the blank Dudewipes...#TeamCleanTaint	&&&
Love these wipes, been using them since my son was born.	&&&
Having 4 kids of my own plus working in a kindergarten class room, Clorox wipes have been a Godsend!	&&&
Being a person who battles ocular rosacea on a daily basis, this is the first product that removes the waterproof mascara I was in love with! It's allowed me to start wearing my favorite brands again due to it's ability to effectively remove all the mascara at the end of the day without being harsh or causing flair ups for my eyes! Highly recommend!	&&&
When I ordered this product I though was used with batteries so that it could be used on the go and for the diaper bag. The warmer has to be plugged in to work. It does come with a house and car plug in.	&&&
"warm" as is ~ not ice cold...I have a cold house in the winter so I was looking for actual warm wipes. I could make them more comfortable just by putting the box near the radiatior	&&&
"These are the most amazing wipes! My baby just grew into his BumGenius Freetime diapers & we began using these with them. These are so soft & absorbent. I highly recommend them. We ordered 4 packs, which is plenty so far. We've also been using certain colors solely for spittle, because these are incredibly soft.
I have been using a water & Johnson's bath soap mixture to get the cloth wet for wiping him off as well. So far that method is working wonders & leaves my little boy smelling clean & sweet after each change!"	&&&
Great wipes and great price!	&&&
My favorite wipes. Free of the harmful chemicals and they get my baby very clean! Use on his hands, face and diaper area!	&&&
These are the only wipes that my daughter can use, since she is allergic to everything. They clean very well and I love the ones that come with a plastic pop top for on the go.	&&&
Boogie wipes made colds and wiping snot not so bad. They are so much better than just tissues .	&&&
This product is well worth your money! It is made of thicker material and takes less wipes for those dirty diapers. It's for sensitive skin and there's no doubt in my mind that these work and I have consistently used these for the last four years! If your going to buy wipes don't question it go for it, because you won't be disappointed!	&&&
"Functioning as wipes, they work as well as you want them, too. The quality is great. They don't result in rashes. Just as good as any other wipe on the market, so it seems silly to pay more for a name brand when these are perfectly sufficient.

My only complaint is that they tend to stick together on the way out of the package, so I'll often end up with a handful of 4 wipes. I gotta do this one-handed, you know. I'm holding baby legs with the other hand.

That doesn't warrant paying more for a name brand though, so I don't regret going this route at all."	&&&
These little gems are amazing! They take off all of my makeup (down to waterproof everything) with no rubbing or scrubbing! I am super impressed with these! And they don't irritate my skin like some other wipes!**This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.**	&&&
"I bought these to keep in my rolling luggage for business travel. I wanted a way to freshen up after running through an airport to catch a flight since the bathrooms in airports are often crowded or lacking in paper towels.

On portability, these are a 10/10 since I can stow half a dozen of them in my luggage and not notice the weight.

They are moist enough and soft enough that you can pretty much wipe down your face/neck and hands and it won't go dry. I did notice, however, that they can leave behind lint if you rub them across a stubbly beard.

The scent is a bit too medicinal, but at least it smells clean. I figure most people around you would rather deal with some temporary menthol/witch hazel smells than to have you sweaty and stinky.

The only thing I did notice was that heat does degrade them somewhat. Some of the wipes that had been sitting in my luggage after a few months had turned brown. Performance was OK, but they just looked different, probably from heat while my luggage was stored in the trunk of a car on a hot day."	&&&
Good price. Nice and thick, gets the job done better than the thin wipes.	&&&
Nice large size, pre-moistened, and comes with a self-sealing container. Especially good for those whho are allergic to perfumes!	&&&
Great for wedding "survival" kits.	&&&
Works really good, worth the money spent.	&&&
They are exactly what they say they are. Better than other brands I tried. Can be used for various items: glasses, tablets, screens	&&&
These are my faves. Soft, strong, and they get everything on the first swipe. Toddler doesn't stay still long enough for a second go!	&&&
Works great!	&&&
A must in my household for our allergies...	&&&
I really like these wipes. If you see my photo, you will see that it is bigger and thicker than the Lysol wipe on the top, so it doesn't tear easily. I can clean my mirror, counter, sinks, and wipe around my toilet with one wipe. I don't see any streaks on my mirror like some of these other reviews complain about. I included a photo of my shiny clean bathroom just to show. I even took the photo from an angle under the light so you would be able to see if there were any streaks. They leave a tiny amount of lint/fibers on the mirror or glass, but it's nothing I can't just blow off with my mouth after it dries, which is fairly quickly. It's far less than what you would see using windex and a paper towel or cloth. So, I'll give them four stars instead of five, but there's no perfect product out there. I have had these for about a month, and I haven't noticed them losing their integrity. The package is resealable, so they stay moist, and they're a huge space saver under my bathroom cabinets.	&&&
LOVE THE WIPES, SO SOFT AND MOIST! CLEANS VERY WELL HITTING EVERY LITTLE SPOT.	&&&
These wipes are strong and take the cake! Doesnt take many to get the job done!	&&&
I use these for everything! They are great to keep in the glove box, purse, craft room, nursery and book bags! The scent is pleasant and they are very moist and 1 goes a long way! Perfect for people with children or who do things that make a mess. Also amazing for cleaning off Cricut Cutter mats!	&&&
They came moist and they clean well.	&&&
I do love these wipes! The are good for my sensitive skin but they are completely reliable for removing all makeup. Follow with cleanser.	&&&
I have used Huggies wipes for all of my kids. First for my 2 boys, now with my daughter. I love them because they are thicker than other brands and you don't have to worry if they are going to let the mess break through to your hand instead of staying contained in the wipe.	&&&
I like buying by the cases. Most of the time our local store is out of the kind that I like. Thank you	&&&
Well meaning but the sheets are too small and too delicate.	&&&
"I am always looking for something to clean my clubs. I carry several different towels and they work alright except if you need something wet. I ran across these Golf wipes that were in a sealed pack with moist little towels. I ordered this package of 18 pre-moistened clothes to help me keep my golf clubs clean. The package says that it would clean stubborn stain and dirt from golf balls and club face.

I put these little towels to good use as soon as they arrived I found a heavy plastic tab in front that lifts up and yu can pull out a moist towel. I tried wiping it on my clube and it worked great so continued to the grips as they were showing grime on my new red grips. These towels worked just great had to rub the grips down but they came clean and one towel finished the job. It was worn down but still moist enough to make them look brand new.

These plastic enclosed towels are nice to keep on my golf cart so they are handy whenever I need them. On rainy days where mud can accumulate on your clubs I have a moist towel ready to wipe them down. One can find mud or water most any where is a water line brake it leave mud to stick on your clubs. This re-usable pouch is handy to keep in your golf back or golf cart for a quick clean up of your balls and clubs.

The package says the ingredients are Aqua water, Isporopyl Alcohol, Ammoniam /sodium Sulfate and Sandalwood Frangrance. Check out their web site at www.lagilasports.com for place to order one package of 18 wipes are $6.96 or package of 3 for $19.95. I will keep mine with me in my golf cart a must have item in your golf bag or cart."	&&&
I can't be without these things. They save me from myself by cleaning up my oops! moments. They work well in a pinch when I'm traveling or just out for a meal. I always keep a few in my office and another one or two in my purse. If you have them around for a year or more and they dry out in the packaging, they can be revived with a little water and they still work to remove stains.	&&&
Easy to use wipes but expensive product. It is not available in most stores.	&&&
I am in love with these Wipe & Go's. I am handicap and always end up with food on the front of me. But this wonderful product cleans it up and not even any shadows of the spill. I keep them in my purse, car, and my go-go scooter carry pack. But now, I cannot find them in my local grocery stores, so I came on line to hopefully find them. I've shared them with friends and they cannot find them either. I won't give up until I find them.	&&&
We've been buying Costco wipes for 3 years, but the new smell is not good. If they don't change back we will have to change brands.	&&&
"I like these types of makeup removing towels for the ease of use. I have bought a different brand in the past & they smelled so bad I wasn't able to use them.
These don't smell bad (they actually smell very good) the smell they have is not strong at all. They are large enough to remove a full face of makeup. My skin is extra sensitive & I had no problems at all using these daily. I would buy them again."	&&&
I love these wipes, they are convenient have a great scent, and handy when needing to clean something quickly. I use them for everything, in the bathroom, kitchen, everywhere in my home.	&&&
Excellent value for good wipes. No complaints here!	&&&
Quick fix for when you're feeling "not so fresh."	&&&
We love these wipes. They stand up well to even the toughest messes. They clean well and leave our little ones' bottoms clean and refreshed.	&&&
not as expected. Unlike the name brand product which feels smooth and cooling, these have a chemical feel/burn to them.	&&&
Good and easy to use. It would be nice if they have more wipes in it.	&&&
Item delivered on time, was as described. An excellent way to gently clean off your face and noggin anytime. Just open, wipe and REFRESH. Its that easy!	&&&
love everything about these wipes!	&&&
We purchased these for my grandmother who is in her 80's and has skin cancer. She raves about them - says they're exactly what she was looking for. They're very, very soft and are a great buy for more than just babies.	&&&
Not sure it it is removing the heavy metals but I hope it is. Smell good.	&&&
My baby gets rash when I use these:/	&&&
I got this set for my sisters baby shower and she kept going on about how soft they were. My wife is going to order a set for her self to clean her tablet and phone. Thanks!	&&&
I love this product, wipes come out of the dispenser easily and don't often get stuck.	&&&
Cleans really good. Glad to pick this for traveling. Smells great compare to others.	&&&
I don't know what I ever did before clorox wipes were created. These wipes come in handy for almost every situation and make cleaning less of an annoyance. The price is great and I have these shipped to me through my subscribe and save.	&&&
Love these! Not only for their intended purpose, but on those days I don't have time to shower (I call them boohoo showers), or I have a doctor appointment in the middle of the day. I use them under my arms and elsewhere. They're thick, large, and a really nice quality. Smell is also fresh and not overpowering. I've tried others while camping for days in the middle of nowhere and they haven't compared to the quality and freshness of hoohoo. And while it can be tough to justify paying for something that's disposable (like my compost bags, or the doggie poo bags I have to now purchase), it's a small price when you can't shower and want to feel clean/refreshed. This isn't something you use everyday, but I put them in every purse and pocket, and I reach for them more often than I thought I would. They're definitely something I'll always have handy.	&&&
Perfect for toner! Barely absorbant, so most of your expensive product goes onto your face instead of getting soaked up by the gauze like you would see with regular cotton rounds. And there's no dripping!	&&&
Love these handy little wipes!	&&&
"My wife and I have used these as our primary wipes since our twin boys were born. We like that they avoid a lot of the chemicals in other wipes. They work well at getting their dirty business done and we are happy at his they perform their basic function.

They do tend to come out ""together"" a bit more than we would like, but you get used to it and learn how to pull them one at a time. We try as often as possible to use less harsh products around our babies and these seem to fit the cause. Earths Best is one of our preferred brands."	&&&
Great for potty trained toddlers! They're flushable and smell good :)	&&&
A coworker recommended these to me years ago, and I've used them in two notable situations. The first was cleaning the light tan interior of my purse, after my leftover Junior Mints from the movie theater spilled out and were smashed against all sides of my purse. The second was cleaning the white fabric surrounding the zipper on another purse that was splashed with a red drink. I am staring at in right now in amazement after cleaning it 4 days after the stain occurred. In both scenarios the stains completely disappeared and my purses look as good as new. I'm blown away by how well they work. I buy them whenever I see them, as I assume one can never have too many of these gems! So yes, I am hoarding Shout wipes.	&&&
wipes are durable & do not fall apart no matter how much I wipe	&&&
Needs to be lighter weight and thinner. One touch button gets stuck sometimes.	&&&
Love the fresh scent, not to overpowering. Perfect for keeping in the car also for wiping hands when getting in from playing at the park.	&&&
I've been trying to take better care of my skin. I'm guilty of not washing my face every night in the past due to being just too tired. I got a good deal of these and use them pretty much every day to wipe off the day's dirt. They're wonderful! Looking forward to trying more of their products!	&&&
I received this product to facilitate my review, all opinions are my own. I loved using WaterWipes on my baby. I have tried the Honest brand wipes before these, but the WaterWipes brand felt better. I have read a lot of reviews about the packaging. I had a similar problem most mothers had with the wipes being very difficult to take out because they don't come together. I was about ready to give up on these wipes because I don't have time to pick at these wipes or pull out at upwards of 5 wipes at once if I need them quick. The answer was WaterWipes. WaterWipes are by far the world's purest baby wipes, and are suitable from birth thanks to their amazing 99.9% water composition. The other 0.1% is a droplet of grapefruit seed extract. No other chemicals or ingredients whatsoever. WaterWipes are unlike any other baby wipe on the market, and have been produced to give unrivalled mildness, purity and safety. Conventional chemicals-based baby wipes use ingredients also found in bubble baths, shampoos, etc - but those products aren't used on a baby's skin 10+ times every day! There isn't a skincare product that you'd use on your own adult skin 70-100 times every week, so why would you do this to a small baby's delicate skin if you didn't have to?! WaterWipes are the baby wipe that parents and healthcare professionals have been waiting for. They have no smell, they leave no residue on my baby's sensitive skin and I wish every parent out there stopped using chemicals on their poor babies. I especially use these when we travel as they are super convenient. I highly recommend this product for use on babies.	&&&
These Bamboo Baby Washcloths were so soft. They lather up quickly and easily and are a great size. Lovely colors	&&&
"These are great baby wipes, and are not just for babies. As an IBS sufferer, I LOVE these baby wipes

What I love about them:
Simple ingredients - these wipes contain two ingredients: purified water and grape seed extract. I don't have to worry about chemicals with these wipes

Can be used by females - these wipes can be used by females to help them freshen up their private areas, in fact, my gynecologist recommends these wipes for feminine hygiene

Thick - these wipes are thick and one wipe lasts a really long time when you have a big job to do

Stay moist a really long time - these wipes stay moist a long time, and there is more moisture in them then regular baby wipes

Large wipes - these wipes are a great size, measuring a little over 7"" in size

Great for people with allergies - perfect for people with allergies like myself, as there is nothing to react to in these wipes

Great for sensitive skin - I have extremely sensitive skin and these wipes do not break me out of leave any kind of rash. These wipes are much milder than the sensitive skin wipes that so many brands like Pampers and Huggies offer

What I don't like about them:
Not flushable - the only downside is they are not flushable, if they were, they would be the absolute perfect wipe on the planet

Can't find them in stores - cannot find them in stores in my local area

Expensive - compared to other wipes, these are more expensive

Less wipes per pack - each pack of these wipes contains far fewer wipes then other packages with only 60 wipes in each package which costs the same price or more than a regular pack of wipes

Don't pop up - these wipes don't pop up like other brands, you have to physically pull the next wipe out manually from the package. I wish they would make these wipes so they pop up

Don't fit all portable wipe dispensers - these wipes are slightly larger than regular baby wipes. They do not fit all of the portable (purse sized) baby wipe dispensers and it's difficult to find a dispenser for travel purposes. I end up just folding some wipes in half and putting them in a Ziploc bag

Mold in the heat - if you leave these wipes in a hot car, or any other very hot place for an extended period of time, they grow mold on them. You should never leave them exposed to the heat if you don't want mold growth

Don't fit all wipes holders - these wipes don't fit all wipes holders made for home use. I found that they fit the Oxo brand perfectly however

At the end of the day, I love these wipes, and will continue to use them as an alternative to so called sensitive skin baby wipes"	&&&
"Every time my daughter gets a cold I have Boogie Wipes on hand. They are soft and soothing on her skin and do a great job of getting mucous off of her skin and nose. When there is build up or dried snot on her nose I don't have to fight her with dry tissues trying to peel it off. The boogie wipes do an amazing job of cleaning all of that up. My favorite is the unscented, but recently purchased fresh scent. It is very lightly scented and I am happy about that."	&&&
Great wipes for my toddler's sensitive behind. Huggies would break him out on a really bad rash so I'm glad I switched to these.	&&&
Why do sanitary wipes need to have a gender designation?	&&&
Great wipes work really well, will definitely buy again.	&&&
"These wipes are a must have for any mom on the go....I have them in my house, in my car, in my purse, and they smell great! My daughter loves the smell too, she tries to eat the wipes and loves the grape smell!"	&&&
"this wipe warmer is great. never dries out! the bottom pad did get brown once, but i washed it and it was good as new. all my friends have diferent warmers and their all dry out. great product."	&&&
I have a Samoyed make adult dog who loves his daily eye wipes as it reduces tears and is definitely an aid to his daily grooming practices.	&&&
"Great value as a pack of three, lots of wipes in a single canister. However, the thing that separates a wipe when you pull one out of the canister is very, very finicky. Also, I find that the wipes leave quite a bit of lint, as well as streaks depending on the surface you are using it on, despite parts of the labeling stating that it is streak-free. Also doesn't pick up things like dust, dirt et cetera.

Otherwise, they are nice wipes that probably kill germs properly. I have no scientific equipment to judge that."	&&&
I rescue cats and kittens, and I now keep a container of these in every room. They are invaluable for keeping everything wiped lean and smelling good, and the one-at-a time dispenser makes them easy to use.	&&&
Only wipes I will buy. They are so soft and thick. Love them.	&&&
Excellent wipes for sensitive skin!! These clean really well and haven't had any issues yet with rash, etc.	&&&
Pampers sensitive are my favorite wipes, hands down. Soft and stretchy and no yucky scents (I like my baby to smell like a baby, not perfumed baby things, thank you.) None of my sensitive skinned babies have ever gotten a rash from these, unlike the comparable brand's "sensitive" lines.	&&&
I love these wipes, I need to order more in the future!	&&&
Best buy by far'	&&&
Pampers sensitive wipes are the only wipes that I will use on my twins. They are soft, gentle, large enough for those big poops and are simply the best! I was first introduced to this brand of wipes in the hospital and I understand why this is the wipe chosen especially after using some of those other brands people put in my "wishing well" at my baby shower. I always have some wipes in my bag and they are gentle enough to use to wipe their face, hands, and nose. I can see myself carrying these wipes even after they are no longer in diapers! Great product.	&&&
Got these the other day. They are HUGE and do everything as advertised. Twice the size of the baby wipes you can purchase. Smell great, leaves you soft and smooth and feeling clean. They are everything as advertised and more. Great, Great product.	&&&
My daughter has had sensitive skin since she was born. A family member suggested Boogie Wipes, we tried it, and we are hooked! Boogie Wipes leaves her nose & face clean without irritation. It comes in a conveniently sized container that can be easily added into any diaper bag or purse. I won't leave home without it!	&&&
Nice thick wipes, great for sensitive skin. Only downside is they dry out very quickly.	&&&
Can't believe how well these clean my stainless fridge, washer, and dryer. One does all 3??!	&&&
I will never buy Huggies again! The wipes feel very hard and gave my child a rash. Even when I pull the wipes out, they tear easily!	&&&
Very lovely& beautiful.	&&&
We have been using these for our daughters for the past couple of years and they seem to make all of the difference in the world over tissues. When children have colds they wipe their nose hard and tissues can really tear them up. Just a few weeks ago my 1 year old was getting 5 teeth in at once that made her nose run all of the time! Her nose was rubbed raw by the repeated use of industrial brand tissues so we purchased a bunch of these boogie wipes. We had them at home, in the cars, at school, everywhere! Even though her nose was still running we were able to get the irritation on her nose to subside and she was willing to let us wipe her nose once again. If you find that you are coming down with a cold this fall you might even want to use these as well!	&&&
Love these wipes. Even when my daughter had a terrible diaper rash, they were gentle on her skin.	&&&
After using Huggies Natural Care for quite some time, I tried another well known brand of baby wipes because they were on sale. Big mistake. Huggies wipes are much more substantial in size weight and overall stronger. Huggies are easier to get out of the container without shredding, tearing or removing multiple wipes at a time. Sticking with huggies from now on.	&&&
I like pampers wipes because they are soft and smell good, but feel they don't have enough grip to clean up my tiny ones Big diapers messes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I love these wipes. They are soft, sensitive, and smell good. My child did not break out as with other wipes. I would recommend these to other parents when choosing wipes.	&&&
First of all- These smell amazing and are super soft! I have really sensitive skin and these wipes were gentle, yet effective! My skin did not get red or irritated at all. I felt fresh, soft and smooth! The lavender scent is great!! This post was sponsored by AVEENO® as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review	&&&
We always use the 7th generation wipes. They work great and clean wonderfully. No smell or additives. Love these wipes and recommended for the twins!	&&&
These wipes are great and priced much better than store brands. The best part is that its delivered to my home.	&&&
IT IS WHAT IT IS	&&&
No funky scent, texture or side effects. I'll keep on buying these and buy them for friends!	&&&
flawless clorox wipes	&&&
"I've been using the flat packs of glass wipes by a well known competitor to Clorox, so really wanted to see if these were better, worse, or the same.

They actually out-preformed the more popular glass cleaning brand in terms of lint and streaking. On the other hand, these were not as saturated with the cleaner, so they dried out quicker. That means these are perfect for a quick bathroom wipe up, not for a set of three sliding glass doors.

In my opinion, the fact that they are drier might be part of the reason why they leave less streaks. What liquid IS left behind evaporates in seconds, and does so invisibly.

While not 100% lint free, they are better than my current brand. Better than most paper towels.

On the down side...do we really need MORE plastics that are recycled only a small percent of the time? C'mon, Clorox."	&&&
Since his birth at the hospital, we have been using Pampers sensitive wipes on my son. They have been nothing short of excellent. They have been so soothing, and being used in our wipes warmer makes them that much better! I love that they come in refill packs which makes my job just a little bit easier.	&&&
Great for diaper changes and general kid cleaning. I like that they have less bad ingredients than others. They still have a lot of soap or other cleaner as it easily scrubs the mess from highchair trays and toys. They hold up well but my babies can still tear them up if they get their hands on them. No skin reactions.	&&&
Very convenient, good price, love them.	&&&
Great at removing transdermal patches! Slight chemical smell but not too bad. Made changing patches so much easier and my skin is in much less irritated.	&&&
Worked great. Before I started to use it I would try to peel the adhesive off it would pull my skin off. Very pleased	&&&
Just as described it was soft and worked well for my child.	&&&
Works well for what we do.	&&&
These smell great and clean dirty hands very well with one wipe. And if they are really 99% effective at killing germs then they are perfect to have in the car, purse, whenever traveling out & about !	&&&
My son has sensitive skin and this is great! DOesn't hurt his bum!	&&&
They're okay wipes, decent durability, when used to wipe a surface leaves behind a very soapy residue (doesn't happen on child). And don't like how they come packaged, it may be resourceful, but I feel like the left overs are going to dry up. Will be sticking to parents choice at Walmart from now on.	&&&
Love these wipes. Perfect for a little one with sensitive skin. Plus they clean up all messes they make!	&&&
Once you use these wipes you will be hooked. I use them before I go to bed. My face feels clean and hydrated. LOVE!	&&&
Leaves streaks and doesn't deter ants like Clorox does. Won't re-order.	&&&
These wipes have the perfect amount of moisture and softness where they are not too soggy or slimy. They have little bumps that help wipe away extra "stuff" so I rarely have to use more than 2. I'm very happy with this product and hope they expand the line to more products (diapers, toilet paper, paper towels, etc)	&&&
These wipes are perfect in my case. I am chemically sensitive to fragrance of any kind and use your fragrance free products regularly. I was rather anxious to try these but so glad I did, I've had no reaction while using these wipes and I love the refreshing smell.	&&&
I purchased these wipes to make my own baby wipes as other brands (including natural) contain harmful ingredients that I do not wish to use on my baby. The cloths are unbleached and can be reused over and over again (just throw in the laundry with the cloth diapers). The only thing I would change is that I would prefer them to be a little thicker. They won't last as long as other reusable wipes I've seem.	&&&
Terrible, used to be thicker and spongy, now extremely thin that unfold into even thiner double size and dry out withoin seconds.	&&&
They are very soft just as advertised. They come as a nice gift set and the colors are pretty. So far so good!	&&&
We typically use Huggies and will go back. We were really hopeful for the Amazon brand, but they seem like a Pampers rip off and we hate those too. If 2.5 stars were an option, this would be my rating. My toddler is pretty close to being fully potty trained so I've used a lot of wipes. Here are the pros: (1) the price is good, (2) the ingredients are fully listed and are good for the most part, (3) it's strong, and (4) they truly are good for sensitive skin. Cons: (1) They are not moist enough. It takes twice as many of these to clean up a poop. (2) The synthetic material is not very absorbent and if you fold it in half, it slides against itself. I've gotten a lot of poop on my hands as a result of this. (3) It's only textured on one side. The texture pattern is too big so it really does not do anything. (4) The pop out design is poor. If you pull on it, like 10 of them come out. Overall, the biggest flaw is the weird, almost hydrophobic, material that it's made out of and the poor texture. It takes twice as many wipes to get the job done and they create many more messes.	&&&
I bought this wipe warmer because I read it worked with cloth wipes. I have been using it about 2 months now and it does a great job keeping my cloth wipes warm and moist. They stay fresh in the wipe solution I make. The pillow tends to brown a little, I think when the warmer was empty, but overall a great product and really helpful when cloth diapering.	&&&
I use these everywhere. Even keep one container in my car. They are lightly scented with lemon and work well on almost any surface.	&&&
Unfortunatly I am living in Mexico City. The towels were deliver by a NY friend and the towels arrived almost dry.	&&&
I love their always bringing me the wipes on time. Good price and quality.	&&&
Partially works but leaves a residual on your hands	&&&
Don't tear off easy so get multiple wipes at once. Also, very slippery cloth texture that didn't wipe as well as Huggies wipes do.	&&&
"Ordered these wipes for my granddaughter. Good size containers, like that they are fragrance free, less irritating.
I will be ordering these again. Highly recommend."	&&&
"Ok...I was extremely frustrated after taking a shower getting into my car and sitting in air conditioning, all in all approx 2hrs....if u want to skip all the back story about to start skip ahead to ""--->""......,
Okay so finishing where I left off I was sitting in an air conditioned office when I got a whiff of b.o. I thought 'naw that can't be from me I haven't exerted myself at all today and I've been in the AC & I JUST SHOWERED!!' but alas I snuck a whiff & sure enough, to my astonishment it WAS me:( I have in my bathroom right at this very moment 5 antiperspirants & I've had enuff of them not working so great, so I went straight to sephora & purchased these wipes....I came home opened the pack right away used the wipe and started getting ready for my night out, unfortunately no time to shower:(
as I neared my destination I thought ""darn, I forgot to layer another fragrant antiperspirant on, but what am I gonna do I'm here already"" so my social life was literally in DERMAdr's hands!!
---> I kid u not after a being out for 6+ he's and walking and being in a bar-- NO SMELL!! I was amazed, mind blown and so glad. I was completely dry, I also should mention I used it under my chest where I can sweat a lot with little activity, boob swear not cute and I had none!!! Try these please- u will not be disappointed and will not have to deal with sweaty embarrassments- I stash one in my purse as a just in case my regular doesn't cut it. Yes they are expensive but I try and use them as smart as possible."	&&&
cleans even the hardest to remove mascara and leaves my skin soft, not dry.	&&&
I love these wipes! They are not soaking wet but thick, soft and damp for my son's sensitive skin.	&&&
Quality product. Love the feeling afterward. Will buy again and again! Affordable.	&&&
I love these glass wipes. They are easy to use and you don't need to use anything else with them when you clean and wipe a surface. You can use them in your house and in your car. You can also use them on your windows in your house and in your car. Clorox is a well trusted and well established name in cleaning supplies. These germ buster wipes live up to the Clorox brand name.	&&&
I recently went to China and decided to take a dozen of Simple with me. Smart move on my part, made my travels so much easier, it was a very busy trip, no time to clean up but having Simple gave me the time to feel clean.	&&&
These wipes work well on both desktop and laptop monitors but unfortunately, the packaging has a lot to be desired, specifically, the way the container distributes the wipes. I would prefer if the wipes were simply laid down instead of wrapped in a roll. It is more difficult to remove the wipes and trying to set it up to go through the distribution hole in the container gets some doing. Also, I had a couple of incidences where maybe one or two of the wipes were wetter than others so it may leave a streak. If it were not for the container, I would rate it 4 stars. Still works but the price is what sold me on it.	&&&
I love my sh-mop, but the sh-whipes had long ago worn out. I am happy to have replacements so I can sh-mop away again.	&&&
Most helpful product out there for removing makeup without irritating my skin.	&&&
"We've been trying these for the first time as part of the ""Amazon mom"" subscriber package (even though I'm the wrong gender for the mom label).

We really like that Amazon focussed on keeping away from harsh chemicals, are focussed on sensitive skin, and that these are even safe for hands and such. They are both soft and sturdy.

The product certainly works well from my perspective. With twin boys, we get more than our share of chances to test these on some of the messiest situations and they work well.

We've mostly used Earth's Best and Seventh Generation in the past. Our current intent is to stick with these. They really seem to have been developed with customers like us in mind."	&&&
These are awesome. They are so soft, and delicate, perfect for my grand babies.	&&&
Countless friends advised us not to condition our baby to expect warm wipes because it would make outings and traveling challenging. Since we chose not to purchase a wipe warmer we purchased this to hold wipes. It's amazing! I wish I'd purchased one of these for every bathroom in the house years ago. The weight is genius. I do wish it came in solid white, solid black, and other more decorative options such as silver or gold.	&&&
Too thin and not enough moisture. I eventually switched back to another type of huggies wipes.	&&&
"will recomment for all families to give a try.
Good for the money."	&&&
Nice and thick, scent free, however they do have a tendency to shred easily.	&&&
These repel wipes are always nice to have onnyou, here in florida. Day, night, it doesnt matter they will bite you. I keep the wipes in my backpack and in my glovebox. Id say if I use these I will only have a handful of bites rather than being eaten alive.	&&&
These wipes are sturdy but VERY rough on my baby's bottom. Good for cleaning but not gentle for baby's delicate skin.	&&&
I love to use these for myself as they are moistened and soft.	&&&
I used these all over the house. I liked the scrubbing side for bathroom soap scum or in the kitchen for baked on messes left on the stovetop.	&&&
What's not love about huggies wipes they don't tear and they are so soft and get the job done .	&&&
i have used these wipes and they work great. overall they are very good wipes I just don't like the scent of the wipes. they seem to have a different scent than I thought they would. but its nothing that would keep me from buying them again and again.	&&&
Worth the value, durable, sent-free. What more can you ask for	&&&
These wipes are the softest ive ever used for my daughter and worked greaaat. I would recommend everyone get these.	&&&
"I have struggled with hemorrhoids after giving birth to my three daughters. With my first two daughters the pain was so bad I would cry every time I needed to make a BM. I was giving a sample of Preparation H Medicated Wipes and it made such a big difference for me. I started using them 2 months after having my baby and after only a week my flare ups were extremely rare. I am now 5 months post baby and feel completely healed. Give it a try!
*I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."	&&&
I like this product its Nice and soft, great for on the go and Good for sensitive skin.	&&&
"I purchased these wipes to take on vacation with me. I love them! They take off my makeup. It takes a bit to take off my mascara, but I found that if I just put the wipe over my eyes and rest it there, it's much easier. My skin is left feeling like I could go without moisturizer.
Also, THANK YOU for donating to a great cause and making a biodegradable product!!! I'll buy again and again!"	&&&
These Preparation H Medicated wipes for women are great! I received a free sample from Smiley 360. I love that each are wrapped individually so they are easy to carry in your purse. They work fast and effectively. They stop the itching and the pain. Wonderful product!	&&&
These are the softest wipes I've found. They are almost lotion-y. This size is great for a diaper bag or on the go.	&&&
"I really appreciate pre-treated wipes for quick cleanups of counters, bathrooms, table tops, you name it. I had been using the BERKLEY & JENSEN brand, but while cruising Amazon a some months back, I saw these GREENWORKS and decided to give them a try.

The compostable, naturally derived cleaning solution claim is what mainly sold me (I am a long-time fan of cleaners like SIMPLE GREEN), but I was also hoping for something less ""wet"" than the BJ's brand (they can be quite sopping at times). I have now used up the very last of this 3 pack this past weekend, and generally speaking, I do like them. They did the job admirably whether I was wiping down the toilet bowl or a quick clean of the stainless steel table I use as a prep-station, and indeed are less drippy than the BJ's set.

Just one major issue, one big enough to be a hassle each and every time I wanted a cloth- the grippy dispenser outlet is TOO grippy. I had to tug, pull, and push the grip panels DOWN with my other hand to get a single cloth out- each and every time, for each and every cloth... that's 90 times I had to do the same thing with that infuriating grip dispenser. Frankly a really bad design job, enough to make me never buy these again. If the grip panels were removable, I'd be far, far happier with GREENWORKS.

Great wipes, junk setup. I just bought another 3-pack of the BERKLEY & JENSENS 75 count. At least its half-hearted dispenser setup is easy to deal with."	&&&
This did absolutely nothing for my feet. I have used antiperspirant wipes many times in the past with no reaction but I broke out in a very itchy rash with this product. I was sweating hours later, while with other products I have gone for days without sweating.	&&&
Exactly what I was looking for	&&&
These are so wonderful.	&&&
I was very excited to try this product, but unfortunately when I opened the containers I found mold growing on dried-out wipes. I wanted to return them, but unfortunately did not get around to it within the 30-day timeframe. I am hesitant to buy any more of these products online.	&&&
I love these baby washcloths. I actually purchased them for myself. I wanted a cloth that was soft enough to use on my face. These are perfect. These would be a great gift.	&&&
I am giving 3 stars because of the size. They are good product but the package is too (too) large. Not really practical if you are on the go and planning to add this to your diaper bag supplies	&&&
The texture was different on these. I normal order the Huggies Simply Clean 648 pack and have always been happy. These seem rougher and drier. Not happy at all.	&&&
ABSOLUTE must have especially with pets and kids I love these my kitchen feels clean and its easier then using soap and water. plus at night when every one is asleep I like to use them on the floor and they don't leave a sticky residue.	&&&
I also have the wipes not tear at all. They are also very full of the cleaning product and I have to wring them out before using. Hope this is fixed as I like Lysol better than the other brands. Also the label and lid fell off after 2 uses.	&&&
We stuff these into suitcases for use on out of town trips. Perfect for wiping down hotel rooms (and especially the TV remote!)	&&&
Huggies has the best products! I will not waste my money on any other products that will end up in disappointment!	&&&
I bought this product for a baby shower. I love bamboo fabric because it is soft and durable. The bamboo washcloths are everything that I expected. Extremely soft and pretty packaging. The new mother who received them, thought they were amazing.	&&&
Sturdy and convenient	&&&
I received a free sample. They were easy to use, gentle to my skin, and cleaned well.	&&&
Wipes don't stay wet, there's gaps all over this thing....don't understand why there are no rubber gaskets on it. You're better off buying a huggies clutch n clean From your local store. Serves the same purpose and has a strap as well. This thing is going to goodwill :-/	&&&
I absolutely love these! I use them twice daily, once in the morning and once before bed. I have pretty sensitive skin and usually can't use products like these without getting irritated, however they did the exact opposite! My acne has actually cleared up and the cucumber helps to tone down any redness. Since it is 100% natural I am also a fan:)	&&&
I tried the simple cleansing facial wipes about a month ago and just love how it makes your face feel and look. I have since tried other Simple products and I am a fan. They are great for everyday use and not too costly.	&&&
"The product never got warm so I returned it to the store."	&&&
"I love the way these wipes make my skin feel. However, they are a little pricey for something you use once and throw away. But I've never found a facial wipe that works quite as well. So, to stretch them out, I only use them every other day. And because of the size, you can easily cut them in half and put the unused portion back in the pouch. For my daily makeup removal or face freshening, I always have a few packs of cheap facial wipes from the dollar store. (Even if I could afford it, I wouldn't use these to take off eye makeup as some have suggested. That's a good way to rip out eyelashes by the dozen.)

By using them sparingly, I find that it still keeps my skin soft and clean, but I'm not taking off anything more than the dead skin and oils. When I did try to use this product daily, I often felt like my face was a little raw."	&&&
I just use these! They are very wet but the sheet is thick and soft! I have been using them for both of my kids since they were born. They could be used to clean oily surfaces too! Excellent wipes for oily plastic utensils!	&&&
big fan of these things. make my life way easier.	&&&
Love this size and value. Needs to be available all of the time!	&&&
Its very expensive but these are way better than the wipes they sell at the store. I actually like the way they smell (mild) and they do not feel caustic or give me irritation like the quat-containing wipes.	&&&
I don't have kids but my friends do and this is what they always use, even family. I know that this is the brand I will use when I decide to have a baby. I hear nothing but good about huggies. The fact that coupons are offered is even better.	&&&
These are super convenient for the diaper bag. I don't care what I do, the pacifiers always end up on the ground. He even manages to knock off the pacifier clips. As a result it's nice to have these around for when all the pacifiers have been germified and need to be made safe for tiny mouths again.	&&&
These wipes are the only ones I use after trying many others (Huggies, Pampers, Luvs... you name it). I hate when a wipe breaks in the middle of a #2 cleaning and the baby powder smell of most of other brands. These are strong, well moisturized, soft and with little to no odor. Not a great fan of the packaging, though. I put them inside Huggies' tubs (looove those tubs!) so I would prefer this value pack to come in bags with no lids. Like the 240 wipes bag with zip closing (http://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-Fragrance-Free-Baby-Wipes-80-sheets-3-count/17757449). What about a value-box with 3 or 4 of those?	&&&
"I love love love these wipes!
For my baby shower I got store brand wipes that were not as wet and moist as these wipes. Sometimes its better to pay a little more for a little better product quality.
When I wipe my baby his toosh is nice and clean (=
Happy mom."	&&&
I never purchased any kind of disposable disinfecting wipe before because we are a very "reusable" family, however, I've been under a lot of stress lately and I needed a way to take some shortcuts for certain things and ease the daily load. These have definitely done the trick! We are potty training right now and these are awesome to grab and wipe down the potty seat and the floor around it!	&&&
I have been using these on our baby (now 7 months old) to avoid diaper rash. They are soft and work really well. I haven't found any baby wipes I am able to use on him without him getting all red and irritated. Definitely a good buy!	&&&
I switched our daughter to these wipes from another popular brand. Best decision I could make! They are thick and very moist and do not dry out like other brands! The price for this size box is very good, and it is cheaper than other retailers. I got my Red Card discount and free shipping directly to my door...this is the only way I will be ordering her diapers and wipes from now on!	&&&
I absolutely love Boogie Wipes. These are perfect for when your little one has a runny nose. They don't irritate.	&&&
One of my favorite pieces of baby gear! The crinkly packets that wipes come in are a sure fire way to wake up your sleeping baby. This dispenser is quiet, dispenses the wipes one-at-a-time, and looks really nice!	&&&
In the laundry room, these are a must! use them to wipe down my dryer and any soap spots. my dusty, dingy laundry room is now like the rest of the house, presentable :)	&&&
My favorite sanitizing wipe for everything!! I know it kills the Norovirus, so it is a must in my home.	&&&
we love boogie wipes (especially the unscented ones) in our house. My daughter hates having her nose wiped, but these are far less painful and don't cause chaffing. I also use them when out and about for cleaning her face of other various messes since her skin is sensitive and baby wipes give her a contact rash.	&&&
Boogie wipes are fantastic. I use them daily on my kids noses to wipe boogies off or to wipe there face after eating. They are gentle and way better then using kleenex to do the job. They are also great wheather or not your child is sick. It totally wipes all boogies and krusties off. The scent is very nice as well. They come in a resealable lilltle pack and are easy to carry in your diaper bag, purse, or to leave in your car.	&&&
some of these don't have much moisture in them.	&&&
These wipes are so handy. They are great for mirrors and windows, but also for sinks and faucets. My husband keeps one in his car for cleanups and windshield bug removal!	&&&
Worst wipes ever. They tear every time I try to pull one out, the texture is very rough and they're too dry. I'll be going back to Pampers Sensitive.	&&&
I love how these wipes are soft yet so strong! We keep them in the diaper bag, nursery, and in the car!	&&&
Wow these are so soft! I gave these as part of a baby shower gift and my friend loves them. This baby is going to love how soft they are!	&&&
Toddler wipes are also great for use by adults. This holder is a very attractive & discreet way to have the wipes available in an adult's bathroom. The heavy weight that goes atop the wipes allows for perfect dispensing of one wipe at a time. The slow release, opening cover is a great design element. The box is very well constructed & sturdy.	&&&
Love these! Will not use any other brand. A real pain to get one wipe at a time.	&&&
I'm very happy with my order. These washcloths are nice and soft and a pleasure to use. I recommend them highly	&&&
loves this product..removes hard sticky glue from wearing needle patch to insulin pump...will continue buying this product..fast shipping too...	&&&
Works well, but a mop can do the same thing.	&&&
I was super excited to receive these adhesive removers. For some reason, I cannot find adhesive remover in the store, and so I turned to Amazon. I used to work in a pediatric hospital, and often times (or most times really) kids hate their IV tapes coming off. So we used adhesive remover, which was kinda greasy and smelled like oranges. I was really hoping for a product like that. I have been wearing patches (as a form of weight loss & energy), and I needed a good adhesive remover. While this product definitely does the job and takes the adhesion off, it is alcohol based. It dried out my skin, and made my skin feel extremely uncomfortable and itcy to where I had to apply lotion on afterward.It could also be that I have extremely sensitive skin. So while this may not have worked out for me, it may work for others. I am not sure I will honestly buy this product again, and will continue to look for non-alcohol based adhesive removers.	&&&
Lysol wipes are a must in my household. I cannot live without these things and my house feels dirty if I don't have them.	&&&
Currently the MV(baby)P in our house! With an 8 month old and 2.5 year old with runny noses from a cold/allergy combo we have a lot of snot in our house. I initially laughed and thought they were a total waste of money? But these wipes are so soft that even after multiple wipes they don't cause redness or irritation. These individual packs are perfect to store in the diaper bag? the big jug is perfect for the kitchen counter.	&&&
These are fantastic, so much better than the ones I get from my insulin pump people. They hold really well but come off fairly easily.	&&&
These are my favorite wipes. They are so much softer than any other brand	&&&
Great as always!	&&&
perfect for my needs good price	&&&
Found them very entertaining	&&&
Great wipes! I use these all over my house. No harmful chemicals like other brands! They clean very well. The scent is sort of an outdoorsy pine smell.	&&&
Works well	&&&
These bamboo washcloths are great! I bought them as a gift for my brother in law's new baby. They are extremely soft like silk which is perfect. The hems are stitched together very well so they should not come apart and unravel. They are baby shower worthy as any new mom would appreciate this product as soon as they touch it. The cloths are also a nice size. Im sure my brother in law will appreciate these! The item was received at a discount in exchange for an honest review.	&&&
These are wonderful and very soft. I had my doubts after finding out they were made out bamboo but to my surprise they are well made and eco-friendly. Great product not only for those with skin issues but also as a gift for the next baby shower. Appreciate the attention to packaging and details that put these in a different class. Thank-you.	&&&
i love these wipes! they are great for babies with skin issues !! :) I also love how they arent very scented. they are soft and do the job :)	&&&
I LOVE these and use them for EVERYTHING. They are so easy to pick up little messes, grab and wipe down the counter etc. Don't hesitate to try.	&&&
These are my go to travel wipes for my face! They are perfect for my sensitive skin but tough enough to get off my makeup from the day. I never travel without these, perfect for those who are too tired at the end of the night to do a full face washing and makeup removing. I'll stick with using Simple brand for my face routines!	&&&
I really like the sensitive pampers wipes on a newborns bum. The wipes are super soft. However when baby gets older, I prefer different wipes that are thicker to wipe with.	&&&
My son has have had no diaper rash. The wipe is super durable material. A total do.	&&&
These are my favorite facial cleansing wipes. I am a red head with very sensitive skin and can't use many products, this brand I have had amazing experience with.	&&&
I have always used Clorox wipes but ordered these on a great subscribe and save deal. I love these! The cloth is much thicker and has a texture that I feel cleans much better than Clorox wipes. I will continue to use the Lysol wipes from now on!	&&&
Definitely the best way to by these, the smaller packages go thru too quickly. I recommend these for sure	&&&
It is sooooo refreshing to find a natural product at a great price point! As moms, we all want the very best products for our babies. Many times, though, if you want to use a natural product, you have to pay big bucks. Thank you, Huggies, for offering us a great natural product at a price that real moms can afford!	&&&
To be honest, not my favorite wipes. We buy them and give them to day care because we get a good price for it at a wholesale club. However, when using them at home...they dry up super fast in the wipe warmer. (We have to unplug the warmer when these wipes are in there.) On a positive note, they are very soft. Try Huggies wipes.	&&&
We have to use these constantly because someone we have living with us has lost their immune system to a rare disorder and we use this religiously. We have not gotten sick in a year which is great for having no immune system.	&&&
These wipes are so awesome. I use them for everything! They are very universal. I have a pack in every room of the house and in all the vehicles. I have used on about all surfaces possible without any issues. Including painted walls. I have tried other wipes that were not nearly as effective (Lysol, store brands) The packaging is nice and keeps the towels moist, the towels come out easily without being sloppy and dripping liquid all over. Even though they are made by clorox they do not actually contain any bleach so there is no worry about damaging clothes or fabric. This is a staple in my home, I use them for everything from small sticky spills to dirty finger prints on the walls. It is my go to product for cleaning I panic when the supply gets to low. I would recommend them to anybody.	&&&
Old reliable is still reliable.	&&&
Like all cleansing facial wipes simple wipes are the best.	&&&
Good	&&&
These are my favorite cleaning product! They are very convenient, and do a nice job of cleaning. I am a college student, so they are my best friend when it comes to cleaning! They kill flu viruses as well.	&&&
I recently purchased a 4 pack of the Pampers Wipes Baby Fresh. I was so very disappointed in these wipes!! Too thin, and seem to be hard to hold onto. I am by far, a HUGE Pampers Brand fan!! I always have been since 1987 when I had my first child. Your products are being used by me now with my grandchildren that I am raising. However, this particular Wipe was sooo disappointing for me :(	&&&
We LIVE by these in our home! Use them multiple times a day, every single day, to clean up after my two kids. I love that they kill the cold & flu viruses so I feel better about using them then just a rag and soap.	&&&
very smooth and soft wipes. It does not leave any lint like residue which other wipes do.	&&&
Huggies wipes are super soft, smell good. And they don't irritate my sons sensitive skin.	&&&
Great value! Will order again!	&&&
These have been the best wipes for our little pumpkin!	&&&
We got this wipe warmer because it was a few dollars cheaper thanthe other one thye had. It would have been worth it to spend the extra few dollars. I put wipes in the warmer 4 days ago and they are already dried out! Every single one of them! I do NOT recomend this product. Not only did it dry out the wipes but it is also ripped the wipes almost every time I tried to pull one out. I ended up filling it about halfway thinking maybe there was too many in there and it still ripped them as i pulled them out.(I wasnt even using cheap wipes)	&&&
They're fine for a quick wipe down, great smell, I keep them in the tub in a large plastic Ziploc bag to prevent them from drying out.	&&&
"I'm not sure that this particular product could be improved.
I have to admit that I use Lysol spray quite a bit, but
when I purchased these I didn't really note the name at the time.
Subconsciously I'm sure I did, plus they might be the exact same
ones that we use at work that I've been very happy with.

I seem to remember using similar products in the past and not getting
the appropriate sheet size, graininess, thickness, and ability retain the right amount of cleaner
over the course of it's use. I use these specifically to clean CD cases and the printed side of CDs
that I buy in bulk, most of which have been sitting for a good while. I won't ever run out of these,
I think they've made it just right."	&&&
Best way to end the day with a refreshing wipe and leaves my skin soft.	&&&
Really great. Pleasant tea-tree oil fragrance. I bike to work in all sorts of weather and these beat the hell out of using normal paper towels and water. Considering attempting to run to work sometimes now that I've found these.	&&&
These wipes are soft enough to use all over baby. They won't irritate delicate skin, and they get softer the more you wash them.	&&&
I love the product. A nice thick wipe - very gentle on my skin - cleans really well. The only problem I had was that the little snap top closure came completely off of each package. I had to put the package in a ziploc bag so they wouldn't dry out.	&&&
Huggies does not disappoint with their wipes!!!!!!!	&&&
works great!	&&&
this dried out the wipes. I returned it	&&&
Lenses cleared with use but faded back within a couple of weeks. Easy to use but result did not last long at all. Followed instructions provided with cleaning and finishing wipes.	&&&
Sometimes it's necessary .	&&&
Good brand and the sensative wipes is good for babies	&&&
I've onle had this for about a week now and it woks great fits around 35 wipes keeps them nice and warm perfect for on the go comes with a car and home plug	&&&
Love these... Easiest way I have found to clean stainless!	&&&
These wipes are so convenient for quick clean ups. I keep them in my kitchen and bathroom and use them all of the time. I would definitely recommend this product.	&&&
My only comparison is to stainless cleaner from dollar store. This works a lot better and leaves stainless looking clean, it is a lot easier to accomplish with this product than with cheaper cleaners, so you get what you pay for.	&&&
"Easy to use and carry for diaper bag, changing station, bed side etc...Three pack is the best deal!!!"	&&&
These disposable wipes are the best invention ever for cleaning the bathroom. They're great for the sink, counter and around the outer parts of the toilet. Then you can just toss the germy little things in the trash instead of having to launder them!	&&&
Love the convenience and quality of this cleaning wipes.	&&&
I love using the Yes to Cucumbers Soothing Facial wipes. I have a pack of these in my gym bag and use them before and after my workouts. I like to take off my full face of makeup before I work out and then use another to refresh. They are so great. I recommend them to anyone who has somewhat sensitive skin.	&&&
Exactly what I needed at a great price.	&&&
Used these as filler for a piñata for my friend's birthday. Super fun. And they work well, too. I always keep them with me, especially when we go wine tasting.	&&&
love this product on everything. Shipped easy and fast	&&&
Working great from the minute we installed. Very easy set-up.	&&&
These pacifier wipes are a life-saver when on the go. When you have a crying infant who wants their pacifier that just fell and you don't want them putting the filth from the public floor in their mouth, these are perfect! We also use them on sippy cups and toys. They are great to have on hand!	&&&
The only wipes my daughter can use with her sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
After trying bargain wipes I can honestly say these are well worth a little more!!! When you really need effective cleaning you don't have time to take the risk of not using! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Face wipes are always a must and these are awesome ! They take off all the long days grime and don't leave a gross sticky feeling on your face. Defiantly a must buy !	&&&
love these so much my go to Disinfecting Wet Wipes i stolk up on these when they are on sale you can never have enough especially with a toddler and pet at home	&&&
These are very cool. Work as advertised. I have them in the diaper bag and will use them during our travels as well.	&&&
I really like the wipes and how easy it is to get them out to use. They clean really good!!!! Leaves a pleasant and clean fragrance too!!"}},	&&&
I personally can't stand huggies wipes, I think they are too rough and they break out my daughter's sensitive skin.	&&&
This wonderful box out an end to the stream-of-wipes problem we were having. Now we get one wipe per pull.	&&&
I love these! Works so much better than tissue use. Gently on little noses. Quick and easy to wipe those messy noses. My kids don't mind when I come for those noses with these. The wipes smell great also!	&&&
I have tried every single wipe you can imagine and these are the best. Soft, moist, the scent isn't over powering. They are my favorite!	&&&
We really like these and use them all the time. Prefer them to competitors.	&&&
Got these wipes as a baby shower gift and it's great to use. I love that's it's sensitive because using it on my newborn for first time gave me a peace of mind.	&&&
I've heard amazing things about these wipes from family members so I can't wait to try them on my baby bear.	&&&
These are so convenient	&&&
i use these wipes a lot because im always using my desk area so i like to keep everything disinfected especially since im always doing my makeup and everything else using my desk	&&&
We love these wipes. These are the only ones we will purchase.	&&&
Dry and small	&&&
The replacement sheets for the Scott Moist wipes refill have gotten smaller than the last ones I purchased back in the first of the year.	&&&
I have had good luck with these wipes. My kids have sensitive skin, and I tried these after only using Pampers Sensitive Wipes. These are slightly cheaper, as more wipes come per box. The box only has the refill packs. These have worked well for my sensitive skin children, and they only show a reaction with a bad diaper rash, upon which the only thing I use then is a wet wash cloth to wipe. Other than that, these are a winner.	&&&
Bought this product because I ran out of my regular brand. I had high expectations, but was sadly let down. These wipes fall apart as soon as you use them. I will be buying a different brand TODAY.	&&&
My daughter hates it.	&&&
These are the best makeup removing wipes out there. Gentle and calming to your face but does the job well. What more can you ask?	&&&
Great value	&&&
Love them. Our rescued Chihuahua-mix male isn't marking about every spot in the house now!	&&&
Love these! They clean great and have a nice after cent I use them for everything	&&&
It is very convenient to carry wipes protected inside the baby bag or any other bag, or hung as they have a very practical belt.	&&&
I just couldn't handle the orange vanilla scent. It reminded me of some kind of chewable tylenol memory from being sick as a kid.	&&&
I love the way these wipes smell. Good value for the price and they don't fall apart like some of the store brands.	&&&
"Easy to use at home or on the go.
Great at removing eye make-up.
No problem product ..."	&&&
The wipes came just as advertised, and were conveniently packaged. I love Huggies and have been using the Natural Care for some time because they don't seem to cause my child an allergic reaction like others I've tried. The price was right, and I'm really glad Amazon had this for sale.	&&&
Love Lysol wipes and this is an ok price. Sometimes it's just nice to not have to go to the store.	&&&
I confess: I use these on so much more than my baby's bottom. Since they are always around, I have found them to be a quick and easy option for wiping down pretty much anything... the sink, the counter, the oven. Don't tell!	&&&
Individually (and durably) wrapped for convenient purse/pocket use. The disposable cloth is soft yet very strong and leaves no sticky residue on hands (like antimicrobial gels). Sam's has the best price, but they quit caring this item in stores, so I bought 4 boxes which qualified for free shipping.	&&&
Good quality wipes. Serves the purpose indoors and outdoors.	&&&
I love these wipes they have an awesome smell and are very thick by far my favorite	&&&
Got a box as a gift and was the first time I tried this brand. The scent is light and actually smells better than some insented brand I had previously. Get a lot for your money.	&&&
My son has serious topical allergies and these wipes are the best around, and have never caused any irritation.	&&&
Very soft, do the job. No scent which I prefer. I have tried every wipe out there and these are my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
After going back to work FT and pumping, I've found these a big help making the pumping process easier. Keep them in my pump bag, quick wipe and pack up. No scent or stickiness. Love these!	&&&
Our daughter has sensitive skin and these have never caused a problem for her. They are always moist (we've never had them dry out). Even when she had made a "large" mess requiring multiple wipes, these never irritated her skin. Love the texture and have never considered using anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
LOVE these wipes! They may not be quite as cost effective as some others- but the durable wipe & gentle cleansing make them worth it to me! Will forever be a Pampers Mama! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I didn't like these at all. For some reason I can smell when he pees almost immediately, and it's not like that with any other diapers. I gave 2 stars because they did keep him pretty dry and we had no blowouts but I wouldn't buy these again. I love the wipes though!	&&&
Wipes are dry and doesn't do a good job of cleaning computer screen	&&&
Not much needs to be said about theses lens cleaning wipes to convey their greatness! I have purchased Zeiss Pre-Moistened Lens Cleaning wipes for years as my go-to for cleaning my products' glass surfaces. I'll use them on my sunglasses, on my computer screen, on my cell phone screen and, of course, on my camera lenses. They never fail to remove all residue, dust, oil, or smudges, and for the price there simply isn't a better lens cleaning solution on the market. Say goodbye to marks on your glass surfaces and hello to crystal clear beauty.	&&&
These wipes are great for sensitive skin! I can only use natural & organic products on our baby girl. I've been using these wipes for awhile on her now & she hasn't had any skin reactions. They also work in our wipe warmer, some natural brands wouldn't despence correct. Happy with these & have no plans to switch. :)	&&&
It is great to have a natural option from my favorite diaper brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Great fragrance and large enough for just one wipe!! Some wipes are tiny and require two for full hand cleaning. These are just right and are moistened at just the right ratio. Ordered online since my local Sam's quit carrying it in the store. Bummer, but shipping was fast and the price was reasonable. Other sites charge way more.	&&&
Excellent, these are the best premoistened wipes I've ever had. It's definitely worth the price.	&&&
"We have three kids and I can honestly say I have NEVER used a better diaper wipe. These blow even my faves (Kirkland) out of the water. These do not tear, moisture level is good and the texture gets all the nasty bits off the skin. I think we're using these until all three kids are potty trained and perhaps after.

The only thing I do not like is the tub itself. It's really cheaply made and it doesn't seal tight enough which can sometimes dry out your wipes a bit. I solved this by using an older container of Huggies."	&&&
This makes removing my kids insulin pump sites a much better experience. It used to be very painful.	&&&
Travel tons with work. I always take 1 or two with me. Son does to for school.	&&&
Every 3 months I buy a box of 500 count. The texture is very comfy for my baby and I like how I can wipe him without using so many wipes each time.	&&&
Great and did not have to go to the village and walk around the store	&&&
Had a good sized tag I had to cut off but no rough edges left so not a big deal. The more you wash the better they get. They are soft yet clean very well. I love them, especially for the price. Useful for more than just bottoms, we use them instead of tissue for little runny noses and I have a few I keep in my bathroom to remove my makeup.	&&&
These are not as thick as my other wipes and the stitching has started coming out on a few after only two washes. Also seems to hold smell a little more too. Prefer my other ones...I think they are bumgenius.	&&&
Love using these wipes. They are very convient for travel.	&&&
I am in love with these little wipes, they are so soft and gentle on little noses, and they do what the name says it gets rid of "boogies" It has saline in them so they quickly remove the boogies and help out a ton when your little one has a runny nose. They protect little noses from becoming chapped!	&&&
NOT REAL CRAZY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF HUGGIES WIPES, IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE not 'MOIST ENOUGH' IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE TOO DRY ON BABY'S BOTTOM. ALSO THEY DIDNT COME OUT OF DISPENSER VERY WELL. My vote is with Huggies Natural Care!!	&&&
The convenience of Clorox Disinfecting Wet Wipes is awesome. I keep some in the bathrooms and in the kitchen. Great for quick cleanups. I just wish there was a non-chemical version.	&&&
Great wipes! Pampers Natural Clean is the way to go if you are into the all natural thing. They are great quality and you can never go wrong with all natural products!	&&&
Good wipes. No smell at all.	&&&
We have tried just about every wipe out there, and these are by far the best! Safer ingredients than the pampers/Huggies brands, and better texture than the other natural brands. Just the right thickness and just the right amount of moisture. So glad we finally found the perfect wipes!	&&&
We go through 3-4 of these wipes a day, as our Chihuahuas get their paws wiped every time they come in the house as well as a good wipe down before bedtime. We have been using these for almost 4 years and love them. Smell great and gentle on your fur babies.	&&&
I like these better than the more expensive cottonelle wipes. Being individually packaged they are great for on the go. The only problem is finding them. You can't order on-line and finding them in the store is hit or miss. Come on Wal-Mart, stock this product!	&&&
I loved these wipes at first but they do not decompose as well as we expected	&&&
can't live without wipes...what did we do to clean before this product was invented. I must have blocked out the painful memories	&&&
The part where you snap doesn't fully close which makes for dry wipes.	&&&
Love boogie wipes! They are great to wipe my baby's face after she sneezes, which happens often!	&&&
Works well on phones and glasses -- gave some to a very picky family member, who is obsessive about cleaning glasses. "You can just give me a huge pile of these," she said.	&&&
Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes are the only wipes that do not cause a rash when using on my great granddaughter. Sam's price is the best price we've found any where! I had a four dollar coupon the first time I ordered, so the price was really great!! Plus, shipping is free!	&&&
Impressed with these wipes. They were softer than some other generic brand wipes I've used. More like name brand wipes. Was very happy with my purchase and the price I got them for.	&&&
Great for travel for a quick face wash and does not irritate my perioral dermatitis.	&&&
Hard to get out of the package. Smell is eh.	&&&
The Bamboo Baby Washcloths from C L Products are the best washcloths I have ever owned! I pulled them out of the packaging and I was so impressed with how soft they were! My girls each took one right away and started rubbing their face with it like they do with their soft blankets! Even after washing the cloths they were still soft! I love how they are more absorbent than other washcloths! Plus, it states that they are naturally anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and hypoallergenic, which is perfect for my little ones sensitive skin! My girls love these cloths at bath time and they do a great job! I received these washcloths at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.	&&&
Wow....I'm in the military and when you go to the field toliet paper does not travel well. These have to be the best baby wipes on the planet. Highly recommend.	&&&
I love these wipes. I have a 6-year-old male longhair whose coat gets a little greasy. My veterinarian said this is a common male cat "thing" and to use the Earthbath wipes on him as frequently as needed. He gets a going-over once or twice a week, and these wipes make his coat clean and fluffy. Also he has asthma and the fact that these wipes are unscented and do not aggravate his condition is a huge plus. They are also my go-to for cleaning outer ears and removing the occasional dingleberry. I use these on my other three cats as well whenever they need a "bath" and they work just great for everybody.	&&&
It was like swiffering my floor with a Kleenex.	&&&
We love the different scents that you can get for the bigger kids. Just perfect for their hands and they are flushable!! I've always taught my children about being clean after you use the restroom and this just helps them out so much!	&&&
Purchased this because I loved the idea and I needed one for my diaper bag. Sadly, the lid pops off the pouch after a few uses. It's attached with glue and not that good of a glue at that. It's a waste if you ask me. Wipes can not stay moist when the lid is not attached.	&&&
Bought this for my mom and it seems to work great for her. She wanted something to make her life a little easier when cleaning floors. Seemed to clean the floors well and was easy enough for her to use. Not too bulky or heavy for her to operate.	&&&
I got these for my teen to make it easier to clean her shower and she loves them.	&&&
The best sticky skin prep for insulin pump infusion sets. Holds perfectly for up to two weeks through heavy sweat, showering and swimming.	&&&
Used in conjunction with the kit, they do a great job.	&&&
The housekeeper swears by it.	&&&
I love it. I have very sensitive skin ans this does not irritate my face and leaves it soo clean!	&&&
These are the best wipes for a babe with sensitive skin. A bit "wet" but no irritation. Love them! And much cheaper than buying them from target. individually.	&&&
"Wonderful results, leaves my glasses cleaner than the other famous lens maker's cleaners.
Wish they were a bit less expensive, but you pay for quality & convenience."	&&&
great price. good quality product.	&&&
Best value wipe!!! Both my girls love these wipes, we use them for everything!	&&&
I had never used these before I bought them but I read a review on a blog and a woman said she used them in the hospital after having a baby. I took a chance and love them. Being farther along in my own pregnancy I lazily keep them beside my bed so when I am too tired or forget to wash my face I just grab one of these and follow up with a nighttime moisturizer. They do not dry my skin! but the pregnancy has really dried me out so I have to use the moisturizer. I think these are great and may continue to by more after they run out. I think I even like them better than the Cetaphil brand I also tried.	&&&
We take these everywhere and always have them in the car for messy hands, etc.	&&&
I love getting these shipped to me in bulk. It's so much easier than buying them in the store. I even use them cleaning up the kids after they eat. The one and done towels are perfect!!	&&&
So this is the third wipes warmer we purchased and this is by far the best one from the other two. Easy to use and looks good too. Thinking about getting one for my sister-in-law since she is pregnant. Awesome gift for a baby shower :)	&&&
I was curious about these wipes when I saw it last week in the store. I'm glad i bought it because it smells amazing. It's not only great for babies but also for your face and hands. It totally compares to huggies wipes. I hope they make economy size packages of these wipes.	&&&
I love these wipes they're soft and gentle and I like the packaging.	&&&
Huggies wipes are the only ones I will use! They are thick, durable and they smell great! Love them!	&&&
I bought two canisters and there was mold on the wipes in both. Troubling anytime but especially for a child's product.	&&&
great product, much better for my baby's bottom than other wipes, as just water. Fast delivery. Would buy again.	&&&
I love my Huggies.	&&&
I loved this product for the first 4 months. Baby did not cry as much during changing. Night time changes were easier and my son was able to stay relaxed. Just don't forget to add water once a week.	&&&
I use these wipes to clean almost everything! Works well on kitchen counters, bathroom sinks, etc. I always have them handy around the house.	&&&
"good value for quantity. i love pampers products."	&&&
"I purchased these wipes to make my own baby wipes as other brands (including natural) contain harmful ingredients that I do not wish to use on my baby. The cloths are unbleached and can be reused over and over again (just throw in the laundry with the cloth diapers). The only thing I would change is that I would prefer them to be a little thicker. They won't last as long as other reusable wipes I've seem."	&&&
the best wipes the more soft I ever buy !	&&&
I find the scent of the regular pampers wipes better but I still love using these for my baby! I never choose any other brand of wipes!	&&&
I am a fan of facial wipes, as I am terrible at taking off my makeup. Simple did a great job staying on par with other facial wipes out there. The background behind their product makes me like it even more.	&&&
We have 3 or 4 doz of these, and we fold them like tissues and put them in a Prince Lionheart wipe-warmer (have never plugged it in, but it is a nice durable box that keeps them moist) with Lusa Organics baby-wipe juice. These wipes are durable - the occasional edging thread comes loose, but I haven't fixed any, I just cut the hanging thread off, and they are all still functional. They work very well!	&&&
I love Clorox Wipes. I local warehouse store no longer carries them so I decided to order through Amazon and I'm glad I did. Does not leave streaks or residue on surfaces like the other brands do. Will continue to use for my everyday cleaning.	&&&
A must have if you're in college living on campus! They're perfect and the scent is very light so it's not overwhelming. It also takes out dried stains on the floor/tables.	&&&
Fast delivery, in stock, nice price.	&&&
i dont know why but everytime i use wipes they tend to not work. and this product. was better then most. but i would def stick to the gel make up remover.	&&&
Great wipes. Not too wet, so doesn't leave diaper rash and the size of each wipe is big enough that I rarely need more than one. I have gone through many different brands and these are, by far, my favorite.	&&&
I bought these because I threw my pad away after my first child. Eight years later I had another child and my wipe warmer I packed away still worked and I just needed the replacement pad. It keeps the wipes nice and warm and doesn't dry them out.	&&&
You get a lot for your money. I love this wipes thanks! :)	&&&
Love the wipes, smell amazing and so soft! This case is the only one I'll buy. Saves so much money in the long run.	&&&
My grandson's mother did not like the way these wipes smelled or the quality of the wipes. She asked me not to order any more of these brand wipes. Fast delivery.	&&&
I have sensitive and acne prone skin and I think these work great for my skin. They remove makeup so well and even take off waterproof mascara. The wipes themselves are pretty big so I like to rip them in half to make the pack go further.	&&&
The wipes are a little dry, but they cleaned my MacBook Pro laptop screen well nonetheless!	&&&
My little one has had a runny nose since she started daycare and she hates having her nose wiped. These definitely make it a lot easier because they are so soft, she doesn't mind them once she realizes how much softer than a wipe they are.	&&&
We love these wipes. These are the only ones we will purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Easy to use, really gets to makeup off, gentle, great for travel.	&&&
I am a bit particular about having sticky or dirty hands. When I go to restaurants, I don't always like to use the restroom to wash my hands so these wet towelettes come in very handy especially with little one. Work very well but only wish that they came in a recloseable bag like the one for baby wipes instead of the sticker.	&&&
My baby boy has VERY sensitive skin and is prone to diaper rash. These wipes have worked very well on his skin and do not irritate it further. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
really are unscented,dye-free,alcohol, synthetic fragrances, parabens and phthalates free.They are Baby Wipes on a Mission.I got to try them free.	&&&
Works just as good as the expensive wipes	&&&
These wipes left my sweaty skin feeling surprisingly clean and refreshed. They also have a very pleasant smell to them. The only thing I would say negative is that I was hoping they would remove eye makeup like other cleansing wipes but they didn't wipe the smudge from under my eyes. I don't wear waterproof makeup at all and was hoping it would work. Overall great for cleansing!	&&&
I used these to remove liquid lipstick, waterproof mascara, eyeliner, eye shadow and foundation. I was able to wipe off everything with one wipe because they are so strong yet gentle and very cleansing. Also, my face felt soft when I was done removing my make-up. Great product. I received it complimentary from Influenster in my Blush VoxBox but all reviews are mine.	&&&
Like these wipes. Cleans up well without using a whole bunch. Soft but sturdy.	&&&
"Love this product, I usually buy it in stores if I don`t have any left but its nice to stock up anyway.
Thanks"	&&&
Great wipes! Wouldn't use any other brand. Great price too!	&&&
These wipes are pretty good. I prefer the design of the Clorox wipes container, but if these are on sale for less than the Clorox wipes, I buy them.	&&&
I'm a fan of Clorox wipes. They're my go to cleaning supply. They are useful in the bathroom and kitchen, and you don't have to worry about carrying rags around (which, let's be honest, just spread stuff around anyways). I even have a container in my car for unexpected spills.	&&&
I have used Pampers Wipes & Diapers 9 years ago with my Daughter & now with my Son I love them even more now. They get the job done with out any worry. I would never use any thing else.	&&&
works great, less expensive than HP part, no new computer needed.	&&&
We are all grown in my household so no babies... But we enjoy having these cottonelle wipes along side our cottonelle toilet paper just to ensure everything is fresh and clean. We've been using these for years and don't plan on stopping anytime soon.	&&&
I have oily skin that really needs a good scrubbing every day. These are amazing!! My skin feels smoother and looks healthier after I use them. I would recommend these to anyone with oily skin and large pores	&&&
I've never actually used makeup remover wipes before these. I always use the makeup remover that comes in a bottle in combination with a tissue or cotton ball. With that said - I've been doing this alllll wrong! These wipes are wonderful, amazing, outstanding, and any other synonymous words. For some reason I thought they were going to smell like baby wipes, but they actually had a nice, low-key smell. I always have trouble getting my mascara off with my makeup remover, but it seriously came right off with no hassle at all. And I only had to use one wipe! The couple of extra dollars for these wipes over the bottle of makeup remover are definitely, definitely worth it! If you want to live a simple life, go with these. ;)	&&&
Very handy for cleaning pump at work	&&&
These are good wipes, we really like them and use them all the time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I absolutely love these simple skin care wipes. They leave my skin feeling so clean and refreshed. Perfect for mid day refreshing at work or a quick face wash before bed. I received this item for free for my honest review. I actually do purchase these as part of my beauty routine because they are that great.	&&&
I love these wipes as my baby has VERY sensitive skin! Other brands broke him out in whelps after he'd be cleaned off, but have not had any issues or any irritation since switching to Pampers Sensitive! These are the only wipes we use, they clean well and leave a very fresh smell! Definitely worth the money!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
my baby was allergic to the huggies wipes that we had and we tried pampers but found them too wet. these are perfect.	&&&
These wipes are great for my son who has baby eczema, which comes in hand with very sensitive skin. These truly are sensitive wipes! No perfumes, or drying alcohol, there not rough on his skin at all! They have no smell, they're so soft and have just the right amount of wetness, they clean well while being gentle on my baby boy! Never causing a rash ever!	&&&
I have sensitive skin. It's not easy for me to just use any kind of cleansing wipes or makeup removers on my face. Typically I wash my face with a liquid cleanser and then after that I use the wipes to remove anything that I missed. They have not irritated my face whatsoever and I could not be happier with the outcome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes are a must to have! They are soft and don't have a strong odor that is overwhelming. They are good to use for the face and hands. We also use them to wipe clean shopping carts or tables at restaurants. These wipes are truly the best sidekick to have with you at your side.	&&&
I love how gentle these are and they smell wonderful without being overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I wear pounds of makeup....I only had to use ONE, I repeat, ONE makeup wipe to remove all of my makeup. My usual makeup wipes take 4 wipes to take off my hard work, but these babies only take ONE. I'm absolutely flabbergasted. \r\rThese wipes also left my skin feeling quite clean and didn't give me any redness. \r\rSimple® - Micellar Makeup Remover Wipes were given to me for review, but my opinions are my own.	&&&
I have tried these when the sensitive wipes were unavailable and they worked just fine.	&&&
gets the tough boogies out! really great product you would be surprised what a difference these wipes make!	&&&
Cleans well and no rashes	&&&
This product has instructions for cleaning silver utensils but no real instructions for something common like a necklace. I have scrubbed and scrubbed on my sterling silver necklace and while black stuff seems to come off (or maybe the cleaner just reacts with silver) it never comes clean.	&&&
These wipes are my absolute favorite. They are so thick and completely perfume free. Perfect for kids bottoms that are prone to irritation. I even use on my 5 year olds bottom! Dont flush them though.	&&&
Best wipes ever but way over priced.	&&&
Great for gifts!	&&&
I love these wipes! We love fragrance free! These wipes are thick and big!!! nothing worse than a small wipe!!!! We use these for everything!	&&&
These wipes work pretty well for children with sensitive skin and allergies to fragrance. These wipes also work great for me removing my makeup. Anything that can serve two jobs is great!	&&&
These work so well on our stainless fridge. Much better than the other sprays we have purchased. It takes 2 to do the fridge front.	&&&
"Excellent product, easy to use, very convenient."	&&&
the best wipes the more soft I ever buy !	&&&
I love these. These are my go to wipes for cleaning messes on the go. Faces, hands, even feet, my little one loves taking her shoes off. Clean up fast easy freshly scented....love them.	&&&
Would buy again.	&&&
I loved scent, but most of the wipes were soaking wet! I felt like I had to get a dry towel to wipe off the baby after using them.	&&&
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are great. Convenient and handy.	&&&
4 pak and shipped home. Price was reasonable and shipping free. Does the job right and best service from SAMs club online	&&&
Excellent service. Great product.	&&&
Just gotta love these wonderful little wipes. So easy to carry, no worries about messing up your purse/briefcase as each wipe is individually sealed in tough packaging. Slight pleaant scent that dissipates as it dries. Makes it easy to clean your hands when soap and water aren't available. Always keep a few tucked in my purse and car.	&&&
My daughter is 14 months now. Been using this wipes since day 1. The only one we like among others that we tried. It is somewhat oily but i like the texture of it and it cleans very well.	&&&
Just barely enough moisture on the wipes to do the job. By the time I get half way through the package I am expecting them to be dry.	&&&
these wipes are soft and clean well, although i prefer the sensitive brand of the pampers wipes.	&&&
Puffs plus lotion are a family favorite - the only tissues bought by this household. Awesome product!	&&&
These are some great wipes for keeping those germs at bay. The price here on Amazon really can't be beat. Each pack will last about a month I have found. Both of the scents are pretty good for what they are. I have some others that I also use with these that are a little less harsh.	&&&
Great product, fast delivery!	&&&
Love warm wipes! baby really acts different during change time. Remember to keep the moisture pad really moist otherwise it starts to burn. There is a bright light on the front, it would be nice if you could turn it off.	&&&
My husband just started wearing glasses. He was constantly running water over the lens and using a lens cloth. I have 3 grand children who also wear glasses. These work perfect!! Not too moist but not as dry as some I have bought. Ready to reorder. They went fast.	&&&
Love this product, and when i share they want to where to purchase!	&&&
Those wipes are the best they are my mom's number one product for house cleaning .. It really cleans well	&&&
My 15 month old and I love these wipes! No scary chemicals and we love to have them on hand for sticky hands and faces! Worth the price, I am a bargain shopper but when it comes to my daughter and the products I use on her I like to go as natural as possible!	&&&
These wipes are the best when your little one has a crusty nose! They smell great and are gentle.y only complaint is the price. I usually just grab a baby wipe over one of there because if not you'd go through a pack a day when your child is sick.	&&&
Best wipes out there, no harmful toxins.	&&&
These wipes smell and work great. I love the texture of them although my husband thinks they tear too easily. But the cucumber scent is so refreshing.	&&&
I wish wipes smelled this good. I even use them to wipe my face. Extremely soft, Alittle pricey, but worth it	&&&
These wipes are nice and thick. Also they have the perfect amount of moistness. You dont need several at a time. I always preffered them to other brands. Would recommened.	&&&
Wish they made travel pack that was refillable but I like their wipes.	&&&
Great for quick and easy cleaning. Love to use them around, and on, any surface I've prepared meat, to remove any transmittable germs from my food preparation area. I keep a container in each bathroom for quick clean-up of surface areas. Removes germs without leaving a residue.	&&&
Great wipes! I use them for disenfecting everything in my home! Remotes, doorknobs, etc. they were great and there not overly wet and soggy like some wipes are.There also very durable and strong.	&&&
i absolutely love these cleansing wipes! I use the every day they are perfect for removing makeup and making my skin feel fresh and moisturized.	&&&
Love the Pampers Sensitive Wipes. They are gentle on my little one. I usually buy the largest box, and I love the variety that comes in it. 1 tub, refill packs and travel packs. Perfect combination.	&&&
Great price but I will not purchase again. The's wipes leave a large amount of white "fuzzies" on my baby, which then are stuck on and almost impossible to get off without taking a bath. The sheets also are very tightly folded together in the package so you need 2 hands to remove the wipe from the contsiner or u will get 4 at a time.	&&&
"I just can't believe the positive reviews. My reading glasses, phone, car navigation screen all look smudgier after I use them than before. One review says you have to blow on the item your cleaning while you are cleaning it. Seriously? It doesn't say that on the package. The directions are: ""Remove the folded cloth from packet and lightly brush away dust and grit from lens surface. Unfold lens cloth and wipe surface until clean and dry"". If you have ""dust and grit"" on your glasses you are going to need more than one of these. A little Windex on a tissue works much better. You can buy little travel spray bottles that you fill with Windex and stow them wherever you might need them--car, desk, etc. Spray the tissue lightly and then clean whatever it is you need to clean. I have a glass screen protector on my phone--not sure I would use the Windex on an unprotected phone screen.

Even if they did work I think the Zeiss wipes are expensive--even at Walmart."	&&&
These are my favorite wipes. They are strong enough to not tear, but still gentle.	&&&
It's soft and easy to use. Buyng at bulk makes it cheaper.	&&&
Works great, doesn't leave a film on hands, dries quickly	&&&
I usually love Neutrogena products but the Oil-free cleansing wipes pink grapefruit such a strong smell that I cannot use the rest of the package. I also had to rinse my skin because it was burning. I have never had such a reaction to any product.	&&&
I love love love these wipes! For my baby shower I got store brand wipes that were not as wet and moist as these wipes. Sometimes its better to pay a little more for a little better product quality. When I wipe my baby his toosh is nice and clean (= Happy mom.	&&&
Great item to have in your diaper bag.	&&&
Cheap, good, healthy.my daugther love it..i'll recomend it.	&&&
I personally don't like this product... The wipes are so unpleasant smelling and not very soft. They're a great price but with this product you def get what you pay for. If your in a pinch they'll get you by but other than that I would not recommend this product	&&&
great wipes, soft and cheap!	&&&
"These are great wipes at a great price. These are the reasons I'll be buying again: They work for sensitive skin, the packs they come in (plastic wrapper, not the tub) can be put in a diaper bag without additional storage, the tub and refill option lasted us 2 and a half months (we have a 4 month old), the price for all this is phenomenal.

We haven't had issues with the wipes drying out, but we kept them in the plastic wrapper AND tub so maybe that's why. They actually separated better that way. I did notice towards the end of the wipes they were more wet, and the last two or three would be totally saturated. Not a big deal for such a great value."	&&&
Great product use on my leather sofa after grandchildren visit - they are toddlers & well messy	&&&
Great makeup remover sheets. I use them first and then wash with soap and water. Very gentle but effective.	&&&
These are my favorite variety of Huggies wipes. I've used every kind they make, and these have the best clean scent, and are thicker which are perfect for those really messy diapers- they've saved my fingers from lots of poop. They get used on my son not just for diaper changes, but they clean up sticky fingers, messy faces, throw up, and I even use them around the house for sticky fingerprints and messes he leaves around. I've got them everywhere, so this box of refills is perfect and usually lasts me 3-4 weeks.	&&&
"These are the only wipes I will ever use on my children. They don't tear when you are wiping and they actually get little bottoms clean with far fewer wipes!
The smell is pleasant (for baby wipes) and not overpowering.
I even use these to remove my makeup. They remove mascara better than most makeup wipes and don't cause breakouts."	&&&
Best baby wipes ever. I loved the scent and the softness my son gets irritated easy with scented wipes but he did great with these wouldn't change them for anything. Thank you Huggies	&&&
Gentle facial wipes. I really like them!	&&&
i love the small packaging...instead of a bulky item...I put in the bathroom and it works great! Love this.	&&&
Super handy little kit. I love the squeegee-like wiping tool that helps you make nice, even swipes up and down (or across) the screen -- makes it easy to clean efficiently without streaks. Even has a little brush (presumably for keyboard)!	&&&
Works quite well.	&&&
Love these for cleaning my Ceramice Stove Top. Excellent, but a little Pricey.	&&&
After trying multiple brands, Simple Facial Wipes are now my go-to! It's gentle on my skin but effective in giving me that refreshed feeling after using one. And plus, it removes my makeup nice and fast!	&&&
it will break easily.	&&&
I love the thickness of these wipes because I only have to use one. however I don't know where the code is on the packaging. I didn't see one in or outside. Other than that , they're one of my favorite types of Huggies brand wipes. :)	&&&
Just love these wipes!! They have a light scent and are nonirritating.	&&&
it works perfect	&&&
Works well and removes hair dye.....immediately!	&&&
Good set of wipes. A wipe stays most fairly long to complete any regular wiping.	&&&
Excellent product!! Couldn't be happier! Will repurchase again! Works much better than the wipes! Just wished it was packaged better. I ordered two and they were rolling around in the box (unacceptable)...one of the caps cracked and a piece of it broke off from banging into each other.	&&&
I loved the concept and design of this product; however, the latch will not stay closed. My wipes are always drying up because the latch comes undone in my diaper bag (even when I adhere extra tape to the latch). I love Skip Hop's products, but I believe this case's design can be improved.	&&&
These glass wipes are so much easier to use than spraying a liquid unto my bathroom mirror and then having to wipe it clean with a paper towel.Thus the five star rating. Because my bathroom mirror gets much dirtier (inserting contact lenses, applying mascara, etc.) than my glass coffee table, which my dog likes to lick,I am always looking for a quick fix for cleaning anything that's glass. These Clorox wipes smell good, do a good job of shining not only my glass mirror but the faucet handles in the bathroom and don't streak. Will buy them again.	&&&
These cleansing wipes are great for travel, on the go after a workout or just at home. They have no scent, they are refreshing and they do a really good job cleaning your face. I don't wear makeup so I can not say anything about that. I'm definetly sending these to camp with my daughter so she can use them!	&&&
The product is fantastic, makes it easier to take and travel. Doesnt take that much space, plus live the fact that you can as well hang it in place near you.	&&&
I have been looking all over for one of these wipe containers. I found this one in grey and love it! Our family is a huge disney fan and this works perfectly for us!	&&&
I now only use pampers sensitive wipes. They are softer than any other wipes I have found and don't leave any mess behind. I would recommend them to any new mom. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes do a good job cleaning without leaving a sticky or hazy residue.	&&&
I love these to clean my face at night or on the go. Simple to remove makeup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Excellent cleaning product for home and business.	&&&
Its a must to have!! Smell good and cleans very well You don't need rags if you have these wipes their great!!	&&&
know your counters and such are super clean with these fresh clorox wipes! easy and killing germs on the daily	&&&
I absolutely love this product - my husband has to sanitize everything, since his sickness - but now we have to get them online and have to pay shipping. It is very inconvenient.	&&&
I love these to travel with because i am tired of those little plastic wipe holders, wether they are name brand or not, leaking or breaking and getting everything in the travel bag wet. Plus, the Huggie's One and Done are the thickest and most durable i have found. They clean everything from babys bum to spills and orange Dorito hands! One wipe goes a long way!	&&&
I really like these wipes. I love the lemon smell and they clean up really good. They're cheap and worth it!	&&&
cleans as expected. Looks shiny	&&&
Have three dogs-if you have a dog, you need these.	&&&
These are one of my daughters things. She has an addiction to Clorox wipes. Amazon has the best price going!!	&&&
I purchased it because the price was pretty reasonable. When I got the item, I was not happy at all. This is the first time I bought Huggies wipes. The wipes are very thick and dry. Just waste of money. I'll never purchase Huggies again and would not recommend this items to my friends. Pampers wipes are simply the great!	&&&
Worthless, np better than a panty liner but smaller.	&&&
They do the work but when you pull it out they tear to pieces	&&&
They get the job done and smell okay, but doesn't seem like a necessary buy, when you can use wipes or other tissues.	&&&
This wipes are extremely useful.. being a mother of a 1 year old.. And her dragging her toys on the floor.. This wipes are a must have	&&&
I use this to clean my face before I go to bed. It is a fast and simple way to get a thorough cleaning in a few swipes. The medicine in the wipe works extremely well on my acne-prone skin. Since I started using these particular products my skin has cleared completely and any breakouts are limited to one spot versus everywhere. They vanish in days, not weeks.	&&&
My go-to face wipes for removing makeup at the end of the day. Perfect for my sensitive skin!	&&&
2. According to the product label, this is especially useful for cleaning in kitchen and bathroom areas and also works on office equipment. It should not be used on bare wood, glasses, dishes or utensils. It disinfects some (not all) flu, salmonella and other viruses. Very dirty surfaces should first be cleaned before wiping with these disinfectant cloths. I find that the cloths themselves are a nice thickness and don't fall apart while cleaning, and also no residue is left after cleaning so that is very good. I also find that light stains are removed quickly and easily with these wipes, so I'm very pleased.	&&&
I received these wipes free to try and give my honest opinion. I really liked them they are thick and durable. My baby has sensitive skin and almost everything bothers him but these wipes were gentle, i even tried them on his face when we were out to eat and it left nothing other than a clean face. I recommend these to everyone and will be purchasing them from now on	&&&
Only wipes I will use on my son. He cannot handle the chemicals in the other wipes. These are nice and thick and durable. I received some free.	&&&
I love these wipes, they are so soft and have a fresh, clean scent that is not overwhelming. they're all i use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
These wipes are fantastic. Just the right amount of moisture, no scent and does not irritate the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
I received this as a sample in the mail and when I opened it I was already a fan. The box smelled so good! I don't wear makeup often, but that also means I have a hard time finding a makeup remover that I like, is easy, and worked well. This one did all three things. It did not leave my face feeling weird or like I needed to rinse it.	&&&
None to speak of.	&&&
I am a fan of facial wipes, as I am terrible at taking off my makeup. Simple did a great job staying on par with other facial wipes out there. The background behind their product makes me like it even more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
Love these wipes! They are soft, durable, efficient and affordable! Love Huggies products and these are no exception!! HIGHLY recommend!	&&&
These pads are great. I am so lazy, and sometimes I can't take the 2 minutes of extra effort to wash my face at night. These are just as good as washing my face. I am a bit scared to really try to remove eye makeup with them (especially mascara), but the few times that I have accidentally touched my eyes didn't hurt at all.	&&&
Favorite wipes ever! Thick, durable, smell amazing! Great for when your kid has an extra stinky doodoo and the smell seems to linger even though you've wiped and wiped. I tried pampers but I think those ones smell worse than the poop!	&&&
The wipes are soft and a good strength. Like the fragrance free wipes.	&&&
Love the wipes! Yes, they are not resealable and often stick to each other but we use them in Perfect Pull wipe dispenser and have never had any problems. My baby had a terrible irritation from the other wipes. With these ones we forgot what skin irritation is. Very gentle and natural.	&&&
"These are seriously the softest washcloths I've ever felt. They're perfect for my baby's delicate skin. They're a great size, too. Most baby washcloths are tiny and super thin. These are perfect. I also like using them on my face when washing off a facial mask. They're high quality and well-made. Bamboo is sustainable, so they're eco-friendly. They come beautifully packaged with a ribbon tied around each washcloth and would make a great gift. I'd highly recommend these washcloths for both babies and adults.

I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."	&&&
"Love these, use everyday
One canister in kitchen and one in bathrooms
The scents are great too
Makes cleaning a breeze"	&&&
These are perfect for travel since there is no liquid. It's one packet with a ziplock seal...so they are not all individually wrapped. But perfect for a week long trip to the tropics.	&&&
"These are very effective. In switching china cabinets I found a few pieces of silver dishes and a few serving utensils that needed to be freshen up. I was looking for a faster solution than the old paste type cleaning. This is a small container and the wipes are on a roll inside and you pull them out (the are attached to each other so you have to snap them off from the little tags connecting them, like paper towels only much smaller).
The more you rub the blacker the cloth and your hands will get. Hard to get the black out from under your nails, comes off hands easily.
One will nicely do three or four serving spoons that aren't too badly tarnished. If you need to wipe down a silver tray or a serving bowl you will need several. I started with a clean one and wiped until it was black, which happens very quickly, silver is always more tarnished than we realize until it gets shiny again. To maximize their use I would then use a clean one to go over the already wiped area and then move to the more tarnished area so each time I got out a new one I was maximizing it's use. My silver tray took probably 4 or 5 cloths to clean it and I would use a cloth to clean a spoon first which would not leave it very black and then use this slightly dirty wipe to move on to a more tarnished piece of silver.
Probably the paste and a soft brush would get into the design pattern on the silver a little better, but these worked very well and were definitely a time saver."	&&&
My nephew has sensitive skin and these work perfectly.	&&&
I love this product, it leaves my hands feeling soft and not sticky. These can become very addictive!	&&&
I had no problems with this order.	&&&
This is my 4th Hoover FloorMate and I swear by these things. This is the only way to properly clean a floor. My only complaint is that there used to a wider path model and I wish this was still available because it would make doing the floor go a little faster. But anyone who wants super clean floors, this is the only way to go.	&&&
I love almost everything about them except I wish they were just a little bit bigger.	&&&
So happy that I purchased these wash cloths, my baby loves using them when taking a bath!!! I did receive this product at a discount for my feedback.	&&&
"These wash clothes are amazing i use them for tons of different uses they are by far the most comfortable on a body one can imagine.

They're soft enough for washing baby's tender skin or a toddlers face after dinner instead of wasting paper towels or for bath time.

I received this item at a discounted price for an unbiased review but the opinions expressed are mine."	&&&
"I was pleasantly surprised on how soft these wash cloths are. They are super super super soft. I love how they come packaged. Each towel is wrapped individually with a ribbon. The colors are very pretty and neutral for a boy or girl. They are true to size and large. They lather well and holds up in the wash. I will definitely order more and will use these as face towels myself! Did I mention how soft they were? I love them!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
"I have five dogs and find myself constantly cleaning up after them. The FloorMate has made that job So.Much.Easier. I am able to go from vacuuming to floor washing with the turn of a button. Only downside is the number of times I have to fill up the tank, but I probably 'over clean' my floors with it.

Highly recommend to anyone with vinyl plank flooring or traditional linoleum or tile or.... you get the picture."	&&&
They are really strong and durable I love them!!!	&&&
OK but quite expensive! for what it is!	&&&
works good	&&&
"I love the feel of these bamboo washcloths! Better than my expensive cotton washcloth. I love the colors specially the purple and it absorbs the water really well. This is my first time to use a washcloth made of bamboo and will definitely stick to it.

I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchanged for my honest review."	&&&
keep making these please.	&&&
These are so soft and gentle on baby's new skin. You would think all baby wash clothes would be soft, but surprisingly that's not true. I shopped around to find the softest and these are my winners. It's worth paying a little bit more for such high quality.	&&&
This pack is great as is or even as a registry/gift item. Having the box with the refills is so helpful especially when taking wipes to daycare I can provide them with the box the first time and the refills after that.	&&&
Good to have around for when someone in your home is sick! Product is as advertised.	&&&
Great for the babies	&&&
Easy to use, like the scent.	&&&
They do what they are meant to do.	&&&
I like keeping these in my purse for on the go freshness they are awesome. Would reccomend to anyone	&&&
I used to LOVE these wipes. They didn't stink or irritate my kids' skin, and were stronger than any other wipe I've tried. However, they suddenly STINK (similar to up & up unscented wipes stink), cause rashes on my kids, and the way they open is horrible (I only get it to open correctly one out of four times). I REFUSE to buy more until you go back to the old formula! If this was a move to save money, I will pay a little more for the old wipes...	&&&
I use these a lot at night to remove make up and moisturize my face and neck, all with one great-smelling wipe that doesnt' leave my face overly greasy.	&&&
These wipes are so convenient! I loved keeping a pack in my breast pump for wiping down the parts if I wasn't in a position to wash them right away. They of course are also great for their intended purpose of sanitizing pacifiers from drop germs.	&&&
The price was higher, when i first started buying this item form COSTCO the price was less, but it still a good product	&&&
Great deal! Especially when you use subscribe and save and Amazon mom. The product is nice and you get a lot of sensitive wipes (which are great for newborns).	&&&
I have tried other brands of wipes and nothing beats Huggies, My son has sensitive skin and these are the best, they don't dry his skin out and get the job done without using a lot of wipes. I would definitely continue to use these. I love them.	&&&
I have used these Huggies wipes for all 5 of my children, not only do they smell better than the generic brand, they also clean up more!	&&&
I'm all about the waste-free home, and try to use cloth wipes whenever possible. These are soft and thick and have held up great. Sure, you can also just use a cut up old t-shirt (and we do), but anything to make diaper changes more fun, am I right? I also use these just for clean-ups, wiping my son's face after he eats, and bath time. We'll probably use them forever.	&&&
These Handi Wipes are fantastic...I use less paper towels and don't have a lot of cleaning rags that are filthy.	&&&
The Dust-Off Duster and Monitor Wipes are a must have item when owning any electronic device. Whether it's a computer, tablet, or tv you want to keep your device clean and this handy combo pack helps you accomplish this goal.	&&&
Love them, take them to work to clean my desk, phone, etc.	&&&
Works great for my camera lens and glasses.	&&&
Need these for my mom. Really convenient packaged this way. Will be getting more for sure. And its clorox. Cannot go wrong. And came in a timely manner. I definitely recommend this seller.	&&&
these work really well don't irritate or chap my little one noses and gets those hard to come off boogies they smell really great as well defiantly a fan. :)	&&&
"Great product at a a great price! Love these Lysol wipes. Great for quick cleanups and wipedowns!"	&&&
Pampers is my number one choice for diapers and wipes. I love their wipes, because they do not stick together and stay moist. I find other brands (mainly cheaper brands) do not last as long as pampers do. They tend to clump together or dry out fast. I have 2 boys and am always having to purchase wipes, pampers is my go to brand!	&&&
I like these wipes fine, but I do think they could stand to be a bit more wet.	&&&
Didnt know these were even a thing until my daughter was sick and i heard from a friend about these and tried them, there great and work well!	&&&
Love the Cottonelle flushable wipes. They are strong and don't fall apart. They leave you with a fresh ,clean feeling.	&&&
Best wipes for my baby's super sensitive butt!!! Don't even use a diaper rash cream anymore	&&&
as expected	&&&
All newborns have sensitive skin, and my daughter was no exception. We started using Pampers Sensitive Wipes when she was first born and still use them now after six months. They smell good, do the job, and are gentle on her skin.	&&&
Because of some of the poor ratings, I was wary of buying this product, but I am glad I decided to give it a try, because nothing else had worked for me. I am not sure what other reviewers who gave it a poor rating experienced, but on our Samsung stainless steel appliances, these wipes work like magic. I had tried many other products but could not get the surfaces clean. This one effortlessly wiped the surface shiny, spotless clean. At first it appeared that it would leave streaks, but once dried, the streaks were gone. I didn't have to dry, buff or do anything else after the wiping. One wipe was enough for an entire fridge.	&&&
This wipes are so wonderful, especially if your baby has sensitive skin!	&&&
this washcloths are so soft, they are really gentle on the skin. I like how the color are pretty neutral so you can give them away as a baby shower present and they will work regardless of the baby's sex. They can be use as wipes if your baby's skin is too sensitive, or you can use them to bathe your baby.	&&&
Perfect texture, no heavy scent, very handy and effective	&&&
Cleans my glasses like it says, might ned to use more than one but its great and compact and the price is a bargain.	&&&
I would give them a 5 but they tear too easily when I use them/ pull them out of the container. Love the fact that they don't have a scent since my daughter has very sensitive skin, they work well and I am going to continue to use them.	&&&
great buy	&&&
Arrived fast and as described.	&&&
"I was wanting something less harsh to clean my 5 mo old with during diaper changes so I tried this. Initially I had no problem with them, then I started to notice fuzz around his bits and bottom. I discovered that the wipes were leaving fibers on him and that they were falling appart when I wiped. They were fine for just dabbing but if I had to do anything more intense they just pulled apart :("	&&&
Great value!	&&&
Great wipes, great price!	&&&
I used these wipes to remove the gel coat nail color that was on all 10 of my nails. Removed all of the polish using one wipe (to be fair, the color was the lightest pink). It removed the polish easily and thoroughly and left my nails and cuticles so supple and soft. Felt like I had a nourishing treatment done to my nails. I will definitely recommend these! Easy to use and they worked for me!	&&&
Good deodorizer and helps with itchy skin	&&&
"GREAT job !!! My car is 10 years old & in great condition, yet the headlights were yellow & dingy & making it look older than needed. GREAT product & simple to use, would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone.
Wipe on & wipe off, VERY easy & great results !!!!!!"	&&&
They work fairly well but need to be much larger in size. Very likely I would not buy them again.	&&&
Skeptical at first but after emgency repairs to a brake system, 1 towelette cleaned my hands great. Love them will keep them in my cars at all times	&&&
I use boogie wipes ever day multiple times a day to wipe after feedings etc love the fresh scent and how soft they are on my babies face! I havebt actually needed them for "boogies" yet but use them during feeding times to wipe my sons face!! I just wish they sold them in bulk!!	&&&
Funny name, great product. Doesn't make their nose raw.	&&&
Best wipes on the market.	&&&
Amazon wanted to charge $32 for shipping...that's insane! This order also includes the tub for pulling out the wipes!	&&&
I have found my favorite cleansing wipes!! This ones doesn't irritated skin, it feels moisturizing, take off my makeup, ingredients are good and they smell amazing.. Simply like coconut! In the beginning I was more attracted because it says coconut and I'm obsessed about all about coconut fragrance since I was a child. My surprise it was great because this are my favorite one! I already purchased 5 packages to keep in stock. I love them so much!! I hope this brand never discontinued this product, if not, I will be in trouble!!	&&&
My son loves the feel of these! They're so easy to use and they smell really good. They clean really well and always leaves his little butt fresh!	&&&
not enough cleaning in the house, but this cleans just about 99.99 at a time.	&&&
A great quality product. and for a great price	&&&
It would be good for someone changing diapers in the baby's room with the warmer next to changing the baby. We are in the routine of changing our baby on our bed on a towel.? Our bedroom is closer than our baby's bedroom. Overall the wipes don't last long warm outside of the warmer. This warmer doesn't get as warm as other warmers I've pulled wipes from. I returned this item.	&&&
There is something different about these from the Johnson's wipes with yellow packaging that I see everywhere. These just smell better, feel more gentle, and overall just so much better in every way. Never want to run out of these.	&&&
I received the shea butter wipes as a free gift. At first, I wondered why would people use these instead of lotion. One day, I was in a rush and grabbed a wipe and used it on my arms, legs, and feet. I was moisturized without being greasy! I am definitely going to buy!	&&&
Great way to clean hands.Convient dispencer.Great product for the price.	&&&
These are the best!!! They are great for wiping down the lid, seat and rim of the toilet and then flushing them away. A quick clean up.	&&&
Got these as a promo deal. Can't beat the price when coupon code is applied.	&&&
I have come across a lot of different wipes (baby shower gifts) and so many of them have Strong perfumes in them. These don't, which is Great! One less thing to worry about causing irritation to my LO's bum. The wipes don't seem glued together like some other brands, where you try and pull one out of the container and you get a bundle... And the wipes aren't very rough, which is great for (again) not irritating the LO's bum. Love the pro duct!	&&&
I love my wipe warmer! My son was born in the winter and I thought he might like nice warm soft cloth wipes instead of those freezing cold disposable wipes (he did!). I use thirsties cloth wipes in this warmer and they fit perfectly folded in half. I do not use any "wipe solution" I wet them with water only and squeeze them out before putting them in the warmer. I have used this wipe warmer almost continuously for 4 years and it is just now starting to leak a little bit. I am still using it but having to wipe up underneath it every few days. I recommend this wipe warmer to all of my friends and if mine dies out I will be replacing it with another!	&&&
I love these wipes! They are perfect for baby and various other cleanup needs.	&&&
These work really good	&&&
Quality, Quantity, Affordability! Not having to run to the store, use napkins, paper towels, or toilet paper to clean your baby's bum when you run out. Priceless!	&&&
We switched into huggies after trying Pampers natural clean wipes for a while and I'm so glad I did. I love the fact that it's thicker and it doesn't rip on me during heavy jobs. Also, it's not as slimy and overly wet like Pampers - just the right amount of moisture.	&&&
After being given nothing but pampers baby fresh wipes at my daughters baby shower I have bought nothing but Baby Fresh wipes! I love the quality, the scent, and have yet to encounter any negative feed back from using them since day one. Love this product!	&&&
I love these wipes. My kids have very sensitive skin and we have had 0 problems. Also, they are soft and very sturdy. Be careful, once you buy these nothing else stacks up and thet are pretty pricey in comparison. But for my sensitive babies...worth the $	&&&
Love it!!! Very easy clean for all bath areas. Makes my bathroom shiny! Works perfect on toilet bowl ( black color).	&&&
The price for these per each of the 7 packages is a great value! One package runs for about $2. The wipes are durable, soft and don't cause us any allergy problems.	&&&
My family and I use these wipes and we are in agreement that they are definitely worth purchasing. Using the wipes along with the bathroom tissue makes you feel so much cleaner. They are not real expensive and they are gentle on your skin, which is important because I have very sensitive skin.	&&&
I like these. They still leave me feeling like I need to wash my face with water afterwards, but they are effective and not extremely harsh.	&&&
These wipes are great. I've used them multiple times and love them	&&&
These smell great and don't irritate my daughter's bum, but man are they thin! For really messy jobs I have to double or triple the wipes I use. These do an OK job if you're just using them to wipe off your little one's hands and face, but for the dirty jobs look somewhere else.	&&&
They smell like suncreen (coconut?) Which I prefer to citrus anyway, I put these in my boyfriend's car and he is getting a lot of use out of them!	&&&
Again, a staple that we use around the house quite a bit. A great time-saver to get it through Amazon.	&&&
Gets the job done but too strong.	&&&
Arrived on time, and quality is wonderful!	&&&
Gentle & strong wipes.	&&&
This stuff is the best, it makes your butt feel fresh and wonderful after each use, however; do a good job with the tp, use this to freshen up, and dispose of it in a refuse container because if you flush this stuff, I guarantee you will have to eventually get the plunger out and get plunging.	&&&
These work very good for our soft TV screens! No streaks! The first time I used these it took awhile to get the screens clean and many wipes but I attribute that to the screens being very dirty and/or having residue from other cleaners, but now I just use one for each TV to maintain. A little bit of lint leftover but a quick wipe with a duster takes that off.	&&&
I love these, but the last pack I ordered were pretty dried out compared to others I have gotten. The expiration was still a long way off, but I guess I got a bad batch.	&&&
Great Price	&&&
I use these daily and they are great at getting so many different kinds of stains, dirt, dust, and whatever it is you're trying to get off (for the most part).	&&&
great price.	&&&
I've tried so many other brands and these are by far the best! Wet enough, soft enough, thick enough. My holy grail wipes	&&&
love the texturue and neutral color	&&&
If you don't use it for a while they get a yellowish tint to them, which I'm sure is fine, but somewhat unattractive.	&&&
I have used these for seven years with my children. Work great and they have a low rating on the ewg website	&&&
This is a good product from Pampers ./ Much better then the sensitive diapers that are falling apart./	&&&
What is there to say about this product. In a water shortage they are an excellent product for taking a Navy Shower ! They far surpass Baby Wipes. Excellent product to fight Razor Burn on your face from shaving,	&&&
We started using these when my wife was pregnant and have continued to use them. They clean the kitchen, bathroom and grille very well. Great all purpose wipe.	&&&
"Very soft!!
Great for babies delicate skin."	&&&
This are great!! not only for that time of the month but also after you go number two. Though it says you can flush them i try not to. It's a bit longer than other brands but it is better in my opinion	&&&
I buy these for my grand daughter on a regular basis. they are hard to find in the local stores. They really do relax her before she goes to bed.	&&&
great deal	&&&
The cleaner did what was expected.	&&&
I can depend on these wipes to be strong and not tear and they have great smell.	&&&
Nice and thick, doesn't irritate skin or leave a residue. I use this on bottoms, faces, high chairs, wherever the mess went. Doesn't shred or fall apart. Most on the time one wipe is enough.	&&&
Yes these wipes are so soft, they smell nice (it says unscented but they do have a nice smell) and clean gently. However they are too slippery for my taste- for this reason I feel like I end up using twice as many wipes than with my preferred brand. I've always used a different brand but gave these a try. I feel like specifically because the other brand isn't slippery likes these, that with that other brand I get the job done using fewer wipes. For this reason I don't r ecommend.	&&&
Exactly as it says. I recommend this to anyone who has hemroids. Works like a charm!	&&&
These are great for glasses but not for photographic lenses as they leave a residue that must be removed by following up with a soft cloth. Photographic lenses, telescope eyepieces and corrector plates all have special coatings to improve light transmission. These delicate coatings require special care when cleaning and the less you touch them the better. I hoped these wipes would not leave any type of residue but they do and it's very difficult to remove. This is not so important for eye glasses and will go unnoticed but in the photography world and especially for telescopes you want absolute clarity and the wipes are not going to provide that. Following up with a dry cloth is never a good idea as it leads to micro scratches. In conclusion, for eyeglasses, I would give these 5 stars, but I would recommend finding something else for the delicate coatings on fine optics.	&&&
Angel Eyes used to remove tear stains quickly. The formula was changed and I'm seeing a big difference in the product but not much difference lightening tear stains.	&&&
"Best thing I've used !!!! Actually worked ,made my 1998 OEM civic lights look brand new again, will be buying more .lol
At first I was skeptical because they looked like baby wipes but nope,they surprised me."	&&&
Wouldn't use any other wipes. They are awesome!	&&&
These are great wipes. Really gentle on the babies skin. Smell great too with just the right amount of moisture to clean up those dirty butts, faces, and hands! Little pricey though compared to some that perform just as well for me.	&&&
I love huggies wipes. Thick but not linty, no scent so they are mild for new bums but still leave them fresh and clean.	&&&
"I have packs of these all around the house, kitchen, utility room, bathroom. I have two different size of these wipes; these with 35 wipes in the container, and ones with 80 wipes in the container.

I wear flip-flops all year long here in the desert so every day when I come into the utility room from outside I use these wipes to clean off my feet before going into the rest of the house. I use them in the bathroom to clean the outside of the toilet. I use them on counter-tops to wipe up messes. I like the pop-up dispenser, they smell lemony and they're pretty thick. I can actually smell the scent for awhile after using one.

I definitely plan to keep using these. I got them on a coupon with subscribe and save (and I see as of this writing there's another coupon on them)."	&&&
Great wipes at a good price. They are soft enough for their purpose, yet have some texture for scrubbing unlike store bought wipes. After the kids are out of diapers, they can be used as dusting rags or to clean up small spills.	&&&
these are the best wipes ever!!!	&&&
always have these in my house. So easy to disinfect toys and table, chairs and anything the little ones have touched!	&&&
They are so soft.I've been using the wipes for so many years	&&&
Best wipes ever doesnt bother or hurt baby even with a diaper rash pampers is perfect for newborns :)	&&&
Works as designed	&&&
I've used these for years and now can't find them at any grocery store. Thank goodness they are still available on line. Don't know what I'd do without them!	&&&
Love the smell of these and I love how convenient these are. They are great for sanitizing baby toys too!	&&&
The only wipes we use in our house! Would recommend for all ages.	&&&
Large containers excellent for commercial job that we have.	&&&
I prefer pampers wipes over any other brand. Pampers always seem to stay moist longer then any other brand I've tried and there much softer too!	&&&
Awesome Stuff!	&&&
I'm not fond of the texture and thickness (it's thin!) of this. I like the other Seventh generation wipes better.	&&&
These wipes work really well and they smell good too! I like how soft they leave my babies bottoms. We also use them to wipe runny noses. I don't feel bad about using them on their faces since they are so soft. Definitely recommend!	&&&
I use these so much that I buy them in bulk from BJ's and have them in nearly every room of the house! When you have kids, convenience is key! Unfortunately you're not saving the earth by using them, but you are saving time and energy keeping your home clean and sanitary for your family. Go Clorox Wipes!	&&&
Love these wipes...nice scent	&&&
I am addicted to these wipes. They really do leave my counter tops with a fresh, clean smell. They are also very useful at keeping the bathroom wiped down in between my weekly cleanings	&&&
I've been using these disposable wipes to keep my eyeglasses clean for years. The difference between them and the standard spritz-and-microfiber solution is dramatic. It's not just convenience; it's clarity. No streaks, no specks of dust will remain after using one of these little wipes. If you wear eyeglasses, I highly recommend them.	&&&
These wipes are the best I've tried from many brands. They hold up and are very soft on my baby! They're definitely worth the price!	&&&
Excellent to travel with, one pad works for both hands and feet for me. No mess, easy to travel and store.	&&&
I love these makeup removing wipes, they are gentle on my skin and don't cause any irritation. My skin is very sensitive so I am glad I found these wipes. It removed even waterproof makeup and I don't have to wash my face after using. I love that I can find them everywhere and they are affordable.	&&&
I bought these for ease during travel. During my 3 week trip I didn't have one break out! I've been using them ever since and NO breakouts!!	&&&
We use these everyday. So nice not to run out. They are very helpful in church children's rooms. Makes it easy to clean up.	&&&
Really good wipes, I bought it again twice for my 2 month old. Feel so good to have a large stash of these wipes.. I use only one when we have a wet diaper. They leave my baby's skin so soft, moist and hydrated when we clean up after a dirty diaper. Haven't researched if it has environmentally friendly products.. but mom and I believe LO hasn't had a rash cuz of these wipes, so they are an absolute winner in my household.	&&&
My baby hates it when I use a tissue (even the super soft ones) to wipe his nose when he's sick, but when I come towards him with a Boogie Wipe, there is no problem! I don't know how they make these so comfortable, but my baby doesn't mind using these and they are effective at getting boogies out of a little nose.	&&&
"As a busy mom of 4 I am always looking for ways to speed up and simplify my house cleaning. I was excited to try this product, as we have a home with LOTS of glass - 4 sliding doors, tons of windows (including a sun room) and tons of big mirrors.

First thing I noticed was that each canister of wipes is pretty small - only 32 in each one. This would be all fine and good, except that the wipes dry up VERY quickly while using. They work GREAT initially, when they are more wet, but very soon they dry up and you need another wipe (especially if you have lots of sticky fingerprints to scrub off, like I always do). I did find that you can turn the wipe around and there will be more liquid on the other side, and this makes it go further. I cleaned a few windows, a couple of mirrors and 2 sliding doors and used about 6 wipes. If I had cleaned ALL of the glass in my home I wouldn't be surprised if I had to use up the majority of the canister!

Also, on dirtier glass surfaces (like the outside of my door), it definitely is NOT streak-free. I had to scrub and scrub to get the streak out and was finally semi-satisfied, but it wasn't perfect.

This product may work great for you if you have no small children to put hand prints on your glass, and if you only have a few windows and small mirrors to clean. Otherwise this is just not economical."	&&&
I really like this product. I have used all sorts of wipes and not been very happy with them. These really grab the dust and leave the area looking and feeling clean. I don't feel like it pushes the dust around like some of the others I have used. I used this in conjunction with a spray for dusting and it left my house spotless. These are pretty durable too so it makes it easy to get those places that tend to get a bit dirtier and forgotten like the top of the molding around doors etc...	&&&
I bought this product to use as a safe surface cover in case we need to change our baby's diaper while we're out and about. I've used it in the backseat of our SUV several times and it's too large. It works okay on bathroom changing tables. I would have liked something more compact. The product quality is great and the material seems durable.	&&&
These do the job I want them to do...clean fingerprints and smudges from my laptop and monitor screens as well as other device screens.	&&&
excellent for MRSA, hiv, hEP c	&&&
a great cheap way to cleanse your face	&&&
Only brand I buy due to thickness and durability!!	&&&
Has anyone ever tried regular wipes? Some of burn so I can't imagine using them on a new babys butt. Been using these on my baby since newborn and they're great! A little pricy but def worth it. No issues or rashes!	&&&
They work great.	&&&
Ultra soft, great washcloths and perfect for a gift!	&&&
Amazing before and after the gym!	&&&
These are super handy for a lot of things like wiping down the fridge or appliances with a shiny finish but my main use for them is next to the bathroom mirrors. Train the family. Save yourself. :)	&&&
The softest washcloths ever. Small, sweet, just as I expected. The packaging left something to be desired (hence not a 5*) but the product itself is superb!	&&&
These do a good job of cleaning, but they do leave behind streaks and I find I have to follow up with a standard glasses cleaning cloth.	&&&
Just received these- and they're great so far! Generous size, very soft. I bought them for both my infant and I to use. I am using a retin-a product that makes my skin very sensitive, and my old "ultra soft" washcloths left my face red and irritated. The Bamby's don't at all!	&&&
"These washcloths by Naturally Nature are great! The packaging is adorable. They are each rolled up and tied with a little ribbon. They were so cute I didn't want to unwrap them. They would make a great gift. The washcloths are a large size, very soft and absorbent. After washing and drying they looked and felt just like they did when I opened them. They are great for the bath or for cleaning up a messy highchair.

I received these to test and express my honest opinion. They are GREAT!"	&&&
Nice for quick wipe down of cat's fur, removing dander or dry skin stirred up by brushing. Fur feels softer afterward.	&&&
"The Bamboo Baby Washcloths by CL Products are perfect for your newborn.
They are very soft and don't irritate the sensitive skin of the baby.
These are larger than most baby washcloths which makes them great for adults as well.
Made from bamboo they are eco-friendly, contain no harsh chemicals.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.
This is a great product and would make a wonderful gift for any new parent."	&&&
"I was pleasantly surprised when I received these washcloths most baby washcloths are so thin and small that they are pretty worthless, these are thick and soft and so easy on the skin. My baby isn't due until August but I used them on my 3 year old and they are wonderful!
I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest & unbiased review"	&&&
"My first impression of this product was, ""EWWWWWWW! STICKYYYYY!!""

It has the feeling of a table at the 24 hour, shady, greasy spoon diner that you frequent after your long night of bar-hoping that has been wiped with the same funky rag since the place opened in 1966. I donned a pair of nitrile gloves to save myself from the tacky weirdness and began to wipe the blades of the ceiling fans, (a task that hadn't been done since the construction of my apartment, probably built the same time as the greasy spoon,) and was flabbergasted at the ease and effectiveness the dust was removed. The package says one wipe can be used to dust an entire room, and I don't doubt that, though I needed one per ceiling fan given the state of them.

These are totally a life and time saver and my only regret is that I didn't discover these sooner!"	&&&
As expected. Timely arrival.	&&&
These are great for my son's skin. We have used them since birth and have always been soft. Nice packaging of a bulk, easy to refill.	&&&
Product is GREAT! But! They are sold in babies r us for waaaaaay cheaper!!!! $4.99 and on here I paid 7.69... 	&&&
They are so handy for a job I do not enjoy, they made it a breeze.	&&&
Great wipes for "surprises" or for cleaning off a dirty cat without putting it in water ;)	&&&
I love the scent of these wipes. They have a classic, soft baby smell that I love! They clean great and are super soft. The cute packaging is a plus, too!	&&&
Perfect, they are wipes and do what they say they do! cant complain and super fast shipping!	&&&
These wipes are the best!!! I love the way they smell and clean. We use these to sanitize our kitchen and some of our sons toys. I really trust this brand and this is more expensive than your typical disinfectant wipe, but they don't contain harsh chemicals and are worth the price tag with a little one in the house!	&&&
I bought this product with a coupon and have since used the whole packet. I will not be re-purchasing due to the high price. I will say that this product was very nice and gentle on my skin. I used this during the evening before bed and I found that I felt refreshed immediately after. It would be a good product to use at any point of the day though. I think that these wipes are overall nice and that Simple is a very good brand but it is over-priced especially when there are similar wipes that are much cheaper. If they were to change the price I would probably switch to these and buy these but I do not see them doing that any time soon.	&&&
I loved these face wipes! They felt great on my skin and cleaned my make up off completely!	&&&
Every baby and mom/dad loves these wipes from what i hear. They do the trick.	&&&
I love these Bamboo Baby washcloths! Would purchase again as they are super soft and are free of chemicals that can harm sensitive skin. I do not use them as baby washcloths since I do not have a baby but purchased them since I have sensitive skin. I use them to remove my makeup at night or whenever I dry my face after cleansing. They do a great job and would buy for an expected mother or someone who has sensitive skin. I was offered this product at a reduced price but my opinion is always unbiased and genuine. Hope this review is helpful!	&&&
She isn't happy about diaper changes, but she seems to be content with these wipes compares to others. Softness perhaps?	&&&
Being a first time Mom, I didn't want to make the mistake of purchasing unnecessary items. I'm so glad I bought this! Wipe warmers are silly. A wipe dispenser is a necessity! In the middle of the night the last thing you want to worry about is getting a single wipe during a diaper change. This dispenser takes care of the issue for you. And the wipes don't dry out! I'm very happy with my purchase.	&&&
Fast shipping and boxed really well.	&&&
These work just as well as the name brand wipes except much more cost effective. We use them all the time and will continue to do so.	&&&
Should get more for the money...individual wipes seem to be getting cheaper than buying bulk	&&&
I am the full - time caretaker for my 94 yr. old Dad and these wipes are just fantastic. They cleanse far better than any other product we have used, including ones the hospital gave us. The wipes leave a protective coating behind and also have a pleasant scent. My Dad and I highly recommend them	&&&
I thought these pads would be perfect to keep my cat's coat soft and remove excess hair. We both hated the smell and it left her coat sticky. I'm sticking with wet paper towels.	&&&
"Dislike walking around with colorful hands every time I use this product."	&&&
Wish they were more eco friendly	&&&
Perfect for homemade cleaning and baby wipes!	&&&
"When I noticed I was getting low on wipes I placed my order online with Walmart.com. It took 3 weeks to get to my house. I would not recommend ordering wipes online with Walmart.com if you're expecting a speedy delivery. I will say that after 1 week I did receive an email saying that there was a delay with the wipes shipment and I had the option to cancel. So I ended up going to Walmart to buy a box of these so I ended up with 2 boxes after receiving the online order. I usually use Costco's brand of wipes which are superior compared to these. Huggies and Pampers make great wipes too but they are more expensive. I decided I would try this brand (Parent's Choice) after seeing the price and reading reviews. The Parent's Choice brand wipe was smaller and did not pull off easily from the other wipes. Sometimes I would end up pulling out 5 or more wipes at a time.
It was also a lot rougher than the wipes I had previously used. They were not scratchy but just not fluffy and soft. I read the package and it did not list witch hazel as an ingredient but they smelled like witch hazel. Which I didn't mind since I like the smell but that might bother other new users of this product. The biggest concern of mine was the rash it left on my child's rear end. She is not sensitive to anything so it surprised me when I saw a rash forming on her bottom. After I stopped using the wipes and switched back to my usual brand the rash cleared up. I would say, if Parent's Choice is the only brand you've ever used and you have nothing to compare it too, just keep on using them. Just know that there are better, softer, wipes out there that will get the job done more efficiently with less wipes. I will not be buying these again regardless of price or value. I ended up needing to use more wipes with Parent's Choice which defeats the whole purpose of paying less. I will pay a few cents more per wipe for a better brand that has better quality overall. The reason I'm giving the brand 2 stars is because I'm sure there must be worse wipes out there."	&&&
Smells great, thick and soft wipes. They dont dry out babies bottom and stay smelling fresh til next change.	&&&
I don't particularly like this scent. I do like disinfecting wipes. I prefer Lysol over Clorox	&&&
These are the best and great price here.	&&&
good size and effective.	&&&
This product is cute with it's decorations on the wipes but they fall apart in my diaper warmer and I do not prefer them	&&&
"These are the best pet wipes I've tried, and I've tried a bunch. They leave your dog smelling really nice. I use them to clean my dog's face, business portions, and feet. I usually flip the wipe over to get an additional use out of each wipe. The wipes are durable and never shred.

The wipes are moist but occasionally I get a some what dry one. Otherwise I would give the product five stars."	&&&
Good product for cleaning bathrooms or kitchen floor. satisfied.	&&&
Wipes were very moist and soft. Great for sensitive skin. Very nice that they were unscented, no strong perfume smells! Worked great on my little one.	&&&
I usually like huggies wipes because they are thick & don't stick together but these ones constantly rip when pulled from dispenser & I personally can't stand their scent.	&&&
I don't understand how anyone likes the smell of these wipes and would want them anywhere near their baby. They made my eyes water and gave me an instand headache. Dad disliked them too and made everything smell like them. Yuck, never again.	&&&
This Clorox disinfectant wipes is really good when you're on the go if anything gets dirty just wipe and I its all clean, then you just throw it away.	&&&
I have been using these wipes for 2 years now with no complaints! They are sensitive enough for my son with ezcema, but they are tough enough to get the job done!	&&&
These are AMAZING to have on hand!!! I keep them in the bathrooms, the kitchen and in my car!!	&&&
I received these as a sample too, and I am so impressed! I see a lot of reviewers here talking about the taste and the feel left behind. But, makeup wipes have never been an all inclusive thing to me, its more like "prep" prior to washing your face! And I think it goes without saying, a makeup wipe is not going to taste pleasant! I use Inglot gel liner and that stuff is so super waterproof, but these take it right off!! I was amazed! After trying a few other high end brands, I was convinced wipes was one of those things you could safely go drugstore on, but no longer! And they are only a few more dollars than a drugstore brand like Ponds or Neutrogena anyway. Amazing, big, super wet wipe. Just NOT a final step, seriously, what makeup remover doesn't leave your skin sticky?? Who wants to go to sleep like that? They did not burn my eyes personally, and I have quite sensitive skin/eyes normally. As much as I LOVE wearing makeup, I love taking it off at the end of the day, and these help it to be an absolute breeze!	&&&
I love these wipes, but I need to shop around (membership stores) to make sure they are the best deal. We use wipes for EVERYTHING and these feel like they run out fast. But you can't beat Amazon dropping them at your door, so I would have to be a substantial savings for me to switch. Put them on your subscribe and save for an even better deal. They are plenty soft, and the quilted texture is my favorite for sure. And they don't bother my baby's face, so they are clearly VERY sensitive as it seems that everything bothers him!	&&&
love!!! would buy again!!! used with my toddler and now with my newborn!	&&&
I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who noticed the change for the worse. Now the wipes are just like the ones from the other warehouse club wipes which I never liked. I will now have to find a different brand to use.	&&&
These wipes are thin and hard to grip. I really like the thickness in the Pampers wipes, however I like Huggies diapers better. Go figure...	&&&
Best value in my opinion. They last a while and these are our favorite wipes to use.	&&&
We use these wipes all the time. Especially when we travel. The smell is amazing. It doesn't smell like chemicals at all. Love them!	&&&
I love how strong the wipes are from Pamer. However the smell is a little too strong.	&&&
I found these wipes to be very slimy! I prefer 7 generation. Plus I needed to use several wipes per dirty diaper. With 7 generation I can usually use 1 wipe.	&&&
I liked these wipes for the most part. I found they tend to be really wet and rip very easily. My daughter isn't one to sit still for diaper changes, so I was always in a hurry and I think I ripped just about every single one I tried to use!	&&&
These are the truly the best wipes out there. I've tried other brands but they either don't smell good or dry out. These work perfectly on my baby! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We received a very large quantity of these wipes as gifts. Used them from the day he was born until now (8 months old). After running out of the gifted quantity I went to buy more and in the diapering aisle I saw they were much more expensive than all other brands. I have also tried a grocery store brand, Luvs, Target Brand and Huggies. But I will continue to buy the Pampers wipes because I feel they hold up the best and the texture is soft, not like the scratchy other brands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
"These are by far the best facial wipes I ever used. Doesn't leave a sticky residue. Skin feels clean after. Removes even mascara with a couple of swipes. I have acne prone skin but I'm in my early 30s so finding something that doesn't irritate my skin but doesn't dry it out is a trial. These do both!
ALSO... For my bargain people:
I like to buy the double pack when Ulta has them for buy one get one 50% off and then pair them with the coupon for $3.50 off a purchase of $15 (which used to be $10... Ulta you loose points for that change). Anyway, after the discounts you pretty much paying the same amount for a double pack as you would for a single one."	&&&
I love them! I received a sample and it got me hooked in. I feel so much better as a mom now that I'm cleaning my baby with clear wipes! I have received this item for free. Opinions are a 100% my own.	&&&
these are the only wipes we use! they are an amazing product and hold up with "messy" situations! when huggies breaks down these hold up!	&&&
I love these wipes, I just wish they were packaged a bit better. Several wipes come out at once.	&&&
Our 3 month old was very sensitive at birth to the wipes. Even the higher end "sensitive" brands. Our pediatrician recommended these and we haven't had a problem since. Well worth the money and they are nice thick cloth so they never rip or soak through. Give them a try!	&&&
this product is 100% to my satisfaction .couldn't be better .	&&&
They are smaller than GermX. GermX feels more like a washcloth.	&&&
Cleaned up our cats eyes and face	&&&
They aren't very moist. I still have to use a wet washcloth to finish getting my makeup off.	&&&
Product as expected.	&&&
We love these wipes. We have used them for both of our children for the past 4 years. No issues with the wipes as we were always concerned about sensitive skin which is the reason we purchased the sensitive wipes from Pampers. By far the best quality wipes out of any of the major brands that are available.	&&&
My face feels hydrated and fresh after using	&&&
"Wow this Bamboo Baby Washcloths are really the Softest fabric I ever touched I bought them for a gift but I am keeping them for my self
I really recommend this Bamboo Baby Washcloths the antibacterial part of them is a plus no I am ordering 2 more packages
for a very special gift .I am very happy with this product.
I bought this product at a reduced cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."	&&&
I love these wipes! I've only had them for a short time and haven't used a lot of them yet, but they're great for keeping a few in a camera bag to always have with you. In the past I've used microfiber clothes but I find it hard to keep them clean and easy to use. I will definitely be using these types of wipes going forward. They do a great job of cleaning lenses of minor dust and dirt.	&&&
Baby likes them = I like them. They are soft and have just the right amount of moisture.	&&&
This is the second time i have purchased these wipes. I use them every day for my eye glasses and they work great. I have for years used soapy water and a tissue to clean and wipe my glasses but over time they got scratched. Using these wipes extends the life of my lenses. I also use them on my lenses for my SLR digital camera.	&&&
These are great. I keep them stocked because my husband gets so dirty at is job and these keep him from using his shirt, or paper towel on his glasses that could easily scratch the lens. Individually wrapped makes it convenient for him to keep a handful in his truck and or in his pocket. Can use them on your cellphone screen as well. What to watch for is the cost. Shortly after buying them on Amazon, I saw that Wal Mart had the same box for $3 less.	&&&
My dog does not complain and smells fresh! Only natural stuff for my little scrapper!	&&&
If the bathroom dust battle is driving you crazy, this the cleaning product. There are no words, thank you Clorox. Just thank you.	&&&
Very very sticky. Make sure you have some unisolve to dissolve the adhesive.	&&&
I love, love, love these washcloths Baby Soft for my sensitive adult skin! T! Very soft and gentle for the babies but of course you can use these too! I was very impressed on how adorable these washcloths are packaged.	&&&
Our bullldog has a very tightly wound tail and gets yeast infections there and in his face folds. Nothing worked until I bought these pads. Have been using them for a couple of years now. I just decided to try the wipes as well. Great pet product!	&&&
I love these washcloths! They are super soft even after 3 months of use. Pretty good quality.	&&&
We only use waterwipes after a month long battle with a yeast infection!	&&&
I use these wipes for everything not just for what it's name suggest. Great for wiping their hands face and dirty surfaces! The scent is refreshing and they don't rip and tear easily. The only thing that would be nice for them to change is the top to the package the stcker cover wears out easily and the plastic snap covers come off easily which then causes the wipes to dry out.	&&&
Love these wipes. I use a wipe warmer with these and its perfect. You can use them to clean the face or bottom and he wont cry while doing this. Great buy! Using these on a babys bottom or face is great. No chemicals.	&&&
These are terrible! Very rough and harsh on my skin. Wiping off eye makeup with these actually hurts! I don't understand how anyone could rate this product highly.	&&&
"These really do clean. They are mostly alcohol, but they work. Only downside is that I am told the alcohol is not good for some of the UV coatings that they put on glasses.

But I will still use them to clean my iPhone, iPad and my glasses that don't have any special coatings."	&&&
Great for newborns or children ith severe allergic reactions to regular scented or unscented wipes. These are truly unscented and pure. Composed of just 99% water and 1% grapefruit extract, it cleans while refreshes. If you want an alternative, buy Viva towels and use water. But in the end it will probably cost the same and why not get it in wipe form. The only complaint I have is that they come in individual packages and if you put them in a traditional plastic wipe container, they are extremely annoying to get out. I have to open the entire lid. And honestly, even in the individual package, they are a little annoying to get out. But work perfectly once on baby. The other thing I like about these is that I 'm not scared to wipe my baby's face or other part of body whereas you are told not to do that with regular wipes. One case is good enough for the first six -eight weeks of newborn sensitivity.	&&&
Love these wipes. I have tried other brands. These have just the right amount of moisture and are non-irritating. I use them daily.	&&&
I loved using this product for my baby! No leaks and full protection! A must have!	&&&
The glass wipes are not lint free, just FYI.	&&&
When it's only water and grapefruit seed extract you cannot go wrong with it.	&&&
Huggies Wipes are thick and textured to help you get more done with one!	&&&
this was a great buy	&&&
Not sure if it's necessary to wipe my TV with these but TVs aren't cheap so I do anyway.	&&&
Perfect for when I have a mess to clean, but I don't want to waste a bunch of disposable paper towels.	&&&
LOVE LOVE these washcloths!!! They are super soft and gentle for your babies skin. I used one for myself. I personally would have liked them to be a little thicker so they would lather up better. Colors are great for unisex. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a baby shower gift. I personally will use them for me and my babies.	&&&
"I never thought I would get excited over some washcloths, but it looks like I found some to get excited about. Most people use the word 'luxury' loosely so I honestly didn't know what to expect with there. When they arrived they were rolled and tied like a bow as shown in the stock photo. It looked like a cute set of washcloths for babies. Upon opening I found out these were 10""x10"" in size - a standard adult washcloth size.

I love that these are made of 100% organically grown Bamboo as I'm a fan of bamboo products and natural prodcuts in general. The colors are very lovely as well. It comes with 1 of each color as shown in the stock images. The washcloths were all VERY soft - nothing like I've experienced before to be honest. Most washcloths aren't necessarily rough, but they're thicker and just have a general towel feel to them. These aren't paper thin, but they are thinner than washcloths I am used to, but still have a quality thickness about them and they feel more like clothing or a blanket rather than a thick towel feel - if that makes sense.

During my use in a bath they felt great. They worked well and showed no signs of falling apart. They even held up well in the washing machine! So far I have nothing bad I can say about these except why did it take me so long to find them?!

*I received this product in exchange for my honest review."	&&&
Lovely scent. Does the job.	&&&
This pampers wipes are best. my baby has no problem with this wipes	&&&
VERY compact so they take up VERY little space. Only a tiny amount of water is needed to turn these tablet sized towels into a full size towel. I highly recommend this product ... especially for boating, camping, hiking or in your vehicle.	&&&
Great product. Always feel clean and fresh during that time of the month. Highly recommend them.	&&&
My son and daughter both use this product! I tried every brand and parents choice wipes and diapers are the best! I love the price and the value! Highly recommended	&&&
Perfect for the after work refresh. I use these after a day at the office and it makes my skin feel so much better. They smell nice and it seems to wipe out all the build up from the day. Neat little box and single wrapped wipes.	&&&
Love these wipes! They do a great job cleaning and always leave a fresh clean scent!	&&&
These wipes are better than most and at a great price.	&&&
My go to wipes! They've never left a rash on my daughter and they are sensitive enough for me to take off all my makeup with. They're also just the right thickness.	&&&
I love these wipes they serve the purpose!	&&&
I love these wipes! I use them for cleaning so many different things and they always work great. also they smell great too!	&&&
good wipes. Leave you clean so you don't get swamp arse (bum) later on down the road. Right next to (but not equal too) showering. I will always buy more of these.	&&&
These have the perfect moisture level, that's about all I liked. The wipes are too thin, I always feel like I need to use two. They come out of the package in one of two ways: 7 in a row all stuck together (seriously stuck, the one-handed flick-and-fling rarely separates them without several increasingly energetic attempts) and then not at all. You have to go digging around and can never find the edge so you end up pulling out a clump in desperation. Neither scenario is pleasant when things get out of hand in the diaper dept!	&&&
We have tried many brands of wipes but Pampers is always our preferred choice.	&&&
These are the only wipes I have ever used with my children. They are gentle, extra soft, and get the job done! I continue to use them with my older children for simple messes and cleanups. We love them.	&&&
i love the brand huggies !! Wipes and Pampers !! Huggies has yet to disappoint me with anything it has made.	&&&
"I have used these wipes for years. I love the quality of them. Unfortunately someone decided that they needed a new scent and now they smell HORRIBLE! They also have given one of my kids a rash. It started with the new scent.
The scent stays on your hands and they leave your bathroom smelling TERRIBLE, PLEASE PLEASE CHANGE THEM BACK. They were perfect before. I hope after reading the other reviews Kirkland will change them back"	&&&
I use these wipes in my office for kids to clean themselves after soiling their clothes.	&&&
We love this product for our new born, for the first couple of weeks we tried using honest wipes and also pampers sensitive, but felt like they had some chemical smell. Water wipes do not give any odor and also feels gentle on the skin, though they can improve the design of stacking the wipes, we would rather have a better product then go throgh some minor inconvenience	&&&
The Pampers Sensitive Wipes are a very good value; they clean well, have a clean feel, and are just the right size.	&&&
Love the thickness of these wipes! They work really well I even use them on my face sometimes.	&&&
My wife swears by these wipes, she's a nurse do very stern about sanitizer and cleanliness	&&&
No photographer should be without a pack of pec-pads/	&&&
I use this product before I wash my face with the clean & clear facial scrub. These wipes remove all dirt, and oil buildup. My skin ultimately feels clean and lightweight afterwards and it doesn't dry out my face!	&&&
We started out using this with the warmies reusable wipes and that worked great. The condensate would drip a lot and needs a towel to protect the changing table. Then we switched to disposable wipes and this still works great. No more condensate problem, but should add 1-2 oz. water weekly so the pillow does not dry out. Once it gets crispy, its done. This will be our 3rd warmer in 18 mos. But baby squirms with cold wipes, and at this price, why not make her comfortable. I will say the n ightlight is bright, we cover it with a burp cloth. You do not really need the pillows with either type of wipe as long as you keep water in there, but they are nice and last long, no mildew smell.	&&&
The "singles" Wet Ones are superior in my mind to the multiple Wet Ones because the others dry out if they are kept too long......whereas the "singles" remain in good condition no matter how long you have them	&&&
I received these free from influenster for my review and I love them. I've been interested in buying them for a while now and so glad I got to review them. Love that they clean all my make up off and don't leave my face greasy. They leave my skin soft and clean [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
My daughter has sensitive skin so I buy products that tend to the nature of her skin. These wipes are gentle on my daughter's skin, tough enough that they don't tear while using, and efficient enough to not leave behind any residue. The gentleness to toughness ratio of this wipe makes it a winner! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	&&&
We use these for bathing our newborn and wiping away the spit up from her face! They are so so soft and she seems to love it! From week 1 - a baby loves a bath...unheard of. I only took off one star because they lose softness with washing and wear...if they could find a way to perfect that - it'd be magic.	&&&
Great for all rooms in the house.	&&&
"I love Boogie Wipes for when my sons have runny or stuffy noses. They are 6 mo and 2.5 yo, so they don't understand how to blow their noses. These are so nice because they do not irritate their little noses! Also, they really do help to get the boogies out :)"	&&&
Excellent product at a great price  	&&&
works great	&&&
These were just perfect for the spa and great price, too!	&&&
I absolutely love how soft these washcloths are!! They come in a package all rolled up in a line and they are FEATHER SOFT! Amazing. Made me want to take them out immediately and give my baby boy a bath with them! They are not rough anywhere and so soft that my son loves to run his face on them! I was sent these for free or a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased oppinion. I was in no other way compensated for my review or opinion. I really do love these and they feel so good that I want to use them on my face also! I am also thinking of getting some of these for my friends as baby shower gifts! They would be perfect!!	&&&
Just what I was looking for.?  They are really gentle.	&&&
Product as advertised, with super fast shipping, as always!	&&&
works great getting the V-go adhesive goo off of me	&&&
Great wipes with no perfumes/fragrance. Very moist and durable for even the dirtiest of jobs. We have used these wipes almost exclusively since my son was born last year.	&&&
The wipes are big, soft on baby's bottom, and leave no chemical residue on hands. After using them, my hands feel clean. This is a very important factor for me, I hated that Pampers and Babyganics felt like I still had residue from the wipes on my hands. Also, fibers don't come off of the wipes like they do from other brands. They are quality. I've tried many wipes from other brands besides the ones I've mentioned, and my personal conclusion is that these are one of the best wipes. I recommend them to everyone.	&&&
"This may sound insane, but these wipes smell like my doctor's office. I hate using them. I've used Bausch and Lomb, Zeiss, and Leader lens wipes and none of them smelled like this.
They work fine for cleaning my glasses (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1), but no better than any other brand I've used.
In case it wasn't obvious, I will not be buying these again. I will stick to the other brands I listed."	&&&
These worked well with our small beagle. I did find that I had to put them on pretty tight to make sure he couldn't get out of the diaper. But the nights he kept it on, it did a nice job. It's also nice that they are disposable. My beagle is ~ 25 lbs but has a pretty wide ribcage and the side medium was a good fit.	&&&
These are perfect to use along side with the usual toilet paper. I love the reusable container and how they always stay moist.	&&&
These wipes are AMAZING!!! Not only are they long lasting, they can be used for literally ANYTHING!!! From bathroom stains to, kitchen counters to messy fridges.	&&&
These are the only cleansing wipes I will ever purchase! I dont have sensitive skin, but I try to stay from products arent very 'simple' so these cleansing wipes are perfect for me! Theyre good at removing makeup and eye makeup, but I usually use it as a cleansing wipe rather than a makeup wipe. Its great for after working out or if you dont feel like washing your face at night, these are perfect!	&&&
So far, so good...baby loves them.	&&&
Much to my surprise, these dust wipes actually work. The dust clings to the wipes and prevents the dust from circulating all over. The only thing I didn't like is that the wipes have a residue on them that makes my hands feel sticky.	&&&
"Our house is a busy one, which means it's often quite a messy one. We have a toddler, three dogs and a pretty busy schedule. We keep a pack of these in almost every room of the house and they are perfect for quick swipes. They pick up dog hair, dust and are good for light cleaning without leaving streaks. If you use them for a quick 10 minute clean before you're having someone over, they also leave a nice clean scent.

Recently, the texture of the wipes themselves have changed, but I haven't found them to be any less effective. If you need to use them on a particularly tough stain or dried mess, just cover it, pat it down and leave it for a few minutes. The Lysol solution itself is as great as ever and can break down pretty much anything."	&&&
"These are a must-have for new ostomy patients having trouble with leaks and frequent bag changes. Save your skin and have plenty of Uni-Solve on hand to remove the hydrocolloid adhesive from your skin, especially if you are finding yourself having to change out bags or flanges every day or couple of days due to leaks or other challenges. Just be sure to wash off all of the residue from your skin before applying the fresh bag/flange, or you may have trouble adhering.

These wipes also do a great job removing hospital tape and heart monitor adhesive, etc. Any adhesive residue on the skin is easily removed using Uni-Solve. It's like an eraser for glue."	&&&
Great for cleaning up those dingleberries on my long haired cat! Just wish the wipes were a little larger.	&&&
"These work REALLY well. I tried one wipe on a side of our sliding glass door that had been assaulted by my two sticky children and the wet nose and paws of a spunky Labradoodle. I was amazed that one wipe cleaned both side of the door to a streak-free shine and it immediately became the cleanest that window had been all week.

I use windex and microfiber towels usually, but these wipes are going to be such a quick solution to the sliding doors and our glass front door that need frequent cleaning. I am going to put a canister in the car to wipe off that interior windshield fog -- seriously, what is that stuff? I will also pop one canister in the guest bath too, nice for touchups on mirrors when company is due soon.

I think I will start including a can of these in baby shower baskets! If you have kids or dogs, these wipes are GREAT!

The only reason I took off a star was because I feel that the quantity vs. price is not balanced. There needs to be more wipes per canister or the price of the current canisters needs to be more economical. Other Clorox cleaning wipes are priced better and there are more wipes per canister; I hope these follow that trend in the future."	&&&
As expected.	&&&
These are pretty cool. Easier and more convenient to use in place of a rag/paper towel and spray. Worked great, even on stuck on stuff. I used it in my boys bathroom mirror and they had all kinds of stuff stuck on it and smeared and everything came off when I used these.	&&&
I really like these washcloths. They are the perfect size for bathing my baby and they are so soft and help the baby wash lather really well.	&&&
There can't stay wet long they suck ass they dont do what they say	&&&
Naturally Nature's bamboo baby wash clothes are so gentle and soft. I've never owned any bamboo material items before and I have to say they're velvety and luxurious. They're nicely packaged and ready for gifting. They're lovely soft unisex colors, great for either gender and tied up in cute little polka dot bows. They're sewn nicely with clean finished edges. I will note mine are rectangles and not squares so not 10x10 but they're all close and sewn straight and that matters more to me anyway. The wash clothes wash up nicely and still as soft as brand new. We'll get a lot of use from them. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.	&&&
"WOW....These Bamboo baby washcloths are soooo soft. Wet or dry, you wont have to worry about scratching your baby's skin. These are large enough to fit over your whole hand (10""x10"") so that its harder to lose it while bathing baby. They come in 3 pretty soft colors. All 4 edges of these washcloths are sewn to keep them from pulling apart after many uses.
I received this product at a free price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review"	&&&
"I thought that this was going to be the answer to my dirty floor problem.
Unfortunately it was not and I had to return it.
First, the brushes stopped spinning after only a few minutes of use.
Second, it hardly cleaned the floor at all. I had to make several passes over each area just to get regular dirt up.
The amount of water/cleaner I had to put on the floor to clean it was more than when I used a regular mop.
Something is not right with this unit.
Maybe I got a defective unit.
I don't know. I just know that this did not work for me at all."	&&&
SMELL GREAT AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND . THEY ALSO HOLD UP GREAT AS WELL.	&&&
I really like these wipes . They smell great feel ultra soft and work really well ... Takes all of my make up off my face and neck and leave it soft and smooth. Very pleased because it's so gentle my face breaks out quickly and these are perfect.	&&&
The scent grew on me. I've tried the natural wipes. THESE ARE REALLY THE BEST! Thanks 7th Gen!	&&&
I have not tried it but by all the reviews it looks like it is the best one out on the market	&&&
Love it! Just thick enough to do the job!	&&&
I use these wipes for my hands and to clean oil pastels. They work well and i saved money.	&&&
Love, love this disinfecting wipes, love how it' leaves your kitchen and bath smelling fresh and clean. Great sanitizing wipes at your fingertips	&&&
By looking at some comments i think this are good quality wipes i think ill tell my sister in law about this sensitive wipes!	&&&
i have tired alot of wipe brands since my son has been born but nothing works as good as huggies soft skin they help keep rashes away (son has very sensitive skin) they really are amazing i will always an forever use huggies	&&&
Pampers are way softer and moist than huggies. Huggies gave my baby rashes from being rough do not have that problem with pampers at all. Love pampers brand from wipes to diapers!	&&&
Love Huggies products, and their wipes are the only ones I'll buy	&&&
These are my favorite cloth wipes. They are very soft and wash well. I use them with my homemade wipe solution, and it works perfectly!	&&&
"I always keep a pack of the Yes to Cucumbers Hypoallergenic Facial Wipes in my gym bag for after runs or workouts. The wipes are soft and soothing, cleaning pores and cooling the skin. Having combination skin with dry patches, I was happy to find that these wipes do not require me to apply any kind of moisturizer afterwards. They make my skin feel refreshed and clean, but they allow my skin to retain it's moisture. After races, I usually use a wipe and then just reapply sunscreen.

I marked these down to an 8 because I have bought a few packs where the wipes were fairly dry. This could be an indicator of a packaging problem that allows the moisture to escape. However, all in all, I'm pretty happy with them."	&&&
The wipes are good for sensitive skin, I will give them that. However, the wipes come in a box designed to allow the wipes to 'pop-up' through a slit, and the wipes are so flimsy that they tear as you try to pull them out of the dispenser. They also tear as you try to use them to wipe! Great product if your aim is to get poop all over your hands and spend a lot of time pulling shreds of wipe out of a baby's bottom!	&&&
When I had my first baby I would try out other brands of wipes but my husband didn't like the other brands. I only buy pamper brand wipes and they do great job and now I prefer pamper wipes.	&&&
I absolutely love this product! They are sent to me bi-monthly which keeps me from buying wipes individually. You absolutely cannot beat the price! The only thing I wish is that the actual dispenser came with a refill every now and then.	&&&
I use these for my kids an myself a great stuffy nose reliver when its cold an flu season	&&&
I have used these wipes on my son since he was born and I recommend to any new mom/new mom.They are easy on his skin, don't leave red marks or rashes.And the best part is they are very affordable.Don't let the brand fool you.	&&&
I love these wipes. I'm a pampers mom, but use Huggies wipes 80% of the time. These work well and hold up. I use them to clean my one year old during diaper changes, the faces and hands of all four of my boys, and even small food messes the kids make while eating. My only complaint is packaging. I prefer small packages to carry around that tear easier. While these are not overly difficult to tear, it can be tough to pull apart one handed while changing a mobile toddler-something the smaller packs do better. Over all, great wipes for a great price.	&&&
"I accidentally bought this product when I was wanting the Neutrogena makeup remover. This morning I woke up with a bad break out all over my face. I have only been using the wipes for about three days now.

Also, the smell and burn of these wipes is enough for me to never use again."	&&&
I use these wipes to clean almost everything in the house! They are great and smell nice and clean.	&&&
I really like how soft these wipes are. They are gentle and clean well too.	&&&
I love these wipes! I use them to clean every room - to wipe off the kitchen table, the counter-tops, the fridge handles, to clean the bathroom sink and top of the toilet. They are great!	&&&
I like this product much better than similar products. I am not a huge fan of facial wipes, but this is my favorite by far. I like the concept of it being simple and natural. I like that the wipe actually cleaned my face and left me feeling refreshed. These Simple Exfoliating Facial wipes are significantly better to their counterparts, despite having a similar "look" to them. I have had problems with other brands of facial wipes in terms of too much fragrance and also facial irritation. This product seemed much more natural. These wipes did not irritate my skin; in fact they are soothing. The scent was really mild, and I didn't feel bothered by the fragrance it left behind. Overall this is definitely a product worth buying, especially if you can get it on sale.	&&&
I had a hard time getting my son to brush his new little teeth at first. This really helped. He liked the taste and even wanted to do it himself. I felt better knowing that we were getting his teeth clean. During our hotter months, these did dry out faster, but we just added a little water to the packet and kept using them until we ran out.	&&&
These are the greatest things ever made. I use them at home in the kitchen and bathroom and at school to wipe down everything.	&&&
Our little girl's diaper rash was worsening using Seventh Generation and these wipes helped us to turn it around. Seventh Generation wipes were wonderful with our first daughter but our baby's skin is more sensitive.	&&&
lol there were no perforation lines in any of the wipes...it was a big mess. A giant roll of disinfecting wipes that I have to cut with a pair of scissors...weird.	&&&
"This set of Lysol Disinfecting Wipes got the whole office through flu and cold season without a mishap. Keyboards, doorknobs, phone hand sets and buttons. Yep, we wiped down every surface that more that one person touches.
Yay Lysol Wipes!!"	&&&
These are very refreshing for a sponge bath type of cleanup. The wipes are soft, absorbent, clean up a lot of dirt and sweat, and feel nice. There is no smell that I can tell, and I am very sensitive to modern cleaner smells. There is the right amount of wetness, not too much, not too little, but they are heavy compared to a dry mini-towel and small bottle of soap that wil last much longer for less weight.	&&&
"I couldn't decide to rate it a 3 or 4. I do not like the clove smell when applying. I have sweating on my face and scalp. It dose reduce the sweating in normal circumstances, however when I work outside or am out in the heat I do not notice much difference. It is not easy to get it to the scalp through all the hair. My skin tingles/burns a little when applying and then later when I do sweat.

Since there aren't many options, I'll keep using this product."	&&&
I used these wipes for one week straight. At first, I liked the product. I found the product to be easy to use. It removed my makeup fairly quickly and it was gentle on my skin. However, I was disappointed with the fact that it did not create a lather and, therefore, I felt like it was not cleaning my face thoroughly. I am a bit of a makeup fanatic and, therefore, where a lot more makeup than the average woman. I typically dab some baby oil on cotton balls to remove my eye makeup and then wash my face with Neutrogena face wash. After using the wipes, I still found black makeup residue under my eyes and had to use the baby oil to remove it. My face also still felt dirty so I washed with my usual face wash. Using these wipes just created an added step for me. Because of this reason, I would not purchase this product. However, I will say that having these wipes around does encourage me to wash my face at night (something that I do not typically do). If I were to recommend this product, it would probably be to someone who has sensitive skin and wears minimal makeup. Otherwise, I would recommend my usual makeup removal routine.	&&&
I usually stick with Up & Up brand wipes, but I needed wipes and couldn't get to the store, and the price wasn't too bad on these. I don't really care for them after using them for a couple weeks. They aren't wet enough, and they tear apart easily.	&&&
best hand wipes ever- dedicated operative Derrick Griepenstroh, "attempted an extreme strategy" to recommend these great wipes- "special and extreme measures, "back attempt", and permanent measures for all involved in buying these great wipes- more info to be disclosed- by the way, like this great product - buy this!!	&&&
Clean up while oil painting is easier with wet ones!	&&&
Terrible. They don't come apart when you are pulling them out. I would not recommend them.	&&&
I do a lot of traveling with my daughter and pampers baby dry helps her stay non fussy during those long car rides	&&&
Life saver during my Panama trip	&&&
Good for all kinds of cleaning. I like the clorox brand smell better than other brands.	&&&
this product is excellent! Amazon mail service is the most effieient and fast service I've ever experienced. Thank You. JLB	&&&
Works well and doesn't smell too strong.	&&&
Love the pack	&&&
I love these towels!!!! I bought them at a discounted rate for a review but I'm so glad I did. I have sensitive skin and the regular washcloths are rough. These are super soft and perfect for the whole family to use. I will most definitely buy more and would recommend them to others.	&&&
Nice but it gets dry quickly	&&&
They work great & don't dry out. I feel confident they clean up the germs and keep my family safer and cleaner.	&&&
I bought this product after seeing it in a magazine -- it's exactly what I was looking for to use when I'm at work and feel like I'm sweating to death and/or smell like I haven't showered in a week! I'm not sure if this is okay, but I also use it to wipe myself off over the chest and shoulder area, in addition to the underarm area. It leaves a great smell, and I feel refreshed for the rest of the hot day!	&&&
I bought this as a gift off a friend's registry. It was shipped quickly and product was as it was described.	&&&
I love how soft and durable the wipes are. There is enough to last a month for all baby's messes. They smell good as well.	&&&
"I have used these wipes for 4 1/2 years. I find them a bit thinner than the Huggies wipes, but far less likely to tear. They have a very light, pleasant fragrance (less like a perfume, more like clean linens), and are always wet but never drippy. On the rare occasion that my daughter has a *severe* diaper rash, these wipes burn her backside, in which case I switch to wet washclothes for a day or two, but my pediatrician said that would happen with any wipe brand. My sister likes to keep one of the travel packs on hand for makeup removal- she says they take her eye makeup off quickly and easily.
This box comes with several refill packs, one dispenser, and 3 travel packs with re-closable lids: a nice variety."	&&&
These are very well priced compared to ones ordered from medical suppliers.	&&&
I have to use unscented wipes on my girls or it irritates their skin, but the problem I've been finding with alot of unscented wipes are thst they kinda smell funny to me. But these ones are the best ones I've found so far! They super soft for a wipe, and they don't have that weird smell to them. I recommend these to any parent that has a baby with a sensitive booty. I don't have any complaints about them (: plus they arrived quickly	&&&
Feeling fresh never felt so good. I saw this product featured on Fantasy Factory and had to try it. Way to go Rob.	&&&
I love these wipes. My daughter skin is sooooooo sensitive and we went through everything until we ran across these. This is the best product she had no more rash, no redness nothing.	&&&
We use these in the daycare i work at, and they smell good and its easy to clean with it. We also use them in my house as well.	&&&
These wipes are the only ones that wouldn't give my baby a rash. I love that they sell them in packs of seven	&&&
I didn't think these would work good, but they are great. So moisturizing, and so much easier than actual lotion. It wasn't greasy at all. My skin felt and smelt so good after using the Vanilla & Coconut wipes. And the smell lasted so long! Wish I would've got more than one pack.	&&&
Great wipes that are hypoallergenic and good for baby skin	&&&
Very thick, my daughter has sensitive skin. These are perfect.	&&&
They clean dust off my electronics and they are cheap.	&&&
Great timing great price	&&&
I love the Natural Care wipes. I felt like I had tried every wipe on my little girl. This was by far the best. They are thin but durable and are very gentle on her bottom. I only buy huggies products now and for the future	&&&
Oh man I have no idea what my life would be like without these wipes lol!! Used daily in just about every room or when out with baby!! Awesome product, keep it up Clorox!!	&&&
Super thick you don't need many to get the job done quickly. Did not give my son rashes like some other brands did. Just found them to have a weird smell too me.	&&&
Product took a little long to arrive. Seems to dry out a little quickly. Still think product is a great alternative to the toxic chemicals of the commercial products though.	&&&
I love this wipes! These are the only wipes I'll buy! Both my girl have very sensitive skin and it seemed to be the only wipes that helped	&&&
I absolutely love these wipes because they are super soft and they smell great and leave my baby smelling extra clean .	&&&
"I have tried grocery-store brand, Huggies, and the wipes the hospital gave us, and found these to be by far the softest. Even though my daughter doesn't have ""sensitive"" skin, I keep buying these anyway. Call me a silly first-time parent, but I only want the best for her, and I'm pretty sure these are it! They are also sturdy: don't tear, pretty thick.

The 13x Multipack box is a great value. The refill packs just make sense for the nursery, and I love the few plastic-lid/soft-sided packages that come in it, as they are perfect for the diaper bag/car."	&&&
We have been using these wipes for years now between 2 kids. My first child had super sensitive skin and these were the only wipes that worked without causing irritation. I have to say I WISH that when you pulled 1 wipe out 3 didn't come attached to them but I actually take them out and put them in the OXO wipe dispenser and it has helped a bit with that. Still my favorite wipes though	&&&
Thank you Josie, I have just ordered for the second time and I love the feel of these wipes and the way they work. Thanks again.	&&&
I love how I only need 1 wipe even for super full diapers.	&&&
My son loves these in his lunch box. They are good sized and he uses them to make sure his hands are clean before eating. :)	&&&
These are a nice size and flush well - No problems if you need to use two of them -	&&&
I love this product. I find my self using them for myself as well. I love the feel and it leaves no weird residue.	&&&
My 7yr old has been using pampers wipes ever since he was born. wouldn't have him use any other brand!!	&&&
"Love to use natural products! The clothes are super soft and packaged very cute! Would make a great gift!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review"	&&&
great for my home and an baby shower gift.	&&&
Very comfortable for the baby... the best...	&&&
Good to give the bath or powder room a quick touch-up between the regular cleaning job.	&&&
"I have recently been looking for baby items, as I am about to be a grandmother again. So I am looking for great high quality baby products that I would have loved to have had when I had my kids. And I have found it in these Bamboo Baby washcloths. They come very attractively packaged, perfect for a shower gift, and they are just too precious.
These are the softest baby washcloths I have ever felt, they are sure to be soft and gentle on your little one's skin. I highly recommend these for any new mommy as well.

"Sturdy cloth
Clean Scent
Does the job"	&&&
"I am a freak about clean car windows. The chemicals in the plastics in most new cars evaporate and deposit a film on the inside of my car's glass and it's a chore to clean it off. I use ""Invisible Glass"" - a great glass cleaner and I highly recommend it. However, unless I use a lint-free cloth to finish the glass, there is lint on the glass and that makes me crazy.

When I saw the product was from Clorox, I expected it would smell like bleach. I was wrong. It has an alcohol scent so it's easy to use in an enclosed car. Also, it cleans the glass well and doesn't leave lint. In fact, it does the best job on glass I have ever tried.

Four stars? Yeah, four - here is why. I can't figure out how to get the cloth wipes out of the container. I tried removing the cap, digging with my fingers and even asked my wife to help. No way... I get a few out and use them but getting them to pop up as designed? Not happening.

Cleans well. Frustrating to get out of the container.

Recommended if you have a high bar for frustration."	&&&
ITS LYSOL, CLEAN AWAY!	&&&
Always good	&&&
Love pampers brand all together ! My daughter is very sensitive as well as myself . We have no issues with this brand and use them all the time .	&&&
I've bought two cases of these, the first around May and the second early October. The first case was okay, seemed to cause diaper rash versus towel+water, but we were new parents then as well. Second box smells awful. I just read 10 brands of baby wipes were being recalled, so I checked if the Kirkland brand was somehow affiliated to Nutek, at least something that would explain why this batch stinks.	&&&
I bought these Yes to Cucumbers Hypoallergenic Facial wipes to clean my face from dirt and any makeup with a natural product. I have used the Yes to brand before, which was one the main reasons I decided to purchase this product, and I am happy to report that they did not disappoint. They easily cleaned my skin and left it feeling smooth and hydrated, while providing me with a sense of happiness, knowing that I wasn't pointing toxins in my body since it's a natural product. All of the Yes to products are a little expensive, but you certainly get what you pay for with this brand. Because of the natural ingredients and their effectiveness, I would prefer to buy the Yes to Cucumbers line of products for my face than I would most other brands. If you're expecting a cucumber-like scent though, be aware, that they do not smell like cucumber. The scent is very light and fresh.	&&&
i LOVE pampers wipes!! so soft and gentle, used them for all 3 of my babies!	&&&
Was told by Ethan Allen that these would be the correct wipes for my colored leather chairs, unfortunately they did not remove any dirt, but dust. Have to use my warranty to have them come clean them.	&&&
I keep these wipes in my car & purse! You never know when you will need a wet wipe. They smell great & they are disinfecting.	&&&
This is good for removing stains on the skin, but it is a very small container and each wipe is about 2 inches x 2 inches. I keep it in a small zip-lock bag to prevent the wipes from drying-out.	&&&
Huggies brand diapers are the best. I would buy them for my first son & now with my second I still do. What's even better that you can make a huggies rewards account & add points from all diapers & wipes & then redeem them for free stuff from huggies.	&&&
Excellent- have been using for 6 months as baby wipes, cloths are still absorbent but soft.	&&&
"While I have used Clorox disinfectant wipes for a few years, I've never liked the packaging. It has been hard to get the first wipe out of the package, you had to dig to get it out - some times the prongs would prick my finger. And, heaven forbid that the next wipe falls back into the package and the process starts all over.

The wipes themselves belong in the Best Things Ever Invented Hall of Fame, along with Post It notes, velcro, etc. The wipes are better than a sponge for clean ups, mainly because when you're done wiping up, you throw away the wipe where as the sponge has to then be cleaned and hope the germs are gone.

The Lysol wipes' packaging has been reconfigured. No longer do you have to fight to get the first wipe out of the packaging! Instead of having the the plastic dispenser go across the entire opening like the Clorox wipes' package, Lysol has it only going across half the opening. This makes it extremely easy to get the wipes out whether it is the first wipe in the package or the last. I wish they'd thought of it sooner.

Lysol wipes don't have a heavy smell like other wipes. The aroma is light and doesn't linger. Another plus.

I will be giving up my Clorox wipes and will only be using Lysol wipes from now on."	&&&
Very thin but okay for dirty feet.	&&&
I really enjoyed this product! Glad I got to try it.	&&&
Best body wipe ever! I used this during the Ragnar Relay (2 day race...no showers) and it kept me feeling fresh and clean the entire time. The size is great, NO STICKY RESIDUE!!! I did use two after each leg of running, but I suspect all female users would. The scent is really fresh, no floral scent here, just fresh and clean. If you are in need of an adult wipe for use on the go, you won't go wrong with the Shower Pill athletic body wipe!	&&&
The wipes dry in seconds. Can't even use them to clean anything.	&&&
These wipes are thick and gentle. So it is good for my baby	&&&
i LOVE LOVE LOVE that these are limited ingredients (purified water, grapefruit extract) and i wanted to love these. BUT someone bought us different wipes and i realized the shortcomings of these. besides being expensive, it is hard to get just one out (it seems like you pull one out then 3 more wipes are stuck to it). the closure is a resealable tape cover, our current wipes have a plastic container with a button to open and easily dispense one at a time. our current wipes are also MUCH softer. so while i wanted to love these, i'm sticking with our new wipes.	&&&
These cloth wipes work wonders! My baby is very sensitive to regular baby wipes and was getting a rash at only a week old from us using them. I ordered these and wet them with a mixture of water, aveeno lavendar baby wash and a splash of lavendar baby oil. He hasn't had the rash come back since in over 3 weeks! It's pretty sad that if we use a regular wipe while away from home he screams because they are so abrasive, but never screams when we use the cloth wipes. Easy to use, wash in the laundry and reuse. So far, they are still in great shape as well. Very happy with my purchase!	&&&
Got some of these at my baby shower along with Huggies and several other brands. These are soft and not too wet, where as the Huggies were super wet and not as soft. I noticed that my son was a lot more fussy with the Huggies and the other brands. The pampers work amazing and he doesn't cry during diaper changes anymore. I will definitely keep buying them.	&&&
Use this daily after work to freshen up. Lightweight product that gets everything off	&&&
I have used these wipes for years and will not be without them. They work great and are compact so great for travel too. They are just a favorite of mine!!	&&&
They take the poop that is on his butt and move it to the trash.	&&&
"These washcloths are very soft. They are thin enough to get in between all the fat rolls. They are thick enough to be durable. I even tried them for my face and they worked great!!

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."	&&&
