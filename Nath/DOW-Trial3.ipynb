      "I'm a big fan of Earth's Best products. We buy their formula, and baby food. So, this review was not easy for me to make. We bought these wipes for our newborn a few months ago, hoping to use them the entire time she is in diapers. But to be honest I could not wait to finish this box and move on to something different. My biggest gripe about these, and why I'm only giving it 2 stars, is that the wipes get stuck together constantly...and by stuck I'm not talking about just sticking together like wipes usually do from time to time. I'm talking about more or less sewn together. You have to practically tear them apart. I don't know how many times this left me frustrated while I was holding my daughters legs up with one hand, and trying to pull apart wipes with the other hand. My husband, feeling bad for me, even bought me the OXO Tot Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, which has a weight in it, making it easier to pull wipes out that get stuck together. This works great for 'normal' wipes that occasionally stick together. But there's something about the Earth's Best wipes that literally make them feel sewn together. You have to use both hands to pull them apart, and this is frustrating when you're in the middle of cleaning up a messy baby. Normally I would not give a product 2 stars because of this, but that's how frustrated I was with these wipes. I will not buy them again because of this....which is sad because other than that I think they are a good product. They are soft and easy on the skin. Yes they are a bit soapy, but it's manageable. For now, we are buying Burt's Bees baby wipes....which is also disappointing because they don't sell them in big cases like this one. Very disappointing all the way around. :(\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible that I got a faulty case. In that event, if the company were to offer me a 'second chance' so to speak on them, perhaps they could win me over again and keep me on as a loyal consumer. But until then, I am only giving it 2 stars, and I will use Burts Bees.\n",

I have never had that problem with other brands. I have to use twice as many wipes to get my son clean during his diaper changes and even then they still do not clean as well as other wipes. Luckily I don't have a fussy baby because sometimes I have put extra pressure on him to get him clean with these wipes. These are absolutely an inferior product. I thought I would try them to save a little money, never again. I will never buy nor recommend these wipes to anyone.\n",

It's not the Arctic but unless you keep your house at 85 degrees or something absurd your wipes are going to be cold and that's a shock to a tiny baby.\n",

      "I've tried other cleansing wipes and really am sold with The Body Shop Tea Tree Cleansing Wipes. First of all, I adore the smell. Some might not, especially if they don't like the smell of Tea Tree Oil, but I do so that's a plus. Then, I love how cool and refreshing the wipes feel against my skin, soft and gentle. But the best part of it is of course the cleansing power. I initially expected these wipes to just take off the first, obvious layer of makeup but I'd still have to wash my face to get a true clean. However, on my light makeup days, when I'm just wearing a little blush, mascara and simple eye shadow, I can use 1 wipe (front and back) and am left with a squeaky clean face. I even test it by using my toner and swiping my face with a white cotton round to see what's left on my face to find it's really clean. The only exception is if/when I've had a heavier hand applying my mascara and then I may use 2 wipes that day. But the great news is I don't have to feel worried or guilty for not following up with a true wash and rinse of my face because the wipes did the trick!\n",

I was not particularly unhappy with the Pledge wipes, but I do not think I will buy them again. They have a nice lemon scent, which is a plus, but I cannot choose how much I want to use. If something is very dusty, I do not want to have to use two wipe. I would rather use the amount of spray can Pledge that I need instead of wasting an entire second wipe.

      "keeps wipes warm, soft and the texture of the wipe seemed to feel more puffier. I like that it holds a lot of wipes and the night light is a neat feature since you don't need another one in the room. It's enough for you to see what you're doing during the night if you bought the prince lionheart diaper depot stand. I like the lid compared to the compact wipe warmer because unlike the compact, it uses a spring to \"pop\" the lid open. In this case, there's a chance for that spring to get loose inside and there is no way for you to realign it back to work again. The premium warmer is just a regular easy to open and close tab and most likely won't break for a long time with constant use. I have a 16 month old and a 4 month old right now and so far this warmer is efficient for the both of them. The only thing i'm not fond of is the ever-fresh pillow which you have to moisten every time you refill it with wipes because it dries out. That part is the key to keeping the wipes moist and soft. Other than that, I prefer this wipe warmer than the compact. I will say that if you use different brand wipes, don't expect each brand of wipe to react the same as one would the other. I suggest that you use Huggies brand since the wipe feels pillow soft and moist. I have used different brands such as parent's choice and babiesrus brand and these don't really compare to the feel of the huggies brand.\n",

It is all about personal preference. I noticed that some of the reviews stated that they shrank after drying. An easy way to avoid this is to hang them on a drying rack to dry. I like using just water on my wipes because it is easier for me and my baby does really great with just water, but I know that a lot of people put their wipes in warmers with some water and an essential oil.

The carry loop is flexible rubber which is nice and easy to wipe down along with the whole container. The top pop up opening is a little of a struggle to open. You need to put a little leverage to open it up. Pulling a single wipe out happens about 50% of the time. The other 50% more then one will pull out. Not a deal breaker as you can crame it back in and the top still closes. White color is great as you can see this clearly in your bag especially if it is at the bottom. Didn't think the color had a benefit until I was looking for it. I have a simpler case that just opens up and closes without the pop I received from someone else.

We have used and loved the purple up & up wipes ever since our first child was born. I've tried every other brand out there both expensive and cheap .....and the \"old\" Up & Up wipes for sensitive skin were the ABSOLUTE best on the market and we never used anything else until they changed them to the \"botanic\" ; kind. They used to be soft, stretchy, didn't tear up, were really moist and didn't dry out, and most importantly wiped clean without having to rub hard and didn't irritate the skin. The new ones are the exact opposite of all the pros of the old ones. So please please please Target bring them back like they were. In fact after I tried the first pack of the botanic kind and found out how horrible they were I hurried to my local target and bought up their left-overs of the big bulk boxes of the old kind. But now my stock has come to an end and I'm desperate to get them back! Hope the decision-makers for these product lines at Target read these reviews!\n",

I feel like my kids are more protected and safe from catching any viruses or the flu. I even have Lysol Dual Action Disinfecting Wipes in the car.

These wipes are easier to use than pulling out some spray cleaner and paper towels and risk spraying chemicals on everything. The scrubbing side is the best part because you can scrub off dried food stains or any other stains that need a good scrubbing and then you flip the wipe over to wipe up any leftovers. I like how these wipes are bigger than some other brands and they also are not flimsy to work with. To sanitize you have to leave the lysol solution on for 30 seconds and to disinfect you have to keep scrubbing for 10 mins. I highly recommend these lysol dual action disinfecting wipes.\n",

I have glass table tops on my dinning room table, coffee, table, and end tables. They are always getting dirty from finger prints and food. The Windex Original Glass and Surface Wipes gets all of the tough dirt, and fingerprints off the tables and the scent of these wipes is amazing. I love using these wipes to clean my mirrors around the house. I also use them to clean the windows in my car as well. They are supper handy and although small in size they are great for big jobs.

I got a great deal on a huge box of these wipes through an online retailer and was happy to not worry about having to keep an eye out for sales every time I ran out of wipes -- at least for a while. These wipes are incredibly thin and really difficult to use. I kept having problems getting my child's bottom clean with just one wipe and I thought I was losing it (I am a mom of four). But I finally figured out that because the wipes are so thin, they slide around a lot in my hand and it makes it really difficult to reach all the nooks and crannies and get the area clean. I will skip these type of Pampers wipes for now and stick with Pampers diapers.\n",

The thing I enjoy most about this brand of wipes is that they are alcohol and chloride free, creating a kid safe formula that has never been tested on animals. Thats a plus.

Our son is now 3 1/2 months and this is still one of my favorite items. The seal is still tight. It's a little heavy (probably because of the weight used to help the wipes pop) and I could see it being easy to tip over although I've never dropped it. I love the push-open top the most! It has defiantly come in handy when I've underestimated a mess mid- diaper change. The weight thing is a much better design than the other plastic cases I've seen. It stays on top of the wipes so all of the wipes \"pop up\" not just the first half. It's a generous sized opening too so I could see it being useful for cloth wipes too.\n",

The old fashioned aerosol canisters are great and still my preferred method for dusting and polishing my wood furniture but I have recently discovered these Pledge Wipes and I was most suitably impressed. Our house gets incredibly dusty very fast. I suffer from allergies and so it is important that I try to minimize the amount of dust that collects on furniture. I like the wipes as they do a great job of picking up the maximum amount of dust. It is amazing (and rather disgusting) just how much dust these wipes pick up. The form factor of these wipes are great too for dusting and disinfecting even the hard to reach areas. They work great on my tables, chairs, piano and even on the interior of my car. I like that although they are great for use on many surfaces they are also very gently and don't damage or harm my wood furniture. They even work great on my older, antique chairs. As an added bonus they really make my furniture sparkle and shine and gives the wood new life.\n",

      "I absolutely love Seventh Generation. I have yet to find a product of theirs that I did not like. When our son was an infant I purchased every single kind of wipe that was similar to this one. Our goal was to find a wipe that did the trick without all of the extra chemicals that didn't seem to make any sense why we would put into a baby wipe. If found the original wipe to meet and exceed our expectations. There is some debate on here about thickness and dry vs wetness of the wipes. Here is my opinion on the matter: I found that for an infant/baby, these wipes are more than sufficient. It really depends on how much you have to clean up. With our infant, 1-2 wipes is all we needed. Just before our son was potty trained, I found that we had to transition to a different wipe because these just didn't do the trick anymore. They are not extremely wet, but are moist enough for an infant or baby but not really what you're after if you have a toddler around the age of 2. My suggestion is to give this one a try for your little one. If you find these to be too try or thin, then move on up to the other one that they sell or another brand that compares to this one. Some find the other Seventh Generation wipes to be too soapy. I agree and wasn't a big fan of those compared to these. Hope this helps!\n",

Also, more times than not, I don't trust toilet paper in most places. I have seen toilet paper be placed on the filthy floor way too many times and to be truthful, most bathrooms just don't look or feel clean enough for me to trust their standard of hygiene. I won't go without vaginal wipes. I have these at home in my bathroom and in every bag I own. They are addictive! There are far more brands to choose from now than there used to be.

This newer version now contains a 3-pack of on-the-go wipes that contains a cover so you can close the wipes back up right on the package. At first I wasn't sure of how useful it is, since we typically just refill the plastic box with the packages. However, on our latest family trip, I discovered that the on-the-go packaging was actually quite useful so I didn't have to bring the bulky plastic box that we always did. I can see how this can also be convenient in diaper bags and in the car.\n",

My mom had rosacea, which I'm hoping I won't develop later in life like she did. Many times when I use products that say \"for sensitive skin\", my skin would still be irritable or would \"sting\" after applying lotion or something to it. These wipes are very calming (as it reads on the package). And as someone that had blemishes earlier in my life and skin drying issues and all sorts of facial issues - I can say with confidence that these work great for me! Now, everyone's skin can react differently, but for me - these are the bomb!\n",

      "I just recently started the oil-cleansing method on my face. It's great, but it could make a person have to do laundry a lot more often, because you have to change washcloths frequently. I thought that disposable washcloths would be perfect for it, and I wouldn't have to do laundry more often than I normally do. I can just throw the cloth away after using it. I also liked the idea of having a fresh face cloth every night. But with oil cleansing, you have to use a washcloth to steam your pores open. These cloths barely hold the steam at all. They get cold almost immediately. I have to keep putting them under hot water and steam separate parts of my face instead of covering my face with the cloth and steaming it all at once, as I can do with a cotton wash cloth. Plus, these aren't abrasive enough. They're too smooth (though that could be due to my being accustomed to the feel of a cotton wash cloth.) They also leave lint puffs on my face. I'm sure that these cloths are great for other things, so I'll just use them around the house for hand towels & cleaning. I bought 2 packs of cotton washcloths to use exclusively for my face instead, so I have enough to last almost 3 weeks with a fresh one every day. That way I can keep to my usual once-a-week laundry schedue and never run out of face cloths.\n",

      "I've tried so many different types of wipes (i.e. Burt's Bees, Pampers, Huggies, Seventh Generation, Kirkland, Honest Company, etc., etc.), and out of all the brands I've tried to date I have to say that these are my favorite for everyday use. I would definitely recommend these wipes to others to try. The reason for my rating is as follows: First and foremost, my baby has not had a reaction to these wipes, which was my most important consideration. There were a few brands I've tried, and I noticed baby's bum became red after repeated use. Additionally, compared to some other more \"natural\" wipe brands, these wipes are a good value for their price. I did really like another brand, but the price did not seem to justify the expense when compared with these wipes for everyday use. I also like the fact that these wipes don't have a strong smell. These wipes are durable in terms of strengh, and they aren't too wet or too dry (i.e. there was a brand of wipes I have tried which was so wet to the point they were practically driping while using them; these wipes are not that type). Finally, I like the fact that on most occasions I can pull out one or two wipes at a time; I hate those wipes where you go to grab one and you end up pulling out half the container. (Note: Upon first opening these wipes I have noticed that the first couple of wipes are sometimes diffcult to pull out. Also, when you get to the end of the package, sometimes several wipes will come out at once. However, this has been nothing compared to some other brands I've used where every single time you go to grab a single wipe, the wipes stick together such that 10 pull out at once.)\n",

It has a non-slip edge around the bottom and, so far, my cats have not managed to knock it off the bathroom counter. (In fairness, they may not have tried yet.) The lid has a plastic hinge so you can open and shut it. There's another (blue) part you can take out, to insert the wipes. Then, there's a small opening through which you can pull one wipe; this helps detach one wipe from the next at the perforation between wipes (similar to other types of wipes, like the Clorox cleaning ones). This has the effect of keeping most air out of the inner chamber of the dispenser, which in turn keeps the wipes from drying out. So the dispenser is wonderful and gets a very high rating from me.\n",

      "The wipes, on the other hand, I am not as thrilled with. They seem quite small to me. While I have not used a ruler to measure one, I'd estimate one wipe to be of similar size (but slightly different shape) as about 2/3 of a Kleenex. If you'd rather not feel the contours of your backside through a single wipe, you'd have to ball several of them up. At that rate, you'd go through them pretty fast.\n",

If you are unsure whether or not you want to use wipes in the first place, try to snag a free sample or buy a travel-sized package first so you can test them out before committing to a purchase of the full system.

These scrubbing strands are similar to the ones found in the kirland household surface cleaning wipes. Most likely a manufacturing hiccup but regardless, don't want to use the wipes on your kid's bottom if they have the scrubbing strands. There are not too many of these rough wipes in each package but every package in this batch had at least 3+ wipes that had the scrubbing strands. Also, they can appear anywhere in package: at beginning, middle, or end of wipes in the package; so you will need to check any wipe before use. If anyone else has found similar issue, please submit a review with batch id on package to help track the problem. I have never seen this issue with any other brand baby wipes so I hope kirkland has fixed this manufacturing issue.

I know this magazine does not authorize publishing of their findings (and they will actually take action for you to remove any reference to their review). I will give you a hint though, that the magazine consists of two words and those words start with the letter C and R. With that hint, you can go to any place that sells magazines and find this EXACT review I'm about to post. In this February 2014 issue on page 11, there is an article about wet wipes and their performance. When choosing a wet wipe, you want one to be strong enough to do the job, but you also need it to be weak enough to fall apart (like toilet paper) when flushed to prevent clogging. They tested four different brands of wipes, including Cottonelle, Charmin, Scott Naturals, and Walmart's Equate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first test they performed was the strength test to simulate wiping with them. They pushed metal balls through layers of wipes and all four brands passed without tearing. A comfort knowing your hand won't get messy when using these wipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second test they performed was the plumbing test, which they simulated these wipes going through your plumbing after flushed. Their test consisted mixing these wipes in a a stand mixer filled with water at the lowest setting. They admitted that this was more churning than your typical pipe provides when flushing, but all four wipes took at least 10 minutes to break into small pieces, which is considered a failure for all four brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now you may be saying \"I knew it, these are bad for our plumbing\". But not so fast... Their 3rd test was the disintegration test. What they did was let the wipes sit in water overnight (as they would in your plumbing) and only 2 of the brands disintegrated while immersed overnight. Those brands were the Cottonelle and the Scott Naturals. The other (Charmin and Equate) stayed in one whole piece despite being immersed in water overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "So their bottom line is that you should toss these in a trash can, BUT if you insist on flushing them, you need to go with Cottonelle or Scott, which by their tests are less likely to cause plumbing problems due to the disintegration factor.\n",

      "I bought both the reusable flannel and the thirsties fab wipes and have been using them for 16 months now. I highly recommend using cloth wipes of either type if you are using cloth diapers as they add no added difficulty to cloth diapering, but save a ton of wipes. If you are trying to decide between the two, though, here is how they stack up. For our use, the Thirsties have been much better and are well worth the added expense. This is due to several reasons:\n",
      "1) The thirsties are more absorbant and wipe the poop significantly better than than the flannel. Both have a more \"rough\" side and smoother side.

      "We originally started with the Pampers wipes, but my husband hated them because they always came out as one huge sheet when you pulled them from the package. So then we bought the Oxo Tot Wipes Dispenser, but the Pampers wipes still came out five at a time! Then we tried these, and we are very pleased. They always come out one at a time, and the wipe seems softer and less \"saturated,\" which I feel is more gentler on baby. My only complaint is I hate that they come in these huge bulk packages. I wish they were delivered like the Pampers wipes, in a package size that is easy to open and throw into the wipes dispenser. Plus, if you want to stock your diaper bag with these, you need another small wipes container or plastic Ziploc bag, when I was just able to put a Pampers package into the diaper bag.\n",

      "I bought both the reusable flannel and the thirsties fab wipes and have been using them for 16 months now. I highly recommend using cloth wipes of either type if you are using cloth diapers as they add no added difficulty to cloth diapering, but save a ton of wipes. If you are trying to decide between the two, though, here is how they stack up. For our use, the Thirsties have been much better and are well worth the added expense. This is due to several reasons:\n",

      "When my twins were newborns, I liked the original Seventh Generation baby wipes, and was disappointed when they were discontinued and replaced with these. As soon as the original wipes came back, I subscribed to those again. I started using the original wipes again when my twins were about a year old, and now I realize, these new ones are far better for older babies/toddlers who produce more substantial stools. They are moister and stronger. With the original wipes, I find myself using two or three at once for the initial wiping (plus several more for the whole job), and it bothers me that they are comparatively dry. These new wipes clean much better due to their greater wetness, and in direct comparison to the original wipes I do not find them rougher. They are actually the perfect wipes to clean up poops from babies that eat lots of solids. I switched my subscription back to this newer product.\n",

      "At first I thought these wipes would be great as they are thick and soft, but in actuality they've been rather frustrating. Though thick they seem to be more prone to tearing than other wipes we've used and seem a bit less effective at cleaning up particularly messy diapers. I find myself often using more wipes than I would otherwise. Additionally, we've had a lot of trouble with the wipes separating, either we end up with 3 wipes instead of the 1 we wanted or 1 comes out of the box but the next one doesn't follow requiring you to open up the box and dig out another. These don't come with a separate easy open container of any type and the individual packages contain about 200 wipes each but with a less than functional zip style top. It is functional but not particularly easy to reseal the bag, especially when also dealing with a squirming baby.\n",

      "I love pampers sensitive and was excited to buy from this seller they had such high ratings. In their product description and even in their questions section they say \"one pack of 192 comes with three inserts and there are 4 packs of 192 totaling 768 wipes, 12 inserts\" When my package arrived earlier I had a sleeve of 192 wipes. I couldn't believe I spent $33 on 192 wipes. I read further down and discovered I received 1/3 of my order. Their \"four pack\" was one set of three packages wrapped in clear plastic and then a fourth package stuck on top wrapped in more clear plastic. That is the whole \"four\" pack of wipes so I spent $33 on 256 wipes when that is not what the seller is claiming it to be. I tried to contact the seller and they have no contact information other than this. I contacted Amazon and their answer is to return it and if I want to buy the item again I can. This person is either trying to scam customers into paying for wipes they never receive or someone in packaging has no idea how to correctly fill an order. All I wanted was the other 2/3 of my order but now I have to return what I did receive wait up to 30 days for a refund and then if I want to take the risk this will happen again I can replace my order and wait for it to be processed and shipped out again. Not worth it at all to me. I'd rather find a different seller that will actually give me the product they advertised. Top Notch Bargains- Please feel free to contact me about this review, it would have been a very simple fix had you kept any sort of contact information on your page. I'm very disappointed.\n",

      "I have used these wipes for over a month now. I use them when I finish pumping at work. I pump three times a day, and when I am done, I wipe the breast shields and valves with these. Then I use the shields and valves again for the next session - no washing with soap, so they are definitely a time saver! At night I take the valves and shields home for my nanny to clean with soap and water. So far there have been no infections. That being said, you can buy \"food grade\" wipes for much less than these so I will be switching brands. I have been using the Munchkin pacifier wipes now. They are not as big as the Medela wipes, but they get the job done for a fraction of the price. Medela needs to lower the price of these if they want to stay competitive. I need three wipes per day and the Medela price is just too high.\n",

      "The main reason to chose this product over the competition such as Seventh Generation, is the amount of moisture in each wipe. There is a lot of fluid in these wipes which allows for easier cleaning. With the competition, they were bordering on dry and cleaning off dried urine, dried poop or large messes is extremely easy given the amount of moisture in these wipes. One problem with these wipes is that they clump together when you try to pull one sheet out at a time. I can see some people having an issue with this as it may be, on occasion, wasteful. But I feel the amount of moisture may be the reason they clump and I circumvent this problem by taking the wipes out and separating them before completely opening up the diaper during changing. Seventh Generation wipes had changed their formula which gave my child a rash and that was the final straw.\n",

      "These are the only brand of wipes that I've been purchasing since my 8 month old son was about 2 months. They are a little bit more expensive than the average mainstream wipes, but they are well worth the money. They smell good and they do not have all the chemicals that I don't want touching my babies' skin. Best part is that there are 12 packages of wipes so they last me 2-3 months before I need to order again. I will never use any other brand of wipes !\n"
